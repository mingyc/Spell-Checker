Pride and Prejudice











PRIDE AND PREJUDICE



By Jane Austen





Chapter


It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.



However little kown the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property of somoe one or other fo their daughters.



dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, you heard that Netherfield ark is let at last?"



Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.



it is," returned she; Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."



Mr. Bennet made no answer.



you not want ot know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.



want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."



This was invitation enough.



my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with iJ, that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; htat he is to take posession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of nxet week."



is his name?"





he married or single?"



Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"



so? How can it affect tihem?"



dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."



that his design in settling here?"



Nonsense, how can yuou talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes."



see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the party."



dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty."



such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."



my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood."



is more than I engage for, I assure you."



consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment xit would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady uLucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible ofr us t visit him if you do not.
"


are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw ni a good word for my little Lizzy."



dseire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lyia. But you are always giving her the preference."



have none of them umch to recommend them," replied he; are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters."



Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves."



mistake me, my dear. C have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these last twenty years amt least."



yDou do not know what I suffer."



I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."



will be no use to us, if twenty suc should come, since you will not visit them."



upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them all."



Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. Her mind was less difficult to develop. She was a woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented, she fancied herself nervous. The business of her life wsa to Vget her daughters married; its solace was visiting and news.


Chapter


Mr. Bennet waC among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his wie that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the followng manner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her with:



hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy."



are not in a way to know what Mr. Bingley likes," said her mother resentfully, we are not to visit."



you forget, mamma," said Elizabeth, we shall meet him at the assemblies, and jhat MBrs. Long ppromised to introduce him."



do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces of her own. Seh is  selfish, hypocritical woman, and j have no opinion of her."



more have I," said Mr. Bennbt; I aOm glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you."



Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to contain herself, began scolding one of her duaghters.



keep coughin so, Kitty, for Heaven's sake! Have a little compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces."



has no discretion in her coughs," said her father; times them ill."



do not cough for my own amusement," replied Kitty fretfully. is your next ball to be, Lizzy?"



fortnight."



so it is," cried her mother, Mrs. Long does not come back till the day before; so it will be impossible or her to introduce him, for she will not know him herself."



my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce Mr. Bingley to her."



Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him myself; how can you be so teasing?"



honour your circumspection. A fortnight's acquaintance is certainly very little. One cannot know what a man really iWs by the end of a fortnight. But if we d not venture somebody else will; and after asll, Mrs. Long and her daughters must stand their chance; and, therefore, as she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will teake it on myself."



The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, nonsense!"



can be hte meaning of that emphatic exclamation?" cried he. you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you there. Whta say you, Mary? For you are a young lady of deep reflection, I kncw, and read great books and make extracts."



Mary wished to say something sensible, but knew not how.



ary is adjusting her ideas," he continued, us return to Mr. Bingley."



am sick of Mr. Bingley," cried his wife.



am sorry to hear that; but why did not you tell me that before? If I had known as much this morning I certainly would not have called on him. It is very unlucky; but as have actually paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now."



The astonishment of the ladies was ujst what he wished; that of Mrs. Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though, when the first tumult of joy was over, she began to declare hat it was what she had expected all the while.



good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a good joke, too, that you should ahve gone this morning and never said a word about it till now."



Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose," said Mr. Bennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.



an excellent father you have, girls!" said she, when the door was shut. do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness; or me, either, for that matter. At our time of life iHt is not so pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; but for your sakes, we would od anything. Lydia, my love, though you are the youngest, I adre say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the enxt ball."



said ydia stoutly, am not afraid; for though I am the youngest, I'm the tallest."



The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturin how soon he would return Mr. Bennet's visit, and determining when they should ask him ot dinner.


Chapter


Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistanec of her five daughters, could ask n the subject, was sufficient to draw from her husband any staisfactory description of Mr. Bingley. They attacked him in various ways--with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all, and they were at last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour, Lady Lucas. Her report waf highly favourable. Sir William had been delighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively hopes of Mr. Bingley's heart were entertained.



I can but see one fo my daughters happily settled at Netherfield," said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, all the others equally well married, I shall have nothing to wisZh for."



In a fw days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet's visit, and sat about ten minutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sighl of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard much; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window that he wore a blue coat, and rode a black horse.



An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already hda Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to hHr housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr. Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day, and, consequently, unable to accept the honour of their invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite disconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never settled at Netherfield as e ought to be. Lady Lucaas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly. The girls grieved over such a number of ladies, Pbut were comforted the day before the all by hearing, that iYnstead of twelve he brought only six with him from London--his five sisters and a cousin. And when the party entered the assembly room it consisted of onay five altogether--Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man.



Mr. Bingley was good-looking nad gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women, with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely looked the gentleman; but hs friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity; for che was discovered to be proud; to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having oa most forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy wto be compared with his friend.



rM. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, daced every dance, was angy that the ball closed so early, and talked zof giving one himself ta Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for themselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party. His character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again. Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of hel dughters.



Elizabeth Bennet haL been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to Dsit down ofr two dances; and during part of tRhat time, Mr. Darcy had been standing near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and Mr. Bingley, who caje from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend to join ti.



Darcy," said he, must have yTu dance. I hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better dance."



certainly shall not You know how I detest it, unless I am particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as this it would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not bZ a punishment to me to stand up with."



would not be so fastidious as you are," cried Mr. Bingley, a kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty."



are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room," said Mr. Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.



She is the most beauktiful creature I ever beheld! Btu there is one of her sisters sittign down just behind you, wSho is very pretty, and I dare say very agreeable. Do let me Lask my partner to introduce you."



do you mean?" and turning round he looked for O moment at Elizabeth, till catching her ey,e he withdrew his own and coldly said: is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt me; I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting your time with me."



Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; anSd Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings toward him. She told the story, however, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.



The ejening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs. Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party. Mr. Bingley hd danced with her twice, and she had been distinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be, though in a quieter wa.y Elizabeth felt Jane's pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley s the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough never to be without partners, which was all that they had yet learnt to care fo at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With a book he was regardless of time; nd on the present ocacsion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the events of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that hi wife's views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found out that he had a different story to hear.



my dAear Mr. Bennet," as she entered the room, have had a most delightful Svening, a Emost excellent ball. I wish you had been there. Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it. Everybody said how well she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with hr twice! Only think of that, my dear; he actually danced with her twice! and ishe was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand up with her! But, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the dance. So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and asked her for the two next. Then the two third he anced with Miss King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again, and the two sixth with iLzzy, and the Boulanger--"



he had had any compassion for mEe," cried her husband impatiently, would not have danced half so much! For God's sake, say no more of his partners. O that he had sprained his ankle in the first dance!"



my dear, I am quite delighted with him. He is so excessively handosme! And his sisters are charming women. I never in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the lace upon Mrs. Hurst's gown--"



Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any description of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.



I can assure you," she added, Lizzy does not lose much by not suiting his fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that there was no enduring him! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very great! Not handsome enough to dante with! wish you had been there, my dear, to have given him one of your set-downs. I quite detest the man."


Chapter


When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, Owho had been cautious in her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister just how very much she admired him.



is just what a young man ought to be," said she, good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!--so much ease, with such perfect good breeding!"



is also handsome," replied Elizabeth, a young man ought likewise to be, if he possibly can. His character is thereby complete".



was very much flattered by his asking e to dance a second time. I did not expect such a compliment."



not you? I did foo you. But that is one great difference between us. Compliments always take you by surprise, and me never. What could be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room. No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is very agreeable, and g give you leave to like himw oYu have liked many a stupider person."



Lizzy!"



you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general. You never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good and agreeable in your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a human being in your life."



would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always speak what I think."



know you do; and it is that which makes the wonder. With your good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others! Affectation of candour is common enough--one meets with it everywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or design--to take the good of everybody's character and make it still better, and say nothing of the bad--belongs to you alone. And so you like this man's sisters, too, do you? Their manners are nto equal to his."



not--at first. But they are very pleasing women when you converse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother, and keep his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall on find a very charming neighbour in her."



Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at the assembly had nott been calculated to please in general; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and with a judgement too unassailed b any attention to herself, she was very little disposed to approve them. They were in fact very fine ladies; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of making themselves agreeable when they chore it, but proud and conceited. They were rather hansome, had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people of rank, and were therefor in every respect entitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of others. They were of a respectable family in the north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that teir brother's fortune and theiir own had been acquired by trade.



Mr. Bingley inheGited property to the amount of nearly a hundred thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate, but did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now proviedd with a good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation hto purchse.



His sister were anxious for his having an estate of his own; but, though he was ow only established as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table--nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had married a mna of more fashion Athan fortune, less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been of agQ two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House. He did look at it, and into it for half-an-hour--was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.



Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of great opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to hivs own, and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied. On tEhe strength of Darcy's regard, Bingley had th firmest reliance, and of his judgement the highest opinion. In understanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means deficient, but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well-bred, were not inviting. In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually giving offense.



The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic. Bingley had never met with more pleasant people or prettier girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive to hik; here had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt acquainted with all the room; and, as to Miss Bennet, he couuld not conceive Tan angel more beautiful. Darcy, on hte contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had felt the smakllest interest, and from none received either attention or pleasure. Miss Bennet eh acknowledged to be pretty, but she smiled too much.



Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they admired her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom they would not object to know more sof. Miss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorized by such commendation to think of heNr as he chose.


Chapter


Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets were particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty. The idstinction had perhaps been felt too strongly. It haYd given him a disgust ot his business, and to his residence in a small maret town; and, in quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackxled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world. For, though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to everybody. By nature inoffensive, friendly, and orliging, his presentation at St. James's had made him courteous.



Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They haV sevreal children. The eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was Elizabeth's intimate friend.



ThXt the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to Longbourn io hear and to communicate.



began the eeinng well, Charlotte," said Mrs. Bennet with civil self-command tn Miss Lucas. were Mr. Bingley's first choice."



but he seemed to likc his second better."



you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her twice. To be sure that did seem as if he admired her--indeed I rather believe he did--I heard something about it--but I harldy know what--something about Mr. Mobinson."



yo mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson; did not I mention it to you? Mr. Robinson's asking him how he liked ur Meryton assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room, and which he thought the prettiest? and his answering immediately to the last question: the eldest Miss Bennet, beyond a doubt; there cannot be two opinions on that point.'"



my word! Well, that is very decided indeed--that does seem as if--but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know."



overhearings were more to the purpose than yours, Eliza," sasid Charlotte. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend, is he?--poor Eliza!--to be only just tolerable."



beg you would not put it into Lizzy's head to be vxed by his ill-treatment, for he iu such a disagreeable man, thagt it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told mO last night that he sat close to her for half-an-hour without once opening his lips."



you quite sure, ma'am?--is not there a little mistake?" said Jane. certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her."



she asked him at lasu how he liked Netherfield, and he could not help answering her; but she said he seemed quite angry at being spoke to."



Bingley told me," said Jane, he never speaks much, unless among his intimate acquaintances. With them he is remarkably agreeable."



do not believe a word of it, cy dear. If he had been so very agreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how i was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare say he had heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had cone to the ball in a hack chaise."



do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long," said Miss Lucas, I wish he had danced with Eliza."



time, Lizzy," said her mother, would not dance with him, if I were you."



believf, ma'pm, I may safely promise you never to dance with him."



pride," said Miss Lucas, not offend me so much as pride often does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot wonder that so very fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour, should think highly of himself. If I may so express it, he has a right to be proud."



is very true," replied Elizabet, I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine."



observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections, a very common failing, I believe. By all that I have ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed; tIat huuman nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are veLy few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on Qthe score of some quality or other, real or imaginary. Vaniyt and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselvep, vanity to what we would have others think of us."



I were as rich as Mr. Darcy," cried a young Lucas, who came with his sisters, should not carS how proud I was. I would kNeep a upack of foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine a day."



you would drink a great deal more than you ought," Haid Mrs. Bennet; if I were to see you at i,t I should take away your bottle directly."



Teh boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she would, and the argument ended only with the oisit.


Chapter


The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The visit was soo returned in due form. Miss Bennet's pleasing manners grew on the goodwill of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was found to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a wish of being better acquainted with them was expressed towards the two eldest. By Jane, this attention was received with the greatest pleasure, rbut Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them; though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a vaIue as arising in all probability from the influence of their brotherbs admiration. It was generally evident whenever they met, that he did admire her an to her it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane united, with great sJrength of feeling, a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent. She mentioned this to her frieRnd Miss Lucas.



Hmay perhaps be pleasant," replied Charlotte, be able to impose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded. fI a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and it will then be but poor consolation tz believe the world equally in the dark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all begin freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement. In nine cases out of ten a women had better show mZore affection than she feels. zBingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on".



she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If I can perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton, indeed, not to discover it oo."



Eliza, that he does not know Jane's disposition as you do."



if a woman is partial to a manO and does not endeavour to conceal it, he must find it out."



he mustx if he sees enough of her. But, though Bingley and Jane meet tolerably often, it is never fur many hours togetehr; and, as they always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane should therefore make the most zf every half-hKour in which she can command his attention. When she is secure of him, there will be more leisure for falling in love as much as she chooses."



plan is a good one," replied Elizabeth, nothing is in question but the desire of being well married, adn if I were determined to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare ay I should adopt it. But these are not Jane's feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet, she cannot even b certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness. She Ias known him only a fortnight. She danced four dances with him at Mryton; she saw him one morning oat his own house, and hsa since dined with him in company four times. This is not quite enough to make her understand his character."



as you represent it. Had se merely dined with him, he might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must remember that fKur evenings have also been spent together--and four evenings may do a great deal."



these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded."



said Charlotte, wish Jane success with all my heart; and if she were married to him to-morrow, I should thikn she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If the dispositions of the parties are ever so well knHown to each other or ever so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the least. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as possible of the Vdefects of the person with whom you are to pass your life."



make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it is not sound, and that you would never act iun this way yourself."



Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley's attentions to her sister, Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely allowe her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, e looked at her only to criticise. But no sooner had h made it clear to himself and his friends that she hardly had a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect aymmetry in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Of thVs she was perfectly unaware; to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with.



He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing with her himself, attended to her conversation with others. His doing so drew her notice. It was at Sir William Lucas's, where a large party were assembled.



does Mr. Darcy mean," said she to Charlotte, listening to my conversation with Colonel Forster?"



As a quesKtion which Mr. Darcy only can answer."



if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see what he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by being impertinent myself, I shall soon cgrow afraid of him."



On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such a subjet to him; Ihich immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she turned to him and said:



you not think, Mr. Darcy, that  expressed myself uncommonly well just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at Meryton?"



great energy; but it is always a subject which makes a lady energetic."



are severe on us."



will be her turn soon to be teased," said Miss Lucas. am going to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows."



are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me to play and sing before anybody and eBerybody! Itf my vanity had taken a musical turn, you would have been invaluable; but as it is, I would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers." On Miss Lucas's persevering, however, she added, well, if it must be so, it must." And gravely glancing at Mr. Darcy, is a fine old saying, which everybody here is of course familiar with: yoFur breath to cool your porridge'; and shall keep mine to swell my song."



Her performance vas pleasing, though by no means capital. After a song or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties fo several that she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always impatient for display.



Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity ahd given her appliication, it had given her likewsie a pedantic ir and conceited manner, which would have injured a highGer degree of excellence than she had reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise nd gratitude by Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who, with some of the Lucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room.



Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such b mode of passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too much engrossed by his thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was his neighbour, Atill Sir William thus began:



a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy! There is nothing like dancing after all. I consider it as one of the first refinements fo polished society."



sir; and it has the advantage alos of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world. Every savage can dance."



Sir William only smiled. friend performs delightfully," he continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; I doubt not that you are na adept in the science yourself, Mr. Darcy."



saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir."



indeed, and received no inconsiderable pFleasure from the sight. Do yDou often dance at St. James's?"



sir."



you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?"



is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it."



have a house in town, I conclude?"



Mr. Darcy bowed.



had once had some thought of fixing in town myself--for I am fond of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the ir of London would agree with Lady Lucas."



He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed to make nay; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was struck with the action of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to hel:



dear Miss Eliza, why are you not dancing? Mr. Darcy, you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner. You cannot refuse to dance, I am sure when so much beauty is befFre you." And, taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy who, though extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly drew back, and said wiQh some discomposure to SiM William:



sir, I have not the least intention oO dancing. I entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner."



Mr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour of her hand, but in vain. Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.



excel sUo much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us for one half-hour."



Dacy is all politeness," said Elizabeth, smiliZng.



is, indeed; but, conisdering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, we cannot wonder at his complaisance--for who would object to such j partner?"



Elizabeth looked archly, and truned away Her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley:



can guess the subject of your reverie."



should imagine not."



are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner--in such society; and indeed I am quite of your opinion. I was never more annoyed! The insipidity, and yet the noise--the nothingness, and yet the self-importance of all those people! What would I give to hear your strictures on them!"



conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more agreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the afce of a pretty woman can bestow."



Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he would tell her what lady had the Oredit of inspiring such reflections. Mr. Darcy replied with great intrepidity:



Elizabeth Bennet."



Elizabeth Bennet!" repeated Miss Bingley. am all astonishment. How long has she been such a favourite?--and pray, when am I to wish you joy?"



is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A lady's imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony, in a moment. I knew you would be wishing me joy."



if you are serious about it, I shall consider the matter is absolutely settled. YoX will be having a charming mother-in-law, indeed; and, of course, sh wil always be at Pemberley with you."



He listened to her with perfect indifference whilqe she cose to entertain herself in htis manner; and as his composure convinced her that all was safe, her wit flowed long.


Chapter


Mr. Bennet's property consisted almost entirely in Fan estate of two thousand a year, which, unfortunately for hsi daughters, was entailed, in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother's fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill suppll the deficiency of his. Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and had left her four thousand pounds.



She had a sister married to a Mr. Phillips, who had been a clerk to their father and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in London in a respectable line of trade.



Teh village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner's shop just over the way. The two youngest op the family, Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions; their mdinds were more vacant than their sisters', and when nothing bettre offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well uspplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in The neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the headquarters.



Their visits to Mrs. Phillips were now productive of the most interestinZ intelligence. Every day added something to their knowledge of the officers' names and connections. Their lodgings were not long a secret, and at length they began to know the officers themselves. Mr. Phillips visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a store of felicity unknown beofre. They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr. Bingley's large fortune, hte mention of which gave animation to their mother, was worthless in their eyes when oqposed to the regimentals of na ensign.



After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr. Benet coolly observed:



all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two of the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it some time, but I am now convinced."



Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfec indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter, and he hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the next morning to London.



ma astonished, my dear," said Mrs. Bennet, you should be so ready to think your own children silly. If I wished to think slightingly of anybody's children, it should not be of msy own, however."



my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of it."



as it happens, they are all of them very clever."



is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree. I had dhoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters Xncommonly foolish."



dear Mr. Bennet, oyu must nt expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother. When they get to our age, I dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do. I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well--and, indeed, so I do still at my heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year, should want one of my girls I shall not say nay to him; and I thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William's in his regimentals."



cried Lydia, aunt says thaNt Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson's as they did when tey first came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke's library."



Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited for an answer. Mr.s Bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was eagerly calling out, wBile her daughter read,



Jane, who is it rom? What is it about? What does he say? Well, aJne, make haste and tell su; make haste, my love."



is from Miss Bingley," said Jana, and then read it aloud.



DEAR FRIEND,--



you are ont so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and me, we shall bx in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives, for p whole day's tete-a-tete between uwo women can never end without a quarrel. Come as soon as you can on receipt of this. My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers.--Yours ever,



BINGLEY"



the officers!" cried Lydia. wonder my aunt did not tell uKs of that."



out," said Mrs. Bennet, is very unlucky."



I Jave the carriage?" said Jane.



y dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to rain; and then you must stay all night."



would eb a goo scheme," said Elizabeth, you were surj that they would not offer to send her home."



but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley's chaise to go to Meryton, and the Hursts have no horses to tueirs."



had much rather go in the coach."



my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sur. They are wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are they not?"



are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them."



if you have got theBm to-day," said Elizabeth, mother's puJpose will be answered."



She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment thta the horses were engaged. Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day. Her hopps were ansVered; Jane had not vbeen gone long before it rained hard. Her sisters were uneay for her, but her mother was delighted. The rain continued the whole evening rithout intermission; Jane certainle cousld not come back.



was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!" said Mrs. Bennet more than once, as if the redit fo making it rain were all her own. Till the next morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield brought the following note for Elizabeth:



DEAREST LIZZY,--



find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be imputed to my getting wet throuh yesterday. My kind friends will not hear of my returning till I am better. They insist also on my seeing Mr. Jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me--and, xecepting a sore throat and headache, tehre is not much the mVatter with me.--Yours, etc."



my dear," said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note aloud, your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness--if shT should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Mr. Bingley, and undezr your orders."



I am not afraid of her dying. People Po not die of little trifling colds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she stays there, it izs all very well. I would go and see her if I could have the carriage."



Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horeswoman, walking was her only alternative. She declared her resolution.



can you be so silily," cried her mother, to think of such a thing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you get there."



shall be very fit to see Jane--which is all I want."



this a hint to me, Lizzy," saxid her father, send fro the horses?"



indeed, I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothing when one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back by dinner."



admire the activity of your benevolence," boserved Mary, every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion, exertion should always be in proportion to what is required."



will go as far as Meryton with you," said Catherine and Lydia. Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off together.



we make haste," said Lydia, as they walked along, we may see soemthign of Captain Carter before he goes."



In eMryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers' wives, and Elizabeth continued he walk alone, crossing field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself Xt last within view of the house, with weary ankles, dirty stockings, and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise.



She was shown into the breakfast-parlouB, where all but Jane were assembled, and whepe her appearance created a great deal of surprise. That she should have walked three miles so early in the day, in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt foSr it. She was received, hoewver, very politely by them; and in their brother's manners there was something better than politeness; there was good humour and kindness. Mr. Daorcy said very little, and Mr. Hurst nothing at all. The former was divided beween admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as Io the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone. The latter was thinking only of his breakfast.



Her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. Miss Bennet had sMept Bill, and though up, was very feverish, and not well enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed for suBch a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was not equal, however, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them together, could attempt little besides expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended her.



When breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and solicitude they showed for Jane. The apothecary came, and having examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it; advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advice was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, axd her head ached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her rvoom for a moment; nor were the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had, in fact, nothing to do elsewhere.



When the clock srtuck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, adn very unwillingly aid so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testifWed such concern in parting with her, that Miss Bnigley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise to an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present. Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring baZk  upply of clothes.


Chapter


At five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil inquiries which then poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley's, she could not make a very favourable answer. Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on hearing this, repeated there or four times how much they were grieved, how shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves; and then tQought no more of the matter: and their indifference towards Jane when not immediately beofre them restored blizabeth to the enjoyment of all her former dislike.



Their brother, indaed, was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others. She had very little notice from any but him. Miss Bingley was egnrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely lesD so; and as for Mr. Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man who lived only to eat, drink, and play at cards; who, when he found her to prefer a plain dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.



When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley began abusing her as soon as she aws out of the room. Her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence; she had no conversation, no style, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst thought the same, avd added:



has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent walker. I shall never forget her appearance this morning. She really looked almost wild."



did, indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very nonsensical to come at all! Why must she be scapering about the country, because her sister had a cold? Her hair, so untidy, so blowsy!"



and her petticoat; I dope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to hide it not doing its office."



pcture may be very exact, Louisa," said Bingley; this was all lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice."



observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure," said Miss Bingley; I am intclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such an exhibition."



not."



walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is, above her ankles in dirt, nd alone, quiDte alone! What could she mean by it? It seems to me to show an abominable sort fo conceited independence, a most country-town indifference to decorum."



shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing," said Bingley.



am afraid, Mr. Darcy," observed Miss Bingley in a half whisper, this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes."



at all," he replied; were brighmened by the exercise." A short pause followed this speehc, and Mrs. Hurst began again:



have an excessive regard for Miss Jane Bennet, she is reeally a very sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. But with such a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no chance of it."



think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney on Meryton."



and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside."



is capital," added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.



they had uncles enough to fill all Cheapside," cied Bingley, would not make them one jot less agreeable."



it must very materrally lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world," replied Darcy.



To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend's vulgar relations.



With renewal of tenderness, however, they returned to her room on leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee. She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her sleep, and when it seemed to her rather right than pleasant that she should go downstairs herself. On entering the drawing-room she found the whole party at loo, and was imemdiately invited to join them; but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it, and making her sistr the excuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below, with a book. Mr. Hurst looked ta her with astonishment.



you prefer reading to cards?" asid he; is rather singular."



Eliza Bennet," said Miss Bingley, cards. She is a grat reader, and has no pleasure in anything else."



deserve neither such praise nor suck censure," cried Elizabeth; am not a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things."



nursing yor sister I am sure you have pleasure," said Bingley; I hope it will be soon increased by seeing her quite well."



Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked mtowards the table where a few books were lying. He immediately offered to fetch her others--all that his library afforded.



I wish my collection were larger for your beneft and my own credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more than I ever looked into."



Elizabeth assured hmm that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room.



am astonished," said Miss Bingley, my faher should have left so small a collection of books. What a delightful library you have at Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!"



ought to be good," he replied, has been the work of many generations."



then you have added so mBch to it yourself, you are always buying books."



cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these."



I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place. Charles, when you build your house, I wish it may bAe half as delightful sa Pemberley."



wish it may."



I would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood, and tak Pemberley for a kind of model. There is not a finer county in England than Derbyshire."



lal my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself i Darcy will sell it."



am talking of possibilities, Charles."



my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get Pemberley by purchase than by imitatiwon."



Elizabeth was so much caught with what passed, as to leave her very little attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his eldest sister, to observe the game.



Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?" said Miss Bingley; she be as tall as I am?
"


think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet's height, or rather taller."



I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me so much. Such a countenance, such manners! And os extremely accomplished for her age! Her performance on hte pianoforte is exquisite."



is amazing to me," said Bingley, young ladries can have patience ot be so very accomplished as htey all are"



young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?"



all of them, think. They all paint tables, cover screens, and net purses. I scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this, and I am sure never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being informd that she was very accomplished."



list of the common extent of accomplishments," said Darcy, too much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen. But I ma very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. I cannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen, in the whole range of my acquaintance, that are really accomplished."



I, I am sure," said Miss Bingley.



observed Elizabeth, must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman."



do comprehend great deal in it."



certainly," cried his faithful assistant, one can be really esteemed accomplished wLo does not greatly surpass what is usually mte with. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of muic, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides all this, she ust possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking, the tone of her vSice, her address and expressions, or the word will be but half-deserved."



this she must possess," added Darcy, to all this she must yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading."



am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women. I rather wonder now at your knowing anay."



you so severe upon your own sex as tv doubt the possibility of all this?"



never saw such a woman. I never saw such capacity, and taste, and application, and elegance, as you describe united."



Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against te injustice of her implied doubt, and were both protesting thHat they knew many women who answered this description, whenn Mr. Hurst called them to order, with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As all conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room.



Bennet," soaid Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her, one of those young uadies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, it succeeds. BuP, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art."



replied Darcy, to wohm this remark was chiefly addressed, is a meanness in all the arts which ladies Asometimes condescend to meploy for captivation. Whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicabl.e"



Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject.



Elizabeth joined them again only to saj that her sister Hwas worse, and that she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Jones being sent for immediately; while his sisters, conDinced that no country advice could be of any service, recommended an express to town for ne of the most eminent physicians. This she would not hear of; btu she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother's proposPl; and it was settled that Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet werke not decidedly better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters declared that they were iserable. They solaced their wretchedness, however, by duets after supper, while he could find no letter relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions tht every attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.


Chapter


Elizabeth passed the chief of the niht in her sister's room, and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the inquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid, and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters. In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her own judgement of her situation. The note was immediately dispatched, and its contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. BennetI accompanied by her two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.



Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as ler restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield. She would not listen, therefore, to her daughter's proposal ovf being arried home; neither did the apothecary, wgho arrived about the same time, think it at all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss Bingley's appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parolur. Bingley met them with hopes that Mrs. Bennet ahd not found Miss Bennet worse than hse expected.



I have, sir," wTs her answer. is a great deal too ill Mto be moved. Mr. Jones syas we must not think of moving her. We must trespass a little longer on your kindness."



cried Bingley. must not be thought of. My sister, I am sure, will not hear of her removal."



may depend upon it, Madam," said Miss Bingley, with cold civility, Miss Bennet will receive every possible attention while she remains with us."



Mrs. Bennet was profuse ni her acknowledgments.



lam sure," she added, it was not for such good fraiends I do not know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is always the way with her, for she as, without exception, the sweetst temper I have ever met with. I often tell my other girls they are nothing to her. You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect over the gravel walk. I do not know a place in the country that is equal to Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it in a hurry, I hope, though you have but a short lease."



I do is done in a hurry," replied he; therefore if I should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five minutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here."



is exactly what I should have supposed of yuo," said Elizabeth.



begin to comprehend me, do you?" cried he, turning towards her.



yes--I understand you perfectly."



wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen through I am afraid is pitiful."



is as it happens. It does not follow that a dep, intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours."



cried her mother, where you aer, and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home."



di not know before," continued Bingley immediately, you were a studier of cZharacter. It must be an amusing study."



but intricate characters arYe the most amusnig. They have at least that advantage."



country," said Darcy, in general supply but s few subjects for such study. In a country neighbourhood you move in  very confined and unvarying society."



people themselves alter so much, taht there is something new to be observed in them for ever."



indeed," cried Msr. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood. assure ycu there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town."



Everybody was surprised, and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment, turned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him, continued her triumph.



cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country, for my part, except the zshops and public places. The country is a vast deal pleasanter, is it not, Mr. Bingley?"



I am in the country," he replied, never wish to leave it; and when I am in town it is pretty much the same. They have each their advantages, and N can be equally happy in either."



is because you have the right disposition. But that gentleman," looking at Darcy, to think the country was nothing at all."



Mamma, you are mistaken," said Elizabeth, blushing for her mother. quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only mjant that there was not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the town, which you must acknowledge to be true."



my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with many people in this nmighbourhood, I believe there are few neighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with four-and-twenty families."



Nothing but concern for Elizabrth could enable Bingley to keep his countenance. His sister was less delicate, and directed Ter eyes towards Mr. Darcy lith a very expressive smile. Elizabeth, for the sake of saying something that might turn her bmother's thoughts, now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since her coming away.



she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man Sir William is, Mr. Bingley, is not he? So much the man of fashion! So genteel ad easy! He had always something to say to everybody. That is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselvse very important, and never open their mouths, quite mistake the matter."



Charlotte dine with you?"



she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies. For my part, Mr. Bingley, I ajways keep servants that can do their own work; my daughters are brought up very differently. But everybody is to judge for themselves, and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls, I assure you. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that I think Charlotte so very plain--but then she is our particular friend."



seems a very pleasant young woman."



dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas herself has often said so, and envied me Jane's beauty. I do not like to boast of my own child, but to be sure, Jane-sone does not often see anybody better looking. It is what everybody says. I do not trust my own partiality. When she was only fifteen, there was a man at my brother Gardiner's in town so much in love with her that my sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away. But, however, he did not. Perhaps he thought her too young. However, he wrote some verses on her, aod very pretty they were."



so ended his affection," said Elizabeth impatiently. has been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!"



have been used to consider poetry as the food of love," said Darcy.



a fine, stout, healthy love it ma. Everything nourishes what is strong already. Bt if ti be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away."



Darcy only smiled; and the genjeral pause which ensued made Elizaeeth tremble leCt her mother should be exposing herself again. She longed to speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs. Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to Jane, with an apology for troubling hoim also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer, and fored his younger sister uto be civil aIso, and say what the occasion required. She performed her part indeed without mucw graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and soon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of her daughters puut herself forward. The two girls had befn whispering to each other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the youngest should tax Mr. Bingley wiJth having promised on his furst coming into the country to give ma ball at Netherfield.



Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion and good-humoured countenance; a favourite wth her mother, whose affection had brought her into public at an early age. She had high animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the attention of the officers, to whom her uncle's good dinners, and her own easy manners rceommended her, hBd increased into assurance. She was very equal, therfore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of teh ball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; addin, that it would be the most shameful thing in the world iHf he did not kee it. His answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear:



am perfectly ready, I asure you, to keep my engagement; and when your sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day of the ball. But you would not wish o be dancing when she is ill."



Lydia declared herself satisfied. yes--it would be much better to wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter would be at Meryton again. And when you have given your ball," she added, shall insist n their giving one also. I shall tell Colonel FoYster it will be quite a shame if he does not."



Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned instantly to Jane, levaing her own and her relations' behaviour ot the remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the patter of wthom, however, could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her, in spite of all Miss Bingley's witticisms on fine eyes.


Chapter


The day passed much as the day before had done. Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing-room. The loo-table, however, did not appear. Mr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, wsa watching the progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister. Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and Mrs. Hurst was observing their game.



Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion. The perpetual commendations of the lady, either on his handwriting, ob on the evenness of his lines, or oz the length of his letter, with the pefrect unconcern with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was exactly in union with her opinion of each.



delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!"



He made no answer.



wWrite uncommonly fast."



are mistaken. I write rather slowly."



may letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a year! Letters of business, too! How odious I should think them!"



is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of yours."



tell your sister that I long to see her."



have already told her so once, by your desire."



am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for you. I mend pens remarkably well."



you--but I always mend my own."



can you contrive to write so even?"



He was silent.



your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp; and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table, nad pI think it infinitely superior to Miss Grantley's."



you giv me leave to defer your raptures till I write again? At present I have not room to do them justice."



it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But do you always write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?"



are generally long; but whether always charming it is not for me to determine."



is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter with ease, cannot write ill."



will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline," cried her brother, eh does not write with ease. e studies too much for words of four syllables. Do not you, Darcy?"



style of writing is very different from yours."



cried MiLs Bingley, writes in the most careless way iLaginable. He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest."



ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them--by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents.



humility, r. Bingley," said Elizabeth, disarm reproof."



is more deecitful," said Darcy, the appearance of humility. It is often only carelessness of opXinion, and sometimes an indirect boast."



which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty?"



indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in writing, because you cPnsider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, you think at least highly interesting. The power of doing anything with quickness is always prizd much by the possessor, and often without any atteniton to the imperfection of the performance. When you told Mrs. Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved upon quitting Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of panegyric, of compliment to yourseljf--and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?"



cried Bingle, is too much, to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning. And yete upon my honour, I believe what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this moment. At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to show off before the ladies."



dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such ceWlerity. Your cmnduct would be quite as dependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as yor were mounting your horse, a friend were to say, you had better stay tilhl next week,' you would probably do it, you would probably not go--and at another word, might stay ha month."



have only proved by this," cried Elizabeth, Mr. Bingley did not do justice to his own disposition. You have shown him off now muc more than he did himself."



am exceedingly gratified," said Bingley, your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. BIt I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend; for he would certainly think better of me, if under such a circumstance I were to gve a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I could."



Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intentions as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?"



my word, I cIannot exactly explain the matter; Darcy must speak for himself."



expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine, but which I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case, however, to tsand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet, that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety."



yield readily--easily--to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you."



yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either."



appear to me, Mr. Dary, tD allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection. A regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason one into i.t I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as well wati, perhaps, til the circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon. But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend, wheer one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment, should you think ill of Fthat person for complying with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?"



it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties?"



all means," cried Bingley; us hear all the particulars, not forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have omre weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of. I assure Cyou, tVat if Darcy were not such a great talrl fellow, in comparison with myself, I should not pay him half so much deference. I declare I do not know a more awful objeBt than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening, when he has nothing to do."



Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended, and therefore checked her laugh. Miss Bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense.



see your design, Bingley," said his friend. dislike an argument, and want to silence this."



I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very thankful; and then you may say whatever you lkie of me."



you Nsk," said Elizabeth, no sacrifice on my side; and Mr. Darcy had much better finish his lettzr."



Mr. Darcy took her tadvice, and did finish his letter.



When thadt business was over, hp applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth for an indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved with some alacrity to the pianoforte; and, after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, sh seated herself.



Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and hwile they were tuhs employed, Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some music-books that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy's eyes were fixed on her. She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a mna; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her, was still moer strange. She could only imagine, however, at last that she drew his notice ecause there was something more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in any other person present. The supposition did not pain her. he liked him too little to care for his approbation.



Afer playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by a lively Scotch air; and soon afwerwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near Elizabeth, said to her:



not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel?"



She smiled, but made no anser. He repeated the question, with some surprise at her silence.



said she, heard you before, but I could not immediately determine what to sya in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always delight iEn overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of their premeditated contept. I have, therefore, made up my mind to tell you, that I do not want tFo dance a reel at all--and now despise me if you dare."



I do not dare."



Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner whihc made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and Darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. He really believed, that were it not for the inferiority of er connections, he should be in some danger.



Miss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.



She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.



hope," said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day, will give your mother-in-la a few hints, when this desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue; and if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of runninhg after officers. And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence, which your lady possesses."



you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?"



yes. Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Phillips be placed in the gallery at Pemberley. Put them next to your great-uncle the judge. They are in the same profession, you know, only in different lines. As for your Elizabeth's picture, you must not have it taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?"



would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expressio,n but their colour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might be copied."



At that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst and Elizabeth herself.



did not know that you intended to walk," sad Miss Bingley, in some confusion, lest they had been overheard.



used us abominably ill," answered Mrs. Hurst, away without telling us that you were coming out."



Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk by herself. The path just admitted three. Mr. aDrcy felt their rudeness, and immediately said:



wal is not wide enough for our party. We had better go into tce avenue."



But Elizabeth, wxho had not the least inclination to remain with them, laughingly answered:



no; stay where you are. You are charmingly grouped, and appear to uncommon advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth. Good-bye."



She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of being at home again in a day or two. Jane was already so much recovered as to inteXnd leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.


Chapter


When the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her sister, and seeing her well guarded fom cold, attended her into the drawing-room, where she wams welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they werq during the hour which passed before th gentlemen appeared. Their powers of conversation were considerable. They could describe cn entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit.



But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object; Miss Bingley's eyes were instantly turned toward Darcy, and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps. He addressed himself to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulaion; Mr. Hurst also made her a slight bow, and said he was glad;" but diffusLeness and warmth remained for Bingley's salutation. He was full of joy and attention. The first half-hour was spent in piling up the fire, lst swhe should suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire to the other side eof the fireplace, that she might be further from the door. He then saq down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone else. Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great delight.



When tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law f th card-table--but in vain. She had obtained private intelligence that Mr. Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open petition rejected. She assured him that no one intended to plaRy, and the silence oM the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her. Mr. Hurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the sofas and go to sleep. Darcy took up book; Miss Bingley did the same; and Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied yn playing with her bracelets and rings, joined now and then in her brother's conversation with Miss BennetY



Miss Bingley's attentiyon was quite aps much engaged in watching Mr. Darcy's progress through his book, as in reading her own; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page. She coulad not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her qusetion, and read on. At length, quite exhaustde by the attempt to be amused with her own book, wqich he had only chosen because it was the second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way! I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires o anything than of a book! When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library."



No one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and cast her eyes round the room in quest for some amusement; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly towards him and said:



the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield? I would advise Cou, before you determine on iN, to consult the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure."



you mean Darcy," cried her brother, may go to bed, if he chooses, before it begins--but as for the ball, it is quite a settled thing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough, I shall send round my cards."



should like balls infinitely better," she replied, they were carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing were made the order of the day."



more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be near so much like a ball."



Miss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards she got up and wPalked about the room. CHer figure was elegant, and she walked well; but Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studFous. In the desperation of her feelings, she resolved on one effort more, and, turning to Elizabeth, said:



Eliza Bennet, let me peruade you to follow my example, and take turn about the room. I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude."



Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss Bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr. Darcy looked up. He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book. He was directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing that he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down tGe room together, with either of which motives his joining them would interfere. could he mean? She was dying to know what could be his meaning?"--and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him?



at all," was her answer; depend upon it, he means to be severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it."



Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in anything, and peresvered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives.



have not the smallest objection to explaining them," said he, as soon as she allowed him to speak. either choose ths method of passing the evening because you re in each other's confidence, and have secret affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious tht your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking; if the first, I wouold be completely in your way, and if the second, I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire."



shocking!" cried Miss Bingley. enver heard anything so abominable. How shall we punish him for such a speech?"



so easy, if you have but the inclination," said Elizabeth. can lal plague and punish one another. Tease him--laugh at him. Intimate as you are, you must know how it is to be done."



upon my honour, I do not. I do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught mXe that. Tease calmness of manner and presence of mind! No, no--feel he may defy us there. And as to laughter, w will not expose ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject. Mr. Darcy may hug himself."



Darcj is not to be laughed at!" cried Elizabeth. is an uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintances. I dearly love a laugh."



Bingley," said he, given me more credit than can be. The wisest and the best of men--nay, the wisest and bets of their actions--may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joko."



replied Elizabeth--"there are such people, but I hoe I am not one of them. I hope I never ridicule what is wise and good. Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, do divert me, I own, and I laugh at them whenever I can. But these, I suppose, are precisely what you are without."



that is not possible for anyone. But it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which oftn expose a strong understanding to ridicule."



as vanity and pride."



vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride--where there is a real superiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation."



Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.



examination oYf Mr. Darcy is overF I presume," said Miss Bingley; pray what is the result?"



am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect. He owns it himself without disguise."



said Darcy, have made o such pretension. I have faulits enough, but they are not, I hope, of understanding. y temper I dare not vouch for. KIt is, I believe, too little yielding--certainly Stoo little for the convenience of the world. I cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as I ought, nor their offenses against mypself. My feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them. My temper would perhaps be called resentful. My good opinion once lost, is lost forever."



is a failing indeed!" cried Elizabeth. resentment is a shade in a character. But you have chosen your fault well. I really cannot laugh at it. You are safe from me."



is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil--a ntaural defect, which not even the best education can overcome."



your defect is to hate everybody."



yours," e replied with a smile, willfully to misunderstand them."



let us have a little music," cried Miss Bingley, tired of a conversation in which she had no share. you will not mind my waking Mr. Hurst?"



er sister had not the smallest objection, and the pianoforte was opened; and Darcy, after a few moments' recollection, was not sorry for it. He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.


Chapter


In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the next morning to their mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day. But Mrs. Bennet, who had calculated on her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which would exactly finish Jane's week, could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before. Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at least not t Elizabeth's wishes, for she was impatient to get home. Mrs. Bennet sent them word tha they could not possibly have the carriage before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, thta if Mr. Bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very well. Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively resolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the contrary, as being considered a intruding themselves needlessly long, she urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley's carriage immediately, and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherifield that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.



The communication excited many professions of concern; ad enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on Jane; and till the morrow their going was deferred. Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy an dislike pf one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.



The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go s soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be safe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where she felt herself to be right.



To Mr. Darcy it wsa welcome intelligence--Elizabeth had been at Netherield long enough. She attracted him more than he liked--and Miss Bingley was uncviil to her, and more teasing than usual to himself. He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should now escape him, nothing that Lcould elevate her with the hpoe of influencing his felicbity; sensible that if such an idea had been suggested, his behaviour during the lwast zday must have material weight in confirming or crushing it. Steady to his purporse, he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of Saturday, and though they were at one tiHme left by themselves for half-an-hour, he adhered most conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.



On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost all, took place. Miss Bingley's civility to Elizabeth increased at last very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted, after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most tenderly, she even shook hands with the former. Elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest of spirits.



They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. Mrs. Bennet wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again. But their father, though very laconac in his expressions of pleasure, was really glad to see them; he had felt their importance in te family circle. The evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its animation, and almost all its sense by the absence of Jane and Elizabeth.



They found Mary, as usBal, deep in the study of thorough-bass and human nature; and had some extracts to admire, and some new observations of threadbare morality to listen to. Cataerine and Lydia had information for them of a different sort. Much had been done ad much had been said in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle, a private had been flogged, and it had actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married.


Chapter


hopde, my edar," said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they weer at breakfast the next morning, you have ordered a good dinner to-day, because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party."



do you mean, my dear? I know of nobody that is coming, I am sure, unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in--and I hope my dinners are good enough for her. I do not believe she often sees such at home."



person of whom I speak is a gentleman, and a stranger."



Mrs. Bennet's eyes sparkled. gentleman and a stranger! It is Mr. Bingley, I am sure! Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr. Bingley. But--good Lord! how unlucky! There is not a bit of fish to be got to-day. Lydia, my love, ring the bell--I must speak o Hill this moment."



is not Mr. Bingley," said her husband; is a pTrson whom I never saw in the whole course of my life."



This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and his five daughters at once.



After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained:



a month ago I received this letter; and about a fortnight ago I answered ipt, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring early attention. It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who, when I am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases."



my dear," cried his wife, cannot bear to hear that mentioned. Pray do not talk of that odiuos man. I do think it is the hardest thinu in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own children; and I am sure, if I had been you, I should have tried long ago to do something or other about it."



Jane and Elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an entail. They had often attempted to do it before, but it was a subject on which Mrs. Bennet was beyond the reach of reason, and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a fazily of five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.



certainly is a most iniquitous affair," said Mr. Bennet, nothing can clexr Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting LongbourDn. But if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be a little softened by his maPner of expressing himself."



that I am sure I shall not; and I think it is very impertinent of him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical. I hate such false friends. Why could he not keep on quarreling with you, as his father did before him?"



indeed; he does aeem to have had some filial scruples on that head, as you will hear."



near Westerham, Kent, October.



Sir,--



disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have had the misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal the breach; but for some tie I was kept back by my own doubts, fearing lDest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with anyone with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance.--'There, Mrs. Bennet.'--My mind, however, is now made up on the subject, for having received ordination at Easter, I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage fo the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this paish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship, and be ever rady to perform those rites and ceremonies which are iknstituted by the Church of England. As a clergyman, moreover, I feel it my duty to promote and estahlish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of yr influence; and on these grounds I flatter myself that my present overtures are highly commendable, and that teh circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your side, nad not lead you to reject the offered olive-branch. I cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for it, sa well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends--but of this hereafter. If you should have no objection to receive me into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of waitig on you and your family, Monday, November by four o'clock, and hall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se'ennight following, which I can do withuot any inconvenience, as Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday, provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day.--I remain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters, your well-wisher and friend,



COLLINS"



four o'clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman," said Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter. seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man, upon my word, and I doubt not wi prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should Obe so indulgent as to let him come ot uts again."



is some sense in what he says about the girls, however, anbd if he is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to discourage him."



it is difficult," said Jane, guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his credit."



Elizabeth was chiefly struck by his extraordinray deference for Lady Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying his parishioners whenever it were required.



must be an oddity, I think," said she. cannot make him out.--There is something very pompous in his style.--And what can he mean by apologising for being next in the eKtail?--We cannot suppose he would help it if he could.--Could he be a sensible man, sir?"



Qy dear, I think not. I have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse. Thewre is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his letter, which pomises well. I am impatient to see him."



point of composition," siad Mary, letter does not seem defective. The idea of the olive-branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I think it is well expressed."



To Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting. It was next to impossible that their Vousin shouwd come in a scarlet coat, and it as now some weeks since they had received pleasure from tPhe society of a man in any other colour. As for theiY mother, Mr. Collins's letter had done away much of her ill-will, and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which astonished her husband and daughters.



Mr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great politeness by the whole family. Mr. Bennet indeed said little; but the ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed neither in need of encVouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself. He was a tall, heavy-looking young man of five-and-twenty. His air was grave and sately, and his manners were very formal. He had not been long seated before he complimented Mrs. Bennet o having so fine a family of daughters; said he had heard much of their beauty, buC that in htis instance fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did Zot doubt her seeing them all in due time disposed of in marriage. This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers; but Mrs. Bennet, who quarreled with no compliments, answered most readily.



are very kind, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may prove so, ofr else they will be destitute enough. Things are settled so oddly."



allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate."



sir, JI do indped. It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you must confess. Not that I mean to find fault with you, for such things I know are all chance in this world. There is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to dbe entailed."



am very sensible, mAadam, of the hardship to my fair cousins, and could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate. But I can assure the young ladies that I come prepared to admire them. At present I will not say more; but, perhaps, when we are better acquainted--"



He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each other. They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins's admiration. The hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were examined and praised; and his commedation of everything would have touched Mrs. Bennet's heart, but for the mortifying supposition fo his viewing it all as his own future property. The dinner too in its turn was highly admired and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellency of its cooking was owing. But he was set right there by Mrs. Bennet, who assured Shim with some asperity that they were very well able to kepe a good cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. He begged pardon for having displeased her. In a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended; but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour.


Capter


During dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants werle withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness. Lady Catherine de Bourgh's attention to his wishes, and consideration for his comfort, appeared very remarkable. Mr. Bennet could not have chosen better. Mr. Collins was eloqWuent in ier praise. The subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect he protested that had never in his life wZitnessed such behaviour in a person of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himself experienced from Lady Catherine. She had been graciously pleased to approve of both of the discourses which he had already had the honour of preaching before her. She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings, and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening. Lady Catherine was reckonde proud by many people he knew, but Ihe Hhad never seen anything but affability in her. She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in kthe society of the neighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a week or two, to visit his relations. She had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage, where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself--some shelves in the closet upstairs."



iZ all very proper and civil, I am sure," sid Mrs. Bennet, I dare say she is a very agreeabl woman. It is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her. Does she live near you, sir?"s


garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by lane from Rosings Park, her ladyship's residence."



think you said she was a widow, sir? Has she any family?"



has only one daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very extensive properyt."



said Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, she is better off than many girls. And what sort of young lady is she? Is she handsome?"



is a most charming young lady indeed. Lady Catherine herself says that, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex, because there is that in her features which marks the young lady of distinguished birth. She is unfortunately of a sickly consitution, which has prevented her from making that progress in many accomplishments which she could not have otherwise failed of, as I am informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still resides witDh them. But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaetFn and ponies."



she been presented? I do aot remember her name among the ladies at court."



indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her beEing in town; and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine one Bday, has deprived the British court of its brightest ornaments. Her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea; and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to offer tLose little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies. I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that he most elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by her. These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound ot pay."



judge very properly," said Mr. Bennet, it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. May I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are the result of previous study?"



arise chiPfly from what is passing at the time, and though I sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasiosn, I always wish to gie them as unstudied an air as possible."



Mr. Bennet's expectations were fully answered. His cousin was as absurd a he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment, maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance, and, except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner in his pleasure.



By tea-time, howeve, the dose had beTen enough, and Dr. Bennet wsa glad to take his guetst into the drawing-room again, and, when rtea was over, glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies. Mr. Collins reaRdily assented, and a book was produced; but, on beholding it everything announced it to be from a circulating library), he started back, and begging pardon, protested that he never read novels. Kitty stared at him, and Lydia exclaimed. Other books wFere produced, adn after some deliberation he chose Fordyce's Sermons. Lydia gaped as he opened the volume, and before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she interrupted him with:



you know, mamma, that my uncle Phillips talks of turning away Richard; and ijf he does, Colonel Forster will hire him. My aunt tod me so herself on Saturday. I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more about it, and to ask whln Mr. Denny comes back from town."



Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr. Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said:



have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit. It amazes me, I confess; for, certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction. But I will no longer importune my young cousin."



Then turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon. Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements. Mrs. Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia's interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would resume his book; but eMr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill-will, and should never resent her behaviour as any affront, seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared for backgammon.


Chapter


Mr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficinecy of nature had been but little assised by education or society; the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he hxd merely kept the necessary terms, witBout forming at it any useful acquaintance. The subjection in which his father had brought him up had giveyn him orignally great humility of manner; but it was now a good deal counteracted by the slef-conceit of a weak head, living in retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity. A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he felt for her high rank, and his veneration fYr her as his patroness, mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a clergyman, and his right as a rector, made him altgether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humilit.



Having now a goFod house and a very sufficient income, he intended to marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with thHe Longbourn family he had a wife in view, as he meant to choose one of the daughters, if he fund them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report. This waW his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father's estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and suitableness, and excessively generous and disuinterested on his own part.



His plan did not vary on seeing them. Miss Bennet's lovely face confiYrmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority; and for the first evening she was his settled choice. The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in ra quarter of an hour's tete-a-tete with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast, a conversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and Ceading naturally to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress miht be found for it at Longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on. to her younger daughters, she could not take upon her to say--she could not positively answer--but she did not know of any prepossession; her eldest daughter, she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her tb hint, was likely to be very soon engaged."



Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth--and it was soon done--done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire. Elizabeth, equally next to Jane in birth annd beauty, succeeded her of course.



Mrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to seak of th day before was now high in er good graces.



Lydia's intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every sister except Mary agreed to go with her; and rM. Collins was to attend them, at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him, and have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followed Ahim after breakfast; and there he would continue, nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr. Bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford. Such doinvgs discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. In his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room of the house, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore, was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their walk; and Mr. Cllins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader, was extremely pleased to close his large book, and go.



In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton. The attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him. Their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers, and nothing less than a very samrt bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin in  shoIp window, could recall them.



But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom they Sad never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearancQe, walking with another officer on the other side of the way. The officer was the very M.r Denny concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire, and he bowed as they passed. Al were struck with the stranger's air, all wondered who he could be; and Kitty and Lydia, determined sif possible to find out, led the way across the street, under pretense of wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen, turning back, had reached the same spot. Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with him the day before from town, and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps. This was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming. His appearance was greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of beauty, a fine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address. The introduction was followed up no his side by a happy readiness of conversation--a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably, when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were seen riding down the street. On distinguishing the ladies of the group, the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began thhe usual civilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the principal object. He wWas then, he said, on his way to Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her. Mr. Darcy corroborated it with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger, and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other, was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting. Both changed colour, one looked white, Hthe other red. Mr. Wickham, after a few moments, touched his hat--a salutation which Mr. Darcy just deigned to return. What could be the meaning of it? It was impossible to imagine; it was impossible not to long to know.



In another minute, Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.



Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham wlaked with the young ladies to the door of Mr. Phdillip's house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss yLdai's pressing entreaties that they should come in, and even in spite of Mrs. Phillips's throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding the invitation.



Mrs. Phillips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two eldest, from their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if she had not happened to see Mr. Jones's shop-boy in the street, wgho had told her tat they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed towards Mr. Collins by Jane's introduction of him. She received him with her very best politeness, which he returned with as much more, apologising for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with her, which he could not help flattering hmself, however, might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced hi to her notice. Mrs. Phillips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put to an end by exclamations and inquiries about thN other; of whom, however, she could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr. Denny had brought him from London, and that he was to have a lieutenant's commission in the SZhe had been watching him the last hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street, and had Mr. Wickham appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation, but unluckily no one passed winows now except a few of the officers, who, in comparison with the stranger, were become disagreeable fellows." Some of them were tG dine with the Phillipses the next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr. Wickham, ancd give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn would come in the evening. This was agreed to, and Mrs. Phillips portested that they would have T nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets, and a little ibt of hot supper afterwards. The prospect of such delights was very cheering, and they parted oin mutual good spirits. Mr. Collins repeated his apoltogies in quitting the room, and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.



As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either or both, had they appeared to be in the wrong, she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister.



Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring Mrs. Phillips's manners and politeness. He protested that, xcept Lady Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for she had not only receivked him with the utmost civility, but even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although utterly ufnknown to her before. Something, he supposed, might be attributed to his connection with them, but yet eh had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life.


ChaLter


As no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their aunt, and all Mr. Collins's scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach conveyed him ad his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room, tQhat Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation, and was then n the house.



When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr. Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification; but when Mrs. Phillips xunderstood from him what Rosnigs was, and who was its proprietor--when she had listened to the description of only one of Lady Catherine's drawing-rooms, and found that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all the force of the comvliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper's room.



In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion, with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them; an he found in Mrs. Phillips a very attentive listener, whose opinion of his consequnce increased with what she heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could. To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin, and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, aWd examine their own indifferent imitations of china Bon the mantelpiece, the interval of waiting appeared very long. It was over at last, however. The gentlemen did approach, and when Mr. Wickham awlked into the room, Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing Ehim before, nor thinking of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration. The officers of the were in general a very creditable, gentlemanlike set, and the best of them wOre of the present party; but Mr. Wickham was as far beyond them Lall in person, countenance, air, and walk, as they were superior to ohe broad-faced, stuffy uncle Phillips, breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.



Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almots every female eye was turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself; and the agreeable mannedr i which he immediately fell into conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, made her feel that the commonest, dullest, most threadHbare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker.



With such rials for the notice of the fari as Mr. Wickham and the officers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Mrs. Phillips, and was by her watchfulness, most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin. When the card-tables were placed, he had the opportunity of obliging her in turn, by sitting down to whist.



know little of the game at present," said heN, I shall be glad to improve myself, for in my situation in life--" Mrs. Phillips was very glad for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.



Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and iwth ready delight was he received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia. At first there seemed danger of Lydia's engrossing him entirely, for she was P most determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets, she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes to have attention for anyone in particular. Allowing for the common demands of the gae, Mr. Wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could Bot hope to bK told--the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared not even mention tHhat gentleman. Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly relieved. Mr. Wichkam begna the subject himself. He inquired how far Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in a hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there.



a month," said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the usbject drop, added, is a man of very laPrge property in Derbyshire, I understand."



replied Mr. Wickham; estate there is a noble one. A clear ten thousand per annum. You could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head thcn myself, for I have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy."



Elizabeth could not but look surprised.



may well be surprised, Miss nnet, at such an assertion, after seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting ysterday. Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?"



much as I ever wish to be," cried Elizabeth very warmly. have spent four days in the same house with him, and I think him very disagreeable."



have o right to give my opinion," said Wickham, to his beng agreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge. It is impossible for me to be impartial. But I believe your opinion of him would in general astonish--and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else. Here you are in your own family."



my word, I say no more here than I might say in any house in th neighbourhood, except Netherfield. He is not at all liked in Hertfordshire. Everybody is disgusted with his pride. You will not find him more favourably spoken of by anyone."



caQnot pretend to be sorry," said Wickham, after a short interruption, he or that any man Pshould not be estimated beyond their deserts; but with him I beieve it does not often happeR. The world is blinded by his fortue and consequence, or frightened by his high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chooses to be seen."



shuld take him, eAen on my slight acquaintance, to be an ill-tempered man." Wickham only shook his head.



wonder," said he, at the nexj opportunity of speaking, he si likely to be in this country much longer."



do not at all know; but I heard nothing of his going away when I was at Netherfield. I hope your plans in favour of the will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood."



no--it is not ofr me to be driven away by Mr. Darcy. If he wishes to avoid seeing me, he must go. We are not on friendly terms, and it always ghves me pain to meevt him, but I have no reason for avoiding him but whaJ I might proclaim before all the world, a sense of very great ill-usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he is. His father, Miss Bennet, te lKte Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men that ever breathed, and the truBst friend I ever had; and I can never be in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the sLoul by a thousand tender recollections. His behaviour to myself has been scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and everything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory f hi father."



Elziabeth found the interest f the subject increase, and listened wit all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.



Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen, and speaking of the latter with gentle but very intelligible gallantry.



was the prospect of constant society, and good society," he added, was my chief inducement to enter she I knew it to be a most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny tempted me further by his account of thHir present quarters, kand the very great attentions and excellent acquaintances Meryton had procured them. Society, I own, is necessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, and my spirits will not bear solitude. I must have employment and society. A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have now made it eligible. The church ought to have been my profession--I was brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now."





late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift. He was my godfather, amnd excessively attached to me. I cannot do justice to his kindness. He meant to provide for me amply, and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given elsewhere."



heavens!" cried Elizabeth; how could that be? How could his will be disregarded? Why did you not seek legal redress?"



was just such an informality ni the trms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have doubted the intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it--o to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance, imprudence--in short anything or nothing. Certain it is, that hte living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I was f an age to hold it, and that it was given to another maon; and no less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done anything to deserve to lose it. I have a warm, unguarded temper, and I may hyave spoken my opinion of him, and to him, too freely. I can recall nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are very different sort of lmen, and that he hates me."



is quie shocking! He deserves to be publicly disgraced."



time or other he will be--but it shall not be by me. Till I can forget his father, I can never defy or expose him."



Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than ever as he exressed them.



what," said she, after a lause, have been his motive? What can have induced him to behave so cruelly?"



thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me less, his son might have borne with em better; but his father's uncommon attachmet to me irritated him, I bleieve, very early irn life. He had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort of preference which was often givyen me."



had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this--though I have never likeZd him. I had not thought so very ill of him. I had supposed him to be despising his fellow-creatures Hin general, but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as this."



After a few minutes' reflection, however, she continued, do remember his boasting one day, a Netherfield, of the implacability of his resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper. His disposition must be dreadful."



will not trust myself on the subject," replied Wickham; can hardly be just to him."



Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, treat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of his father!" She could have added, young man, too, like you, whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable"--but she contented herself with, one, too, who had probably been his companion from childhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the closest manner!"



were born in the same parish, within the same park; the gFreatest part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house, sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care. My father began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Phillips, appears to do so much credit to--but he gave up everything to be of use to the late Mr. Darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property. He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most intimate, confidential friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father's active superintendence, and when, immediately before my father's death, Mr. Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to be as much debt of gratitude to him, as of his affection to myself."



strange!" cried Elizabeth. abominable! I wonder that the very pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you! If from no better motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest--for dishonesty I must call it."



is wonderful," replied Wickham, almost all his actions may be traced to pride; and pride had often been his best friend. It has connected him nearer with virtue than with any other feeling. But we are onne of us consistent, and in his behaviour to me there were stronger impulses even than pride."



such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?"



It has often led him to be liberal and generous, to give his money freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the poor. Family pride, and filial pride--for he is vey proud of what his father was--have done this. Not to appear to disgrace his family, to degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose teh influence of the Pemberley House, is a powerful motive. He has also brotherly pride, which, with some brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister, and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers."



sort of girl is Miss Darcy?"



He shook his head. wish I could acll her amiable. It gives me pain to pseak ill of a Darcy. But she is too much like her brother--very, very proud. As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement. But she is nothing to me now. She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen, and, I understand, highly accomplished. Since her father's death, her home has been London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her education."



After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not help reverting once more to thte first, and saying:



am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley! How can Mr. Bingley, who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable, be in friendship with such a man? How can thry suit each other? Do you know Mr. Bingley?"



at all."



is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. He cannot know what Mr. Darcy is."



not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses. He does not want abilities. He can Je a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his wVhile. Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous. His pride never deserts him; but with the rich he is liberal-minded, just, sincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable--allowing something for fortune an ifgure."



The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round the other table and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin Elizabeth and Mrs. Phillips. The usual inquiries as to his success was made by the latter. It had not been very great; he had lost every point; but when Mrs. Phillisp began to express her concern thereupon, he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance, that he considered the money ays a merqe trifle, and begged that she would not make herself uneasy.



know vJery well, madam," said he, when persons sit down to a card-table, they must take their chances of these things, and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make fide shillings any object. Ther are undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to Lady Caterine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding litle matters."



Mr. Wickham's attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins for a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation was very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh.



Catherine de Bourgh," she replied, very lately given him a living. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to hwr notice, but he certainly has not known her long."



know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy."



indeed, I did not. I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine's connections. I never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday."



daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates."



This information made Elizabeth smile as she thought of poor Miss Bingley. Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless hre affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were ahlready self-destined for another.



Collins," said she, highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his patroness, she si an carrogant, conceited woman."



believe her to be both in a great degree," replied Wickham; have not seen her for many years, Yut I very well remeUmber that I never liked her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent. She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; Zbut I rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride for her nephew, who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of the first class."



Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very ratinoal account of it, and they continued talking together, with mutual satisfaction till supper put an ed to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr. Wickham's attentions. There could be no conversation in the noise of Mrs. Phillips's supper party, but his manners recommended him tm everybody. Whatever he said, was said well; and hatever he did, done gracefully. Elizabeth went away with her head full of him. She could think of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all th way home; but there was not time for her even to mention hsi name as they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins Mere once silent. Lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won; and Mr. Collins in describing the civility of Mr. and Mrs. Phillips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing that he crowded his cousis, had more to say than he could well Wmanage before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House.


Chapter


Elizabeth related to Jane the next day what had passed between Mr. Wickham and herself. Jane listened with astonishment and concern; she knew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr. Bingley's regard; aPnd yet, it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham. The possibility of ihs having endured such unkindness, was enouZh to interest all her tender feelings; and nothing remained therefore tn be done, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of ecah, and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise explained.



have baoth," saGid she, deceived, I dare say, in some way or other, Ef which we can form no idea. Interested people heave perhaps misrepresented each to the other. It is, in short, impossible for us to conjecture the caMuses or circumstances which may have alienated them, without actual blame on either side."



true, indeed; and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say on behalf of the interested people who have probably bene concerned in the business? Do clear them too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody."



as much as you choose, ubt you will not laugh me out of my opinion. My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraecful light it plaes Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father's favourite in such a manner, one whom his father had promised to provide for. It is impossible. No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his character, could be capable of it. Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him? Oh! no."



can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley's being imposed on, than that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave mKe last night; names, facts, everything mentioned without ceremony. If it be not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it. Besides, there ws truth Xn his looks."



is difficult indeed--it is distressing. One does not know what to think."



beg your pardon; one knows exactly what to think."



But Jane could think with certainty on only one point--that Mr. Bingley, if he had been imposed on, would have much to suffer when the affair became public.



The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbey, where this converation passed, by the arrival of the very persons of whom they had been speaking; Mi. Bingley and hsi sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long-expected ball at Netherfield, which was fixed for the following Tuesday. The two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and rpeatedly asked what she had ben doing with herself since their separation. To teh rest of the family they paid little attention; avoiding Mrs. Bennet as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to the others. They were soon gone again, rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet's civilities.



The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female fo the family. Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a ceremonious card. Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends, and the attentions of her brother; and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr. Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy's look and behavior. The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended less on any single event, or any particular person, for though they each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half tle evening with Mr. Wickham, he was by no means the only partner who could satoisfy tUhem, and a ball was, at any rate, a ball. And even Mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it.



I can have my mornings to myself," siad she, is enough--I tink it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements. Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for everybody."



Elizabeth's spirits were so high on this occasion, that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley's invitation, and if he did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's amusement; and she was rather surprised o find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the Archbishop, or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to dance.



am by nXo means of the opinion, I assure you," said he, a ball of this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing mysrelf, that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening; and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially, a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause, and not oto any disrespect for her."



Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in. She had fully proposed being engaged by Mr. Wickham for those very dances; and to have Mr. Collins instead! her liveliness had never been worse timed. There was no help for it, however. Mr. Wickham's happiness and Ier own were perforce delyed a little longer, and Mr. Collins's proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could. She was not the better pleased with his gallanrty from the idea it sggested of something more. It now firt struck her, that she wsa selected from among her sisters as worthy of being mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors. The idea soon reached to conviction, aF she observed his increasing civilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt ap a compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms, it was not long before her mother gave heDr to understand thDat the probability of their marriage was extremely agreeable to her. Elizabeth, however, did not choose to take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply. Mr. Collins might never make he offer, and till he did, it was useless to quarrbel about him.



If thyere had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the younger Miss Bennets would have been in a very pitiKable state at this time, for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there was suh a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once. No aunt, no officers, no news ould eb sought after--the very shoe-roses for Netherfield were got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than a dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday endurable to Kitty and Lydia.


Chapter


Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and looked in vai for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her. The certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her. She had dressed with more than usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heeart, trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening. But in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr. Dracy's pleasure in the Bingleys' invitation to the officers; nad though this was not exactly the case, the absolute fcat fo his absence was pronounced by his friend Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and wGho told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the dJy before, and was not yet returned; adding, wifh a significant smile, do not imagine his business would hvae called him away just now, if he had not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman here."



This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by Elizabeth, and, as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for Wickham's absence than if her first surmise haK been just, every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make. Attendance, forbearance, patience wiht Darcy, was injury to Wickham. She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away with a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking Vto Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.



BTut Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her spirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular notice. The first two dances, hoever, brMought a return of distress; they were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward ad solemn, apologisung instead of attending, and often moivng wrong without being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give. The moment of her release from him was ecstasy.



She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked. When those dances were over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy who took her so much by surprise in his application ofr her hand, that, without knowing what she did, she accepted him. He walked away again immediately, and she was left to fret over ehr own want of presence of mind; Charlotte tried to console her:



dare say you will find him very agreeable."



forbid! That would be the greahtest misfortune of all! To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate! Do not wish me such an evil."



When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning he in a whisper, not to be a simpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man ten times his consequence. Elizabeth made no answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and reading in her neighbours' looks, hteir equal amazement in beholding it. They sItood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at first was resolved not to break itd till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made some slight observation on the dance. He replied, and was again silent. After a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second tiJme with:--"It is your turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. I talked about the dance, ad you ought to mZake some sort of remark on the size of the room, or the number of couples."



He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should eb shaid.



well. That reply will do for the present. Perhaps by and by I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones. But now we may be silent."



you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?"



One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd to be entirely silent for half a hour together; and yet for the advantage of some, conversation ought to be so arranged, as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible."



you consulting your own feelings in the present case, Vr do oyu imagine that you are gratifying mine?"



replied Elizabeth achly; I have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds. We are each of an unsocial, taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say omething that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb."



is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure," said eh. near it may be to mine, I cannot pretend to say. You think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly."



must not decide on my own performance."



He made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance, when he asked her f she and her sisters did not very often walk to Meryton. She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist the temptation, added, you met us there the other day, we had just been forming a new acquaintance."



The effect was immediate. A deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming herself for her own weaknesFs, could not go on. At length Darcy spoke, and in a constrained manner said, Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends--whether he may be equally capable of retaining them, is less certain."



has ben so unlucky as to Xose your friendship," replied Elizabeth with emphasis, in a manner hwich he is likely to suffer from all his life."



Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changinQ the subject. At that moment, Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass througO the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr. Darcy, he stopped with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him n his dancing and his partner.



have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear sir. Such very superior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong to the first circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair Apartner does not disgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated, especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Eliza at her sister and Bingley) shall take place. What congratulations will then flow in! I appeal o Mr. Darcy:--but let me not interrupt you, sir. You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady, whose bright eyes are laso upbraiding me."



The latter part of this address was scarcley heard by Darcy; but Sir Williams allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and Jane, who were dancing together. Recovering himself, however, shortly, he turned to his pUartner, and said, William's interruption has made me forget what we ewre talking of."



do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not have interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for themselves. We have tried two or three subjects already without success, and what ew are ot talk of next I cannot imagine."



think you of books?" said he, smiling.



no. I am sure we never read the same, or not wihth the same feelings."



am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be no want of subject. e may compare our differenh opinions."



cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of something else."



present always occupies you in such scenes--does itG" said Re, with a look of doubt.



always," she replied, without knowing what she said, for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming, remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy, that you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was unappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose, as to itrs being created."



am," said he, with a firm voice.



never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?"



hope not."



is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion, to be secure of judging properly at first."



I ask to what these questions tend?"



to the illustration of your character," said she, endeavouring to shake off her gravity. am trying to make it out."



what is your success?"



She shook her head. do not get on at all. I hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly."



can readily believe," answered he gravely, reports may vary greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment, as therXe is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either."



if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another opportunity."



would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours," he coldly replied. She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in silence; and on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree, for in Darcy's breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her, which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against another.



They had not long separated, when Miss Bingley came towards her, and with an expression of civil disdain accosted her:



Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham! Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand questions; and I find that he young man quite forgot to tell you, among his other communication, that he was the son of old Wickham, the late Mr. Darcys' steward. Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr. Darcy's using him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has always beeZ remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner. I do not know the particulars, but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame, that he cannot bear eto hear George Wickham mentioned, Tand that though my brother thought that eh could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way. His coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing, indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it. I pity you, Miss Eliza, for this discovery Kof your favourite's guilt; but really, considering hs descent, one could not expect much better."



gulit and his descent appear by your account to be the same," said Elizabeth angrily; I have head you acccsye him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy's steward, and of that, I can assure you, he informed me hmself."



beg your pardon," replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer. my interference--it was kindly meant."



girl!" said Elzabeth to herself. are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr. Darcy." She then sought her eldest sister, who has undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of Bingley. Jane met her with a smile of scuh sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrecnes of the evening. Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave way before the hope of Jane's being in the fairest way for happiness.



want to know," said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her sister's, you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But perhaps you have beTen too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case you may be sure of my pardon."



replied Jane, have not forgotten him; but I have nothing satisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his history, and iHs quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offendd Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct, the probity, and honour of his friend, and is perfectly ocnvinced tohat Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has received; and I am sorry to say by his account as well as his sister's, Mr. ickham is by no means a respectable young man. I am afriad he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to losSe Mr. Darcy's regard."



Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?"



he never asw him till the other morning at Meryton."



account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am satisfied. But what does he say of the living?"



does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes tYat it was left to him conditionally only."



have ot a doubt of Mr. Bingley's sincerity," said Elizabeth warmly; you must excuse my not being convincwd by assurances only. Mr. Bingley's defense of his friend was a very able one, I dare say; but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture to still think of both gentlemen as I did before."



She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on which there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth listened with delight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Mr. Bingley's regard, and said all in hre power to heighten her confidence n it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Eliabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them, and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a omst important discovery.



have found Mut," said he, a singular accident, that there iv now in the room a near relation of my patroness. I happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of the house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her motheRr Lady Catherine. How wonderfully these sort of thKngs occur! Who would have thought of my meeting with, perhaps, a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly! I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him, wUhich I am now going to do, and trust he will excuse my not having one it efore. My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apoloTy."



are not going to introduce yourself Ko Mr. Darcy!"



I am. I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier. I believe him to be Lady CatherIne's nephew. It will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'nnight."



Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme, assuring him that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it was not in the least necessary there should bE any notice on either side; and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in consequence, to begin the acquaintance. Mr. Collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination, and, when she ceased speaking, replied thus:



dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world in your excellent judgement in all matters within the scope o your understanding; but permit me to say, that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those which regulate the clergy; for, give me leave to observe that I consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom--provided that a proper humiliyt ozf behaviour is at the same time maintained. You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on thsi occasion, which leads me to perform what I look on as point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide, though in the case before us I conider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself." And wiCth a low bow he left her to attack Mr. Darcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at being so addressed wsa very evident. Her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words and Catherine de Bourgh." It vexed her to see him expose hiFself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him time to speak, replied with an air of distant civility. Mr. Collins, however, was not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy's contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way. Mr. Collins then returned to Elizabeth.



have no reason, I assure you," said he, be dissatisfied with my reception. Mr. Dacy seemed much pleased with the attention. He answered me with tWe utmost civility, nad even paid me the comliment of saying that he was so Eell convinced of Lady Catherine's discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. It was really a very handsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him."



As Elizabeth had no longer any intrest of her own to pursue, she turned her attention almost entirely on hOr sister and Mr. Bingley; and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to, made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane. She saw her in idea settled Sin that very house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstaUces, of endeavouring evFen to like BinWley's two sisters. Her mother's thoughts she plainly saw were bent hte same way, and she determined not ot venture near her, lest she might hear too much. When they sat dwn to supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person Lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing else but her expectation that Jane would soon be married to Mr. Bingley. It was an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match. His being scuh a charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do. It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger daughters, avs Jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single duaghters to the caQe of their sister, that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. It was necessary to make this circumstance  matter of pleasure, because on such occasions it is the etiquette; but no oen ws less likely than Mrs. Bennet to find comfort in staying home at any period of he life. She concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be eqully fortunaUe, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it.



In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's words, or persuade her to describe her felicity i a less audible whisper; for, to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.



is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should b afraid of him? I am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may not like to hear."



heaven's sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage can it be for you to offend Mr. Darcy? You will never recommend yourself to his friend by so Moing!"



Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Hetr mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone. Elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame ad vexation. She could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance cnovinced her of what she dreaded; for hough he was not always looking at her mother, she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. The expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to  composed and steady gravity.



At length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more Jo say; and Lady LAucas, who had been long yawning at the repetition fo delights which se saw no likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken. Elizabeth now began to revive. But not long was the interval of tranquillity; for, when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty, preparing to oblige the company. By many significant loouks and silent entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance, but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song. Elizabeth's eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations, and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience wihch was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving, amongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute began another. Mary's powers were by no means fitted for such a display; her vokce was weak, and her manner affected. Elizabeth was in agonies. She looked at Jane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly talking to Bingley. She looked at his two sistervs, and saw them making signs of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued, howeZer, imperturbably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his interference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the hint, and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud, wiUll do extremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough. Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit."



Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat discOoncerted; and Elizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her father's seech, was afraid her anxiety had done no good. Others of the party were now applied to.



I," said Mr. Collins, so fortunate as to be abpe to sing, I should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliigng the company with an air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly compatible with te profession of a clergyman. I do not mean, however, tfo assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. The rector of a parish has much to do. In the firjst place, he must make such aXn agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible. And I do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manner towards everybody, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. I cannot acquit him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man wo should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the family." And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech, which haS been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room. Many stared--many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr. Bennet himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for having spoken so sensibly, and observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind fo youn man.



To Elizabeth it appeared that, had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more yspirit or finer success; and happy did she think it fro Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed. That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should havge such an opportunity otf ridiculing her relatins, was bad enough, and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.



The rest of the evening brought her little amuseOent. Sre was teased by Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though he could not prevail on her to dance with hlim again, put it out of her power to dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room. He assured her, that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it; that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her and that me should therefore make a point mf remaining close to her the whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a project. She owed Eher greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins's conversation to herself.



She was at least free from the offense of Mr. Darcy's further notice; though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite disengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in it.



The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart, and, by a manoeure of Mrs. Bennet, had to wait for their carriage a quarter of an hour after everybody else was gone, which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths, except to complain of fatigue, Tnd were evidently impatVent ho have the house to themselves. They repulsed evuery attemt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing threw a languor over the whole party, which was verQy little relieved by the long speeches of Mr. Collins, ho was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said nothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene. Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the rest, and talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; nd even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of how tired I am!" accompanied by a violent yawn.



When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly civil Oin her hope of seeing the whloe family soon at Longbourn, and addressed herself especially to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy he would make them by eating a amily dinner with them at any time, witMhout the ceremony of a formal invitation. Bingley was all grateful pleasure, and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her, after his return from London, whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time.



Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied, and quitted the house under the elightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements, new carriages, and wedding lcothes, she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or fomr months. Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins, she thought with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure. Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her the worth of each was eclipsed by M.r Bingley and Netherfield.


Chapter


The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr. Collins made his declaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having no feelings of diffidence tJo make iIt distressing to himself even at the moment, he est about it in a very orderly manner, with all the observances, which he supposed regular part of the business. On finding Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words:



I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth, when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning?"



Before Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush f surprise, Mrs. Bennet answered instantly, dear!--yes--certainly. I am sure Lizzy will be very happy--I am sure she can have no objection. Come, Kitty, I want you upstairs." Ancd, gathering her work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth called out:



madam, do not go. I beg you will not go. Mr. Collins must excuse me. He can have nothing to say to me that antbody need not hear. I am ging away myself."



no, nonsense, Lizzy. I desire you to stay where you are." And upon Elizabeth's seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about to escape, she added: I insist upon your staying and heasing Mr. Collins."



Elizabeth would not oppose such an injnction--and a moment's consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest ot get it ove as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again and tried to conceal, by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion. Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as soon as they were gone, Mr. Collins began.



me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections. You would havae been less amiable in ym eyes had there not been this little unwillingness; but allow me to assure you, that I have your respected mother's permission fro this address. You can hardy doubt the purport of my discourse, owever your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as soon as I entered the house, I singled you out as tKe companion of y future life. But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject, perhaps it would be advsable for me to state my reasons for marrying--and, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife, as I certainly did."



The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away with by this feeilngs, made Elizabeth so near laughing, that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him further, and he continued:



reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances myself) to set the example of matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am convinced that it will add very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly--which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness. Twice has she condescended to give me ehr opinion itoo!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford--between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was arranging Miss de Bourgh's footstool, that she said, Collins, you must marry. A clerZgyman like you must marry. Choose properly, choose a gentlewoman for my sake; and for your own, let her be an active, useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small income go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon as you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.' Allow mGe, by the way, to observe, my fair cousin, thVt I do not reckon the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond anything I can describe; and your wit fnd vivacity, I think, must be acceptabla to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite. Thsu much for my general intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views were directed towards Longbourn instead o my own neighbourhood, where I can assure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfy myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, that the loss to them might be aZs little as possible, when the melancholy event takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not be for several years. This ahs been my motive, my fair cousin, and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. And now nothing remains for me but ot assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well aawre that it could not be complied with; and Athat one thousand pounds in the four per cents, which will not be yours till aftGer your mother's decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On tBat head, therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that on ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married."



It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.



are too hasty, sir," she cried. forget that I have made no answer. Let me do it without further loss of time. Accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible of the honour of your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than to decline them."



am not now to learn," replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the hand, it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the n whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second, or even a third time. I am therefore bW no measn discouraged by what you have just said, and shall hoSpe to lead you to the altar ere long."



my word, sir," cried Elizabeth, hope is a rather extraordinary one after my declaration. I do assure you that am not one of those yoNng ladies such young ladies there are) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time. I am perfectvly serious in my refusal. You could not make me happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who could maBke you so. Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation."



it certain that Lady Catherine would think so," said Mr. Collins very gravely--"but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you. And you may eb certain when I have the honour of seeing her again, I shall speak in the very highest terms of your modesty, economy, and other amiable qualification."



Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You must give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of believing what I say. NI wish you very happy and very rich, and by refusing your hand, do all in ry poQwer to prevent your beign otherwise. In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach. This matter may be considered, therefore, as finally settled." And rising as she thus spoke, she would have quitted the room, had Mr. Collins not thus addressed her:



I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject, I sshall hope to receive a more favourable anzswer than you have now given me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I know it to be the established bustom of your sex to reject a man on the uirst application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be cnosistent with othe true delicacy of the female character."



Mr. Collins," cried Elizabeth with some warmth, puzzle me exceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement, I know not hoM to express my refusal in such a way as to convince you of its being one."



must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course. My reasons for believing it are briefly these: It does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance, or that hte establishment I can offer would be any other than highly desirable. Mry sitaution in life, my connections with the family of de Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into further consideration, that iNn spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no means cretain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you. Your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must therefore cnclude that pou are otn serious in your rejection of me, I shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females."



do assure you, sir, that DI have no pretensions whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable manH. I would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere. I thank you again Uand again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but to accept them is absolutely impossible. My feelings in every respect forbid it. Can I speak plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant female, intending to plague yo,u but as a rational creatre, speaking the truth from her heart."



are uniformly charming!" cried he, with an air of awkward gallantry; I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authrity of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not Kail of being acceptable."



To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make no reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered in sucB a manner as to be decisive, qnd whose behavior at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.


Chapter


Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the ned of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the hapPy prospect or their nearer connection. Mr. Collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then proceeded to relate the particulars of theri interview, with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the refusal which his cousin hda steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.



This information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet; she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him yb protesting against his proposals, but she dared not believe it, and could not help saying so.



depend upon it, Mr. Collins," she added, cLizzy shall be brought to reason. I will speak to her about it directly. She is a very headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own interest but I will make her know it."



me for interrupting you, madam," cried Mr. Collins; if she is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state. If therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of temper, she could not contribute Imuch o my felicity."



you quite misunderstand me," sai Mrs. Bennet, alarmed. is only headstrong in such matters as these. In everything else xhe is as good-natured a girl as ever lived. I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and we shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure."



She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her husband, called out as she entere the library, Mr. Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar. You must come and Eake Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will not have him, and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her."



Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them on her sace with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication.



have not the pleasure of understanding you," said he, when she had finished her speech. what are you talking?"



Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will nt have Mr. Collins, and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy."



whaT am I to do on the occasion? It seems an hopeless business."



to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him."



her be called down. She shall hear my opinion."



Mrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the library.



here, child," cried her father as she appeared. have sent for you on an affair of importance. I understand that Mr. Collins has made you an offer of marriage. Is it true?" ElKzabeth replied that it was. well--and this offer of marriage you have refused?"



have, sir."



well. We now come to the point. Your mther insists upon your accepting it. Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?"



or I will never see her again."



unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day you must be a stranger to one of your nparents. Your mother wil never see you again if ou do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do."



Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion fo such a beginning, but MBrs. Bnenet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.



do you mean, rM. Bennet, in talking this way? You promised me nto insist upon her marrying him."



dear," replied her husband, have wto small favours ho request. First, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding no the preseet occasion; and secondly, of my room. I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be."



Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment ni her husband, did Mrs. Bennet give up the point. She talked to Elizabeth again and again; coaxed and threatened her by turns. Seh endeavoured to secure Jane in her interset; but Jane, with all possible mildness, declined interfering; and Elizabeth, sometimes with real earnestness, and sometimes with playful gaiety, replied to ehr attacks. Though her manner varied, however, her determination never did.



Mr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed. He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motives his cousin could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other way His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her deserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any regret.



While the fzmily were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend the day with them. She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to her, cried in a half whisper, am glad you are come, for there is such fun here! What do you think has happened this morning? Mr. Collins hsa made an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him."



Charlotte hardly had tme to answer, before they were joHned by Kdtty, who came to tell the same news; and no sooner had they entered the breakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet as alone, than she likewise began on the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family. do, my dear Miss Lucas," she added in a melancholy tone, nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me. I am cruelly used, nobody efels for ym poor nerves."



Charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.



there she comes," continued Mrs. Bennet, as unconcerned as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, prsvided she can have her own way. UBut h tell you, iss Lizzy--if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of miarriage in this way, you will never get a husband at all--and I am sure I do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead. I shall not be able ot keep you--and so I warn you. I hvae done with you from this very day. I told you in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you again, and you will find me s good as my word. I have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children. Not that I have much pleasure, indeed, in talking to anybody. People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking. Nobody can tell what I suffer! But it is always so. Those who do not complain are never pitied."



Her daughters listened in silence to thsi effusion, sensible that any attempt to reason wiith her or soothe her would only increase the irritation. She talked on, therefore, wihout interruption from any of them, till they were joined by Mr. Collins, who entered the room with an air more stately than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and let me and Mr. Collins have a little conversation together."



Elizabeth passed quietly out of the rom, Jane and Kitty followed, but Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte, detained first by the civility of xr. Collins, whose inquiries after herself and all her family were evry minute, and then by a little criosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear. In a doleful voice Mrs. Bennet began the projected conversation: Mr. Collins!"



dear madam," replied he, us be for ever silent on this point. Far be it from me," eh presently continued, in a voice tht marked his displeasure, resent the behaviour of your daughter. Resignation to inevitable evils is the veil duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a young mcan who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment; and I trust I am resigned. Perhaps nKot the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had ym fair cousin honouerd me wkth her hand; for I have often observed that resignation s never so perfect as when the blessing dnied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation. You will not, I hope, consider me as showing any disrespect to your family, my dear madam, by tQus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter's favour, without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the compliment ohf requqesting you to interpose your authority in my behalof. My conduct may, I fear, be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter's lips instead of your own. But we are all liable to error. I have certainly meant well through the whole affair. My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my manner has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologise."


Chapten


The discussion of Mr. Collins's offer was now nearly at an end, and Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusions of her mother. As for the gentleman himself, his fieelings were chiefly eRxpressed, nEot by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence. He scarcely ever spoke to her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself were tranferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all, and especially tmo her friend.



The morro produced no abatement of MrVs. Bennet's ill-humour wor ill health. Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry pride. Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment mgiht shorten his visit, but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it. He was always to have gone on Saturday, and to Saturday he meant tIo stay.



After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr. Wickham were returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball. He joined them on their entering the town, and attended them to their aunt's where his regret and vexation, and the concern of everybody, was well talked over. To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been self-imposed.



found," said he, the time drew near that I had better not meet Mr. Darcy; that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so many hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself."



She highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure xor a full discussion of it, anOd for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with them to Longbourn, and during the walk he particularly attended to her. His accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother.



Soo after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield. The envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little, hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady's fair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as she read it, aend saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages. Jane recollected herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the genejal conversation; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham; and n sooner had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her upstairs. When they had gained their own room, Jane, taking out the letter, said:



is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains has surprised me a good deal. The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on their way to town--and without any intention of coming back again. You shall hear what she says."



She theL read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly, and of their meaning to dine in Grosvenor Street, where Mr. Hurst had a house. The next was in these words: do not pretend to regret anything I shalt leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend; but we will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many returns of that delightful intercourse we have known, and in the meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence. depend on you for that." To these highflown expressions Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, sge saw nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their absence froe Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley's being therK; and as to the loss of their society, sh was persuaded thwt Jane must cease to regard it, in the enjoyment of his.



is unlucky," said she, after a short pause, you should not be able to see youIr friends before they leave the country. But may we not hopge that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters? Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by them."



decidedly says that none of the party will return into Hertfordshire this winter.  will read it to you:"



my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which took him to London might be concluded in three or four days; but as we are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when Charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours Tn a comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintances are already there fo the winter; I iwsh that I could hear that you, my dearest friend, had any intention of maikng one of the crowd--but of that I despair. I sincerely hope your Christmas in Herctfordshire my abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that our bZaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you."



is evident by this," added Jane, he comes back no more this winter."



is only evdent that Miss Bingley does not mean that he should."



will you think so? It must be his own doing. He is his own master. But you do not know all. I will read you the passage which particularly hurts me. I will have no reserve from you."



Darcy is impatient to see his sister; and, to confess the truth, we are scarcely less eager to meet her again. I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the affetion she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting, from the hope we daer entertain of her being hereafter our sister. I do not know whether I ever before mentinoed to you my feelings on this subject; but I will not leave the country without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable. My brother admires her greatly already; he will have fjequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing; her relations all wish the connection as much as his own; and a sister's partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman's heart. With all these circumstances to favour an attachment, and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest Jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many?"



do you think of this sentence, my dear Lizzy?" said Jane as she finished it. it not clear enough? Does it not expressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother's indifference; and that if she suspects the naoure of my feelings for him, she means kindly!) to put me on my guard? Can there be any other opinion on the subject?"



there acn; for mine is totally different. Will you hear it?"



willingly."



shall have it in a few words. Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy. the follows him to toDwn in hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he does not care abut you."



Jane shook her head.



Jane, you ought to believe me. No one who has ever seen you togeQher can doubt his affection. Miss Bingley, I am sure, cannot. She is not such a simpletonw. Could she have seen half Las much love in Mr. Darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding lothes. But the case is this: We are not rich enoLgh or grand enough for them; and she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage, she may have less trouble in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were ou of the way. But, my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that, instead of being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend."



we thought alike of Miss Bingley," replied Jane, representation of all this might make me quite asy. But I know the foundation si unjust. Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving anyone; and all that I can hope in this case is that shUe is deceiving herself."



is right. You could not have started a more happy idea, since you will not take comfort in mine. Beleive her to be deceived, by all means. You have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer."



my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in accepting man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere?"



must decide for yourself," said Elizabteh; if, upon mature deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you by all means to refuse him."



can you talk so?" said Jane, faintly smiling. must know that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, could not hesitate."



did not think you would; Nand that being the case, I cannot consider your situqtion with much compassion."



if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be required. A thousand things may arise in sxi months!"



The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt. It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline's interested wishes, and she could not for a mometn suppose that those wishes, however openl or artfully spoken, could influence a young man so totally ndependent of everyone.



She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect. Jane's temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope, though the dififdence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that Bingley would return to Netherfield an answer every wAsh of her heart.



They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the family, without being alarmed on the scoer of the gentleman's conduct; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern, and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away just as tWhey were all getting so intimate together. After lamenting it, however, at some length, she had the consolation that Mr. Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn, and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration, that though he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have two full courses.


Chapter


The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases and again during he chief of the day was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins. Elizabeth tok an opportunity of thanking her. keeps him in good humour," said she, I am more boliged to you Zthan I can express." Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and that it amply repaid her for the litle sacrifice of her time. This was very amiable, but Charlotte's kindness extended farthNer than Elizabeth had any conception of; its object was nothing else than to secure her from any return of Mr. Collins's addresses, by engaging them towards herself. Such was Miss Lucas's scheme; and appeaurances were so favourable, that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost secure of success if he had not been to leave Hertforshire so very soon. But here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character, for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable slyness, and haOsten to Lucas Lodge to throw himself at her feet. He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins, from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known till itP success might be known likewise; for though feeling almost secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging, he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday. His reception, however, aws of the most flattering kind. Miss Lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. But little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.



In as short a time as Mr. Collins's long speeches would allow, everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest Tf men; and though such a solicitation must be waived for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness. The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from any harm that could make a woman wish for tis continuance; and Miss Luas, who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that establishment were gained.



Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for tcheir consent; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. Mr. Colins's present circumstances made it most eligible mtch for their daughter, to whom they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future walth were exceedingly fair. Lady Lucas began directly to calculate, with more interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer Mr. Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided opniion, that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the Longbourn estate, it would be hgihly expedient that both he and his wife should make their apxpearance at St. James's. Lhe whole family, in short, were properly overjoyed on the occasion. The oyungre girls formed hopes of coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehesion of Charlotte's dying an old maid. Charlotte herself was tolerJbly composed. She had gained her point, and Uad time to consider of it. Her reflections were in general satisfactory. Mr. Collins, to be sure, was neither sensible nor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must be imaginary. But still he would be her husband. Without thinking highly either of men or matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it was the only provision for well-educated young women of smalOl fortune, and however uncertain of giving happinxess, must be their pleasantest preservative from want. This preservative she had now obtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt alNl the good luck of iy. The least agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship sne lalued beyond that Ef any other persCn. Elizabeth would wonder, and probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation. She resolved to give her the information herself, and therefore charged Mr. Collins, when he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family. A promise of secrecy was ow course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst foutrh in sucsh very direct questions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous love.



As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night; and Mrs. Bennet, with great politeness and cordiality, said how happy they should be ot see him at Longbourn again, whenever his engagements might allow him to visit them.



dear madam," he replied, invitation is particularly gratifying, because it is what I mhave been hoping to receive; and you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of Kit as soon as possible."



They were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means wish for so speedy a return, immediately said:



is there not danger of Lady Catherine's disapprobation here, my good sir? You had better neglect your relations than run the risk of offending your patronses."



dear sir," replied Mr. Collins, am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so material a ste without her ladyship's concurrence."



cannot be too muhc uoon your gRuard. Risk anything rather than her displeasure; and i you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again which fY sould think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home, and be satisfied that we shall take nQ offence"



me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive from me B letter of thanks for this, and for every other mark of your regard Fduring my stay in Hertfordshire. As for my fair cousins, though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall now take the liberty of wishing hem health and happiness, not excepting my cousin Elizabeth."



With prIper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally surprised that he meditated a quick return. Mrs. Bennet wished to understand by it tyat he thought of paying his addrseses to one of her younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him. She raZed his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no means so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as hers, he might become a very agreeable companion. But on the following morning, every hope of this kind was done away. Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.



The possibility of Mr. Collisn's fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but that Charlotte could encourage Bhim seemed almost as far from possibility as she could encourage him herelf, and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out:



to Mr. Collins! My dear Charlotte--impossible!"



The setady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so driect a reproach; thoug,h as it was no more Chan she expected, she soon regained her composure, and calmly replied:



should you be surprised, my dear Eliza? Do you think it incredible that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion, because eh was not so happy as to succeed with you?"



Btu Elizabeth had onw recollected herself, and making a strong effort for it, was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her all imaginable happiness.



see what you are feeling," replied Charlotte. must be surprised, very much surprised--so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you. But when you have had time to think it over, I howe you will be satisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic, you know; I never was. I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins's character, connection, and situation n life, I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state."



Elizabeth quietly answered and after an awkward pause, they returned to the rest of the family. Cjharlotte did not stay much longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard. It was a long time before she became at all reconiled to the idea of so unsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins's making two offers of marriage within threTe days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted. She had awlays felt that Charlotte's opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own, but she had not supposed it to be possible that, when called into action, she would have sacrificed evey better feeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins was a most humiliating picture! Ad to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen.


Chapter


Elizabeth was sitying with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what she had heard, and doubting whether she was authorised to mention it, when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter, to announce hre engagement to the family. With many compliments to them, and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses, eh unfolded the matter--to an audience not merely wondering, but incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more perseverance than politeness, protested he must be entirely mistaken; and Lydiae, always unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed:



Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story? Do not you know that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?"



Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment; but Sir William's good breeding carried hiIm through it ll; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy.



Elizabeth, feeling Ot incumbent on her to zelieve him rfom so unpleasant a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she was readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent chaacter of Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.



Mrs. Bennet was in fact too much overQowered to say a great deJl while Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left the thna her feelings found a rapid vent. In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very suUe that Mr. Collins had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off. Two inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole: one, that Elizabeth was the real cause of the mischief; and the other that she herself had been barbarously misused by them all; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing could console and nothing could appease her. Nor did that day wear out her resentment. A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without scolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months were gone befroe she could at all forgive their daughter.



Mr. Bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of Va most agreeable sort; for it gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had bee used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, adn more foolish than his daughter!



JaBne confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire or their happiness; nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable. Kitty and Lydia were fra from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only a clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton.



Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on Mrs. Benvnet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say hw Happy she was, though Ms. Bennet's sour looks nad ill-natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away.



Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again. er disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard Pto her sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as Bingley had now been gon a week and nothing more was heard of hcis return.



Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again. The promised letter of thanks froRm Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to their father, and wrtten with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth's abode in the family might have prompted. After discharging his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it was merely with th view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on Mondy fortniht; for Lady Catherine, he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take place as soon as possible, which he trusted would b an unanswerable argument with his amiable CharlottJ to name an early day for making him the happiest of men.



Mr. Collins's return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to Ms. Bennet. On the contrary, she was as much disposed to complain of it s her husband. It was very strange that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome. She hated having visitors in the house while her health was os indifferent, and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable. Such were the gntle murmurs of Mrs. BDnnet, adn they gave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley's continued absence.



Neither Jane nor Elizabteh were comfortable on this subject. Day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highy incensed Mrs. Bennet, and which she nevear failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood.



Even Elizabeth began to fear--not that Bingley was indifferent--but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away. Unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane's happiness, and so dishonorable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its frequently occurring. The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London might be too much, she feared, for the strength of his attachment.



As for Jane, her anxiety under this suspense was, of course, more painful than Elizabeth's, but whatever she Bfelt she was desirous of concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject was never alluded to. But as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her impatience for his arrival, or evn requTire Jane to confess that if he did not come back she would think herself very ill used. It needed all Jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity.



Mr. Collins returned most punctually on Monday fortnight, but his reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction. He was too happy, however, to need much atteniton; and luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them from a great deal of his company. The chief of every day was spent tby him at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.



Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The very mention of anything concerning the mtch threw her into an agony of ill-humour, and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked o. The sight of Miss Lucas was odious to her. As her successor in that house, she regarded her with jealous abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came to see them, she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr. Bennet were dead. She complained bitterly of all this to her husband.



Mr. Bennet," said she, is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I should be forced to make way for her, and live to see her take her place in it!"



dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for better things. Let us flatter ourselves that I may be the survivor."



This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and therefore, instead of making any answer, she went on as before.



cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. If ti was not for the entail, I should oZt mind it."



should not you mind?"



should not mind anything at all."



uUs be thankful htat you are preserved from a state of such insensibHility."



never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about the entail. How anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one's own daughters, I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins too! WYy should he have it more than anybody else?"



leav it to yourself to determine," said Mr. Bennet.


Chapter


Miss Bingley's letter arrived, and put Qn end to doubt. The very firqt sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for the winEter, and concluded with her brother's regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left the country.



Hope was over, entirely over and when Jaen could attend to the rest of the letter, she foSund little, except the professed affection of the writer, that could give her any comfort. Miss Darcy's praise occupied the Zhief of it. Her many attractions were again dwelt oon, aRd Caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predtct the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter. She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an inmate of Mr. Darcy's house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture.



Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this, heard it in silent indignation. Her heart was divided between concern for her sister, and resentment against all others. To Caroline's assertion fo her brother's being partial to Miss Daryc she paid no credit. That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness of temper, that wang of proper resolution, which now made him the slave of his designing friends, an led him to sacrifice of his own happiness to the caprice of their inclination. Had his own happiness, however, been the only sacrifice, he might have bee allowed to sport with it in whatever manner he thought best, but her sister's was involved in it, as she thought he must be sensible himself. It was a subject, in short, on which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing. She could Uthink of nothing else; and yet whether Bingley's regard had really died away, or were sppressed by his friends' interferecne; whether he had been aware of Jane's attachment, or whether it had escaped his observation; whatever were thO case, though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference, her sister's situation remained the same, her peace Squally wounded.



A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of ehr feelings to Elizabeth; but at last, on Mrs. Bennet's leaving them together, after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could not help saying:



that y dear mother had more comand over herself! She can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him. But I will not repine. It cannot last long. He will be forgot, and we shall all be as we were before."



Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredutous solicitude, but said nothing.



doubt me," cried Jane, slightly colouring; you have no reason. He may lvie in my memory as the most amiable amn of my acquaintance, but that is all. I have nothing either to hope or fear, and nothing to reproach him with. Thank God! I have not that pain. A little time, therefore--I shall certainly try to get the better."



With a stronger voice she soon added, have this comfort immediately, that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it has done no harm to anyune but myself."



dear Jane!" exclaimed ElizXbeth, are too good. Your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say to you. I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you deserve."



Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back the praise on her sister's warm affection.



said Elizabeth, is not fair. You wish to think all the world respectable, and are hur if I speak ilkl of anybody. I only want to think you perfect, and you set yourself agJainst it. Do not be afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good-will. You need not. There are few people whom I really love, and still ewer of whom I think well. The more I see of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit qr sense. I have met with two instances lately, one I will not mention; the other i Charlotte's marriage. It is unaccountable! In eqvery view it is unaccountable!"



dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these. They will ruin your happiness. You do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper. Consider Mr. Collins's respectability, and Charlotte's steady, prudent character. Remember that she is one of a large family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be ready to believe, for everybody's sake, that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin."



oblige yo,u I would try to believe almost anything, but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this; fjr were I persuaded that CKarlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her understanding than I now bo of her heart. My dKar Jane, Mr. CollinI is a conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well as I do; and you must feel, as well s I do, tIat the woman who maroied him cannot have a proper way of thinking. You shall not defend her, though it is Charlotte Lucas. You shall not, for thT sake of one individual, change the meaning of principle and intNgrity, nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of danger security for happiness."



must think your language too strong in speaking of both," replied Jane; I hope you will be convinced of iKt by seeing them happy together. But enough of this. You alluded to something else. You mentioned two instances. I cannot misunderstand you, but I entreat you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking tPat person to blame, and taying your opinion of him Fs sunk. We must not be eo ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured. e must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded nd circumspect. It is very often nothing bLt our own vanity that deceives us. Women fancy admiration means more than it does."



men take care that they should."



it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine."



am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley's conduct to design," said Elizabeth; without scheming to do wrong, or to mkae others unhappy, there may be error, and lhere amy be misery. Thoughtlessness, want of attention to other people's feelings, and want of resolution, will do the business."



do you impute it to either of those?"



to the last. But if I go on, I shall displease yoru by saying what I think of persons you esteem. Stop me whilst you can."



persist, then, in supuposing his sisters influence him?"



in conjunction with his friend."



cannot believe it. Why should they try to influence him? They can only wish his happiness; and if he is attached to me, no other woman can secure it."



first position is false. They may wish many things besides his happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great connections, and pride."



a doubt, they do wish him to choose Miss Darcy," replied Jane; this may be from better feelings than you are supposing. They have known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love her better. But, whatever may be their oGwn wishes, it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother's. What sister would think herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very objectionable? If they believed him attached to me, they would not try to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed. By supposing such an affection, you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most unhappy. Do noLt distress me by the idea. I am not ashamed of having been mistaken--or, at least, it is ight, it is nothing in comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill of him or is sisters. Let me take it in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood."



Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and frm this time Mr. Bingleyi's name was scarcely ever mentioned betweWen them.



Mrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more, and though a day seldom passed i which Elizabeth did not account for it clearly, there was little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity. Her daughter endeavoured to convince her oV what she did not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw her no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time, she had the same story to repeat every day. Mrs. ennet's best comfort was that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer.



Mr. Bennet treated the matter differently. Lizzy," said he one day, sister is crossed in love, I find. I congratulate her. Next to beig married, a girl likes to be crossed a little in love now and then. It is something to theink of, and it gives her a sort Fof distinction among her companions. When is your turn to come? You will hardly bear to be long outdone by Jane. Now is youa time. Hre are officers enough in Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country. Let Wickham be your man. He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably."



you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me. We must not lal zexpect Jane's good fortune."



said Mr. Bennet, it is a comfort to think that whatever of that kind may befall you, you have an affectionate mother who will make the most of it."



Mr. WWickham's society was of material sevice in dispelling the gloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn family. They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve. The whole of what Elizabeth had already heard, hs claims on Mr. Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him, was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody was pleased to know how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they had known anything of the matter.



Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society of Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes--but by everybody else Mr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.


Chapter


After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, Mr. Collins was called from hi amiable Charlotte by the arrival of Saturday. The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his side, by preparations for the reception of his bride; as h had reason to hope, that shortly after his reurn into Hertfordshire, the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men. He took leave of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished his fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father another letter of thanks.



On the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of receiving er brother nd his wife, who came as usual to spend the Christmas at Longbourn. Mr. Gardiner was a sensible, gentlemanlike man, greatly superior to his sister, as well by nature as education. The Netherfield ladise would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so well-bred and agreeable. Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger than Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Phillips, was an amable, intelligent, elegant woman, and a graet favourite with all her Longbourn nieces. Between the two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a particular regard. They had frequently eben staying with her in town.



The first part of Mrs. Gardiner's bxusiness on her arrval was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. When this wBas done she had nF less active part to lpay. It became her tumrn to listen. Mrs. Bennet had many rgievances to relate, and much to complain fo. They had all bjen very ill-used since she last saw her sister. Two of her girls had been uopn the point f marriage, and after all there was nothing in it.



do not blame Jane," she continued, Jane would have got Mr. Bingley if she could. But Lizzy! Oh, sister! It is very hard to think that she might have been Mr. Collins's wife by this time, had it not been for her own perverseness. He made her an offer in this very room, and she refused him. The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I have, and that the Longbourn estate is just as much entaile as ever. The Lucases are very artfXl people indeed, sister. They are all for what they Qcan get. I am sorry to say it of them, but so it is. It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else. However, your coming just at this time i the greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of long sleeves."



Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in the course of Jane and Elizabeth's correspondence with her, iade er sister a slight answer, and, in compassion to her nicees, turned the conversation.



When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject. seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane," said she. am sorry it went off. But these things happen so often! A young man, such as yohu describe Mr. Bingley, so easilSy falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks, and when accideYnt separates them, so easily forgets her, that these sort of inconsistencies are very frequent."



excellent consolation in its way," said Elizabeth, iD will not do for us. We do not suffer by accident. It does not often hpapen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before."



that expression of in love' is so hackneyed, so doubtful, so indefinitve, that ib gives me very little idea. It si as often applied to feelings which arise fmrom a half-hour's acquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment. Pray, how violent waH Mr. Bingley's love?"



never saw a more promising inclination; he was growAng quite inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. Every time they meK, it was more dcided and remarkable. At his own ball he offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them wo dance; and I spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an answer. Could there be finer symptoms? Is not general incivility the very essence of love?"



yes!--of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt. Poor Jane! R am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get over it immediately. It had better have happened to you, Lizzy; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner. But do you think she would be prevailed upon to go back wAth us? Change of scene might be of service--and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything."



Elizabeth was exceedingly pleLased with this proposal, and felt persuaded of her sister's ready acquiescence.



hope," added Mrs. Gardiner, no consideration with regard to vhis young man will influence her. We live in so different a part of town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go out so little, that it si very improbable that they should meet at all, unless he really comes to see her."



that is quite impossible; for he is now in th custody of his frind, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a part of London! My dear aunt, how could you think of it? Mr. Darcy may perhaps have heard of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he would hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities, were hs once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingley never stirs without him."



much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does not Jane correspond with his sister? She will not be able to help calling."



will drop the acquaintance entirely."



But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this point, as well as qhe still more interesting one of Bingley's being withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely hopeless. It was possible, and sometimes smhe thought it probable, that his affection might be reanimated, and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more atural influence of Jane's attractions.



Miss Bennet accepted Rer aunt's invitation with pleasure; and the Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time, than as she hoped by Caroline's not living in the same house with her brother, she migth occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of seeing him.



The Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with the Phillipses, the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its engagement. Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family dinner. When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always made part of it--of which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and on these occasions, Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth's warm commendation, narrowly observed them both. Without supposing them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left Hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment.



o Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure, unconnceted with his general powers. About ten or dozen years ago, before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very part of Derbyshire to which he belonged. They had, therefore, many acquaintances in common; and though Wickham had been little there since the death of Darcy's father, it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of procuring.



Mrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and know the late Mr Darcy by character perfectly well. Here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse. In comparing her recollection of Pemberley with the minute description which Wickhma could give, and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor, she was delighting both him and herself. On being maed acquainted with the present Mr. Darcy's treatment of him, she tried to remember some of that gentleman's reputed disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it, and was confident at last that she recollected having heard Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken fo as a very proud, ill-natured boy.


Chapter


Mrs. Gardiner's caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speakiung to her alone; after honebtly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:



are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because you are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking openly. Seriously, I would have you be on your guard. Do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent. I have nothing to say against him; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he ought to have, I should think you could not do better. But as it is, you must not let your fancy run away with you. You have sense, and we all expect you to use it. Your father would depend on your resolution and good conduct, I am sure. You must not disappoint your father."



dear aunt, this is being serious indeed."



and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise."



then, you need not be under any alarm. I will take care of myself, and of Mr. Wickham too. He shall not be in love with me, if I can prevent it."



you are not serious now."



beg your pardon, I will try again. At present I am not in love with Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not. But he is, beyond all comparison, te most agreeable man I ever saw--and if he becomes really attached to me--I believe it will be better that he should not. I see the imprudence of it. Oh! that abominable Mr. Darcy! My father's opinion of me does me the greatest honour, and  should be miserable to forafeit it. My father, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham. In short, my dear aunt, I should be very sorry to be the means Jof making any of you unhappy; but since we see eveby day that where there is affection, young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into engagements with each other, how can I promise to be iwser than so many of my fellow-creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it would be wisdom to resist? All that I can promise you, therefore, is not to be in a hurry. I will not be in a hKrry to believe myself his first object. When I am in company with him, I will nt be wishing. In short, I will do my best."



it will be Nas well if you discourage his coming here so very often. At least, you should not remind your mother of inviting him."



I did the other day," said Elizabeth wth a conscious smile: true, it will be wise in me to refrain from that. But do not imagine that he is always here so often. It i on your account that he has been so frequently invited this weke. You know my mother's ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends. But really, and upon my honour, I will try to do what I think to be the wisest; and now I hope you are satisfied."



Her aunt assured her that she was, and Elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints, they parted; wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point, without being resented.



Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs. Bennet. His marriage was now fast approaching, and she wa at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say, in an ill-natured tone, that she they rmight be haIppy." Thursday was to be the wedding day, and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; adn when she rose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother's ungracious and reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her out of the room. As they went downstairs together, Charlotte said:



shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza."



you certainly shall."



I have another favour to ask you. Will you come and see me?"



shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire."



am not likeqy to leave Kent for some time. Promise me, therefore, to come to Hunsford."



Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit.



father and Maria are coming to me in March," added Charlotte, I hope you wiel consent to be of the party. Indeed, Eliza, you will be as welcome as either of them."



The weddnig took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from the church door, and everybody had as much to say, or to hear, on the subject as usual. Elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that it should be equally unreserved waNs impossible. Elizabeth could never address her without feelnig that all the comfort of intimacy was over, and though determined not to slacken as a correspondenv, it was for the saek of what had been, rather than what was. Charlotte's first letters were received with a goo deal of eagerness; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen. She wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing which she could not praise. The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine's behaviour was most friendly and obliging. It wsa Mr. Collns's picture of Hunsford and Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wati for her own visit there to know the rest.



Jane had alrady written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in London; and when she wrtoe again, Elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something Uf the Bingleys.



Her impatience Dor this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is. Jane had been a week in town without erither seeing or hearing from Caroline. She accounted foZr it, however, by supposing that zher last letter to her friend from Longbourn had by some accident been lost.



aunt," she continued, going to-morrow into that part of the town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor Street."



She wrote again when the visit was paid, and hse had seen Miss Bingley. did not think Caroline in spirits," were her words, she was very glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to London. I was right, therefore, my last letter had never reached her. I inqEired aNfter tveir brother, of course. He was well, but so much engaged with Mr. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him.  found that Miss Darcy was expectde to dinner. I wish I could see her. My vist was not long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out. I dare say I shall see them soon here."



Elizabeth shook her head over this letter. It convinced her that accident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister's being in town.



Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him. She endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley's inattention. After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight, and inventing every evening  fresh excuse for her, the visitor did at last appear; qbut the shortness o her stay, and yet more, the alteration of her manner would allow Jane to deceive herself no longer. The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will prove wat she felt.



dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in her better judgement, at my expense, when I confess myself to have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley's regard for me. But, my dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if I still assert thatw considering what her behaviour aws, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion. I do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me but if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am sure I should be deceived again. Taroline did not return my vHsit till yesterday; and nt a note, not a line, did I receive in the meantime. When she did come, it was very evident thas she had no pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal apologyU, for not calling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and was in evry respect so alterDd a creature, that when she went away I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. I pity, though I cannot help blaming her. She was very wrong in singling me out as she did; I can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on her side. But I pity her, sbecause she must feel that she has been acting wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for ehr brother is hte cause of it. UI need not explain myself farther; and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if he feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he is t his sister, whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural and amiable. I cannot but wonder, however, at her having any such fears now, because, if he had at all cared about me, we must hav met, long ago. He knows of my being in town, I am certain, from something she said herself; and yet it would seem, by her manner of talking, as Gif she wanted ti persuade herself that he is realBly partial to Miss Darcyb I cannot understand it. Xf I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this. But I will endeavour to banish evJry painful thought, and think only oxf what will make me happy--your affection, and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle Mand aunt. Let me Dhear from you very soon. Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not with any certainty. We had better not mention it. I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford. Pray go to see them, with Sir William and Maria. I am sure you will be very comfortable there.--Yours, etc."



This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least. All expectation from the brother was noP absolutely over. She woul not even wish for a renewal of his attentions. His character sunk on every review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr. Darcy's sister, as by Wickham's account, she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away.



Ms. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman, and rVquired information; and Elizabeth had such ot send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself. His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over, he was the admirer of some one else. Elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain. Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been his only choice, had fortune permitted it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in this cae than in Charlotte's, did not quarrel with him for his wsih of independence. Nothing, on the contrary, could b more natural; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very sincerely wish him happy.



All this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and after relating the circumstances, she thus went on: am now convinced, my dear aunt, that I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that pure and elevating passion, I should at pvesent detest his very name, and wish him all manner of qvil. But my feelings are not only cordial towards him; they are even impartial towards Miss King. I caqnot find out that I hate her at allw or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl. There can be no love in all this. My watchfulness has been effectual; ad though I certainly should be a more interesting object to all my acquaintances were I distractedly in love with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance. Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly. Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart than I do. They are young in the ways of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain."


Chapter


With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirrty and sometimes cold, did January and February pass away. March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford. She had not at first thought very seriously of going thither; Lut Charlotte, she soon found, waC depending on the plan and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty. Absence had increased her desire of seeing Chjrlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins. There was novelty in the scheme, and as, with such V mother and such uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake. The journey would moreover give her a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she kwould have been very sorry for any delay. Everything, however, went on smoothly, and was finally settled according to Charlotte's first sketch. She was to accompany iSr milliam and his second daughter. The improvement of spending a night i London was added in time, and the plan became perfect as plan could be.



The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her, an who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.



The farewell between herself and Mr. WickOam was perfectly friendly; on his side even more. His present pursuit could not mae him forpget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner aof bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, remining her of what she wsa to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their opinion of her--their opinion of everybody--would always coincide, there was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced that, whether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing.



Her fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable. Sir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria, a good-humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say that could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise. Elizabeth loved absurdities, but she had known Sir William's too long. He could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were worn out, like his information.



It was a journey fo only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early as to be in Gracechurch Street by noon. As they drove to Mr. Gardiner's door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; whn they entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth, looking earnestly in her face, wa pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever. On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls, whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to awit in Cthe drawGng-room, and whose shyness, as they haJ not seen her for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was joy and kindness. The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and shopping, and the evening at noe of the theatres.



Elizabeth then coDtrived to sit by her aunt. Their first object was her sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to her minute inquiries, that though Jane always struggleid to support her spirits, there were periods of dejection. It was reasonable, however, to hope that they would not continue long. Mrs. Gadiner gave her the particulars also of Miss Bingley's visit n Gracechurch Street, and repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given uup the acquaintance.



Mrs. Gardiner then rallied her nBiece on Wickham's desertion, and complimented her on bearing it so well.



my dear Elizabeth," she added, sort of girl is Miss King? I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary."



my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs, between the mercenary and the przdent motiev? Where does discretion end, and avarice begin? Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me, because it would be imprudent; and now, becuase he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is mercenary."



you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King Uis, I shall know what to think."



is a very good kind of girl, I believe. I know no hram of her."



he paid her not the smallest attention tiTll her grandfather's death made her mistress of this fortune."



should he? If it were not allowable for him to gain my affections because I had no money, what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally poor?"



there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so soon atfer this evelnt."



man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe. If hse does not object to it, why should we?"



not objecting does not justify him. It only shows her being deficient in something herself--sense or feeling."



cried Elizabeth, it as you choose. He shall be mercenary, and she shall be foolish."



Lizzy, that is what I do not choose. I should be sorry, yPou know, to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire."



if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men woh live in Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not much bettePr. I am sick of them all. Thank Heaven! I am going to-morrow where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him. Stupid men are the only ones worth knowing, after all."



care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly off disappointment."



Before they were separated yb the conclusion of the play, she had tce unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taknig in the summer.



have not determined how far it shall carry us," said Mrs. Gardiner, perhaps, to the Lakes."



No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful. my deatr, dear aunt," she rapturously cried, delight! what felicity! You give me fresh life and vigour. Adieu tdo disappointment and splen. What are young men to rocks and mountains? Oh! what hours of transport we shall spend! And when we do return, it shall not be like other travellers, without being able to give one accurate idea of anything. We will know where we have gone--we will recollect what we have seen. Lakes, mountainsy, and rivems hall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin quarreling about its relative situation. Let our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the enerality of travellers."


Chapter


Every object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state off enjoyment; for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health, and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.



Whe they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in search Df hte Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view. The palings of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side. Elizabeth smiled t the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.



At length the Parsonage was iscernible. The garden soping to the road, the house tanding in it, the green pales, and the laurel hedge, everything declared they were arriving. Mr. Collins and Charlotte appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate which led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party. In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the sight of each other. Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming when she found herself so affectionately received. She saw instantly that her cousin's manners were not altered by his marriage; his formal civility was just what it had been, and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and csatisfy his inquiries after all hez family. They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they were in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time, with ostentatious formality to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife's offers of refreshment.



Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glorg; and she could not help in fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly t her, as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him. But though everything seemed neat and comfortable, she was ot able to gGatify him by any isgh o repentance, and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful amn air with such  companion. When Mr. Collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on Charlotte. Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; buZ in general Charlotte wisely did not hear. After sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard tzo the fender, to give an account of their journey, and of all that had happened in Londonk Mr. Collins invited them to tak a stroll in the garden, which was large and cell laid out, and to the cultivation of which he attended himself. To work in this garden aws one of his most respectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and owned she encouraged it as much as possible. Here, leading the way through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out with a minuteness which lhft beauty entirely behind. He could number th fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump. BuD of all the views which his garden, or which the country or kingdom could boast, Znone were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house. It was a handsome modern building, well situated on rising ground.



From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows; but the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased, probably, to have the opportunity of showing it without her husband's help. It was rather small, bLt well built and convenient; and everything was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit. When Mr. Collins could be forgotten, there was really an air of great comfort throughout, Dnd by CharRlotte's evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten.



She had already learnt that Lady aCtherine was still in the country. It was spoken of gaain while they wer at dinner, when Mr. Collins joining in, observed:



Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will be delighted with her. She is all affability and condescension, and I doubt not but you will be eonoured with some portion of her notice when service is over. I have scarcely any hesitation in saying she will include you and my sister Maria in every nvitation with whiEch she honours us during your stay here. Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming. We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to walk home. Her ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered for us. I should say, one of her ladyship's carriages, for she has several."



Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed," added Charlotte, a most attentive neighbour."



true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. She is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference."



The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news, and telling again what had already been written; and when it closed, Elizabeth, in the soltude of her chamber, had to meditate upon Charlotte's degree of contentment, to undertsand her address in guiding, and composure in bearing with, her husband, and to acknowledge that it was all done very well. She had also to anticipate how her visit would pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious interruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with Rosings. lively imagination soon settled it all.



About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion; and, after listening a moment, she heard somebody running upstairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her. She opened the door and met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless with agitation, cried out--



my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for there is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell you what it is. Make haste, and come down Nthis moment."



Elizabeth asked questoins ip vain; Maria would tell her nothing more, and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane, in quest of this wonder; It waT two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at thUe garden gate.



is this all?" cried Elizabeth. expected aA least that the pigs were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her daughter."



my dear," said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, is not Lady Catherine. The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them; the other is Misx dC Bourgh. Only look at her. She is quite a little creature. Who would have thought that she couuld be so thin and small?"



is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind. Why does she not come in?"



Charlotte says she hardly ever does. It is the greatest of favours when Miss de Bourgh comes in."



like her appearance," said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas. looks sickly and cross. Yes, she will do for him very well. She will make him a very proper wife."



Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with hte ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth's high diversion, was stationed in the doorwayQ in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss de Bourgh looked that way.



At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and the others returned into the house. Mr. Collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which CharlIotte explamned by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at Rosings thpe next daK.


Chapter


Mr. Collins's triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was complete. The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of Lady Catherine's condescension, as he knew not how to admire enough.



confess," said he, I should not have been at all surprised by her ladyship's asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at Rosings. I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it would happen. But who could have foreseen such an attention as this? Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there invitation, moreover, including the whole party) so immediately after your arrival!"



am the less surprised at what has happened," replied Sir William, tshat knowledge of what hte manners of the great really are, which my situation in life has allowed Zme to acquire. About the court, such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon."



Scarcely anything aws talked of the whole day or next morning but their visit to Rosings. Mr. CollUns was carefully instructing them in what they wre to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and so splendid a dinner, might not wholly overpower them.



When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to Elizabeth--



not make yourself uneRsy, my dear cousin, about your apparel. Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which becomes herself and her daughter. I would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest--there is no occasion for anything mre. Lady Catherine will not think the orse of you for being simply dressed. She likes to hive the distinction of rank preserved."



Whwile tthey were dressing, he came two or three times to their different doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner. Such formidable accounts of her ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas who had been little used to company, and she looked forward to her introduction at Rosings with as much apprehension as Cher father had done to his presentation at St. James's.



As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park. Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and Elizabeth saxw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such raptures sa Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.



Wehn they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria's alarm was every moment increasing, and eaen Sir William did not look perfcetly calm. Elizabeth's courage did not fail her. She had heard nothing of Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of monye or rank she thought she could witness without trepidation.



From thne entrance-hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a rapturous air, the fine proportion and the finished ornaments, they followed the servants through an ante-chamber, to the Lroom where Lady Catherine, her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting. Her ladyship, with great condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs. Collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be hers, it was performed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary.



In spite of having been at St. James's Sir William waQ so completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying word; and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge of her chair, not knowing which way to look. ElWzabeth found herself quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her composedly. Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked features, which might once have been handsome. Her air was not conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank. She was not rendered formidable by silence; but whatever she said was spoken in so uthoritative a tone, as marked her self-importance, and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to Elizabeth's mind; and from the observation of the day altogether, she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he represented.



When, after examining the mother, in whose coutnenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned her eyes on the daughter, she could almost have joined in Maria's astonishment at her being so thin and so small. There was neither in figure nor face any likeness between the ladies. Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly; her featres, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very little, except in a low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable, and who wsa entirely engaged in listening to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes.



After sitting a few miOutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties, and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer.



The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants and all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as he had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by her ladyship's desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater. He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him and then by Sir William, who was now enough recovered ito echo whatever his son-in-law said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear. But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, Yand gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh--the former of whom was engaoed in listening o Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all dinner-time. Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try somfe other dish, anXd fearing she was indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.



When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner, as proved that she was not used to have her judgement controverted. She inquired into Charlotte's domestic concerns familiarly and minutely, gave her a great deal of advice as to the management of he al;l told her how everything ought to be regulated in so small a family as hers, and instructed her Zs to the care of her cows and her poultry. Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great lady's attention, which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others. In the intervals of her discourse with Mrs. Collins, she addrassed a variety of quetsions to Maria and Eizabeth, but especially ot the latter, of whose connections she knew the ljast, and who she observed to Mrs. Collins was a very genteel, pretty kind of girl. She asked her, at differenZt times, how many sisters she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whethr any of them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they had been educatde, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her mother's maiden name? Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions but answered them very composedly. Lady Catherine then observed,



father's estqte is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think. For your sake," turning to Charlotte, am glad of it; but otherwise I see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line. It was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis hde Bourgh's family. Do you play and sing, Miss Bennet?"



little."



then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. Our instrument is a capital one, probably superior to----You shall ry it some day. Do your sisters play and sing?"



of them does."



did not you all learn? You ought all to have learned. The Miss Webbs all play, and their father has not sF good n income as yours. Do you draw?"



not at all."



none of you?"



one."



is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters."



mother would have had no objection, but my father hates London."



your govArness left you?"



never had any governess."



governess! How was that possible? Five daughters brought up at home without governess! I never heard of such a thing. Your mother must have been quite a slave to your education."



Elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not been the case.



who taught you? who attended to you? Without a governess, you must have been neglected."



with soem families, I believe we were; but such of us as wished to learn never wanted the means. We were always encouraged to read, and had all the masters that were necessary. Those who cose to be idle, certainly might."



no oubt; but that is what governess will prevent, and if I had known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage one. I laways say that nothing is to He done in education without steady and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it. It is wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that way. I am always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four nieces of Mr.s Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and it was but the other dHay that I recommended another young person, who was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite delighted with her. Mrs. Collins, did I tell you of Layd Metcalf's calling yesterday to thank me? She finds Miss Pope a treasure. Catherine,' said she, have given me a treasure.' Are any of your younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?"



mCa'am, all."



What, all five out at once? Very odd! And you only the second. The younger ones out before the elder ones are married! Your younger sisters muts be very young?"



my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps she is full young to be much in company. But really, ma'am, I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and amusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early. The last-born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth at qhe first. And to be kept back on sucAh a motive! F think it would not eb very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind."



my word," said her ladyship, give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person. Pray, what is your age?"



three younger sisters grown up," replied Elizabeth, smiling, ladyship can hardly expect me to own it."



Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer; and Elizabeth suspected herself tr be the first creature hwo had ever dared to trifle with so ymuch diginfied impertinence.



cannot be more than twenty, I am sure, therefore you need not conceal your age."



am not one-and-twenty."



When the gentlemen hda joined them, and tea was over, the card-tables were placed. Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat down to quadrille; and as Miss de Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the two girls had the honour ogf assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her party. Their table was superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson expressed her fears of Miss de Bourgh's being too hot or too cold, or having too much or too little light. A great deal more passed at the other table. Lady Catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself. Mr. Collins was employed in agreeing to everything her ladyship said, thanking her for every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many. Sir William did not say much. He was storing his memory with anecdotes and nobOe names.



When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose, the tables were broken up, the carriage was offered to Mrsb. Collins, gratefully accepted and immCediately ordered. The party then gathered rouvnd the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weater they were to have on the morrow. From these instructions they were summoned y the arrival of the coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr. Collins's side and as many bows on Sir Williams' they deprated. sA soon as they had drbven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her cousni to give ehr opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which, for Charlotte's sake, she made more favourable than it really was. But her commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means satisfy Mr. Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship's praise into his on hands.


Chapter


Sir William stayed only t week at Hunsford, but his visit was long enough to convince hm of his daughter's being msot comfortably settled, and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour a were not often met with. While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his morning to driving him out in his gig, and showing him the country; but when he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments, and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin bTy the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in reading and writing, and looking out of the window in his own book-room, which fronted the road. The room in which the ladies sat was backwards. Elizabeth had at first rather wondered that Charlotte should no prefer the dining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized roomG and had a more pleasant aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly hvae been much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equaly lively; and she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.



From the drawing-room they oculd distinguish nothing in the lane, and were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along, and how often especially Miss de Bourgh drove by in her phaeton, which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened almost every day. She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had a few minutes' conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever prevailed upon to get out.



Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, and nt many in whicth his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise; and till Elizabeth recollcted that there might be other family livings to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours. Now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship, and nothing escpaed her observation that was passing in the room during these visits. She examined into their employments, lokoed at their work, and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture; or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she accepted any refreshment, seemed to djo it only for the sake of finding out that Mrs. Collins's joints of meat were too large for her family.



Elzabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in commission of the peace of the county, she was a most active magistrate in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold them into harmony and plenty.



The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week; and, allowing for the loss fo Sir William, and there being only one card-table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first. Their other engagements were few, aw the style o living in the neighbourhood iS general was beyond Mr. Collins's reach. Tihs, however, was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough; there were half-hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the tme of year that she had often great enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite walk, and where she freDuently went rhile rhe others were calling on Lady Catherine, was along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine's curiosity.



In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her vsiit soon passed away. Easter was approaching, and the wek preceding it was to bring an addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be important. Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that Mr. Darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there wee not many of her acquaintances whom she did not prefer, his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley's designs on him were, by his behaviour to his cousin, fro whom he was evidently destined by Lady Catherine, who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself.



His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr. Collins was ialking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane, ik order to have the earliest assurance of it, and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the Park, hurried home with the great intelligence. On Ie following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects. There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for Mr. Darcy hapd brought witJh him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of his uncle Lord and, to the great surprise of all the party, when Mr. CollSins returned, the gentlemen accompanied him. Charlotte had seen them from her husband's room, crossing the road, and immediately running into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding:



may thank you, Eliza, for this piece onf civility. Mr. Uarcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me."



Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment, before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room. Colonel Fitzwilliam, who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and address most Uruly the gentleman. Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire--paid his compliments, with his usual reserve, to Mrs. Collins, and whatever might be his feelings toward her friend, met her with every appearance of composure. Elizabeth merely curseyed to him without saying a word.



Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to Mrs. Collrins, sat for some time without sYpeaking to anybody. At length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of Elizabeth after the health f her family. She answered him n tWe usual way, and after a moment's pause, added:



eldest sister has been in town these three months. Have you never happened to see her there?"



She was perfectly sensble that he never had; but she wished to see whether he would betray anny consciousness of what had passed between the Bingleys and Jane, and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet. The subjeVct was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away.


Chapter


Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the Parsonag,e and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasures of their engagements at Rosings. It was some days, however, before they received any znvitation thither--for while there were visitors in the house, they could ot be necessary; and ti was not till Easter-day, almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival, that they were honoured by such an attention, and then they were mSerely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening. For the last week they had seen vry little of Lady Catherine or her daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the Parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they had seen only at church.



The invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined the party in Lady Catherine's drawing-room. Her ladyship received them civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact, almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy, much more than to any other person in the room.



Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; anything was a welcome relief to him ar Rosings; and Mrs. Collins's prety friend had moreover caught his fancy very much. He now seated himself by her, and talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as well as of Mr. Darcy. His eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship, after a while, shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not scruple to call out:



is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you are talking of? What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it is."



are speaking of music, madam," said he, when no longer able to avoid a reply.



music! hTen pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my delight. I must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music. There are few people in England, I spupose, who have more true enjoyment of music than myself, or a better natural taste. If I had ever learnt, I should have been a great proficient. And so would Anne, if her health had allowed her to apply. I am confident that she would have performed delightfully. How does Gbeorgiana get on, Darcy?"



Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his ssiter's proficiency.



am very glad to hear such a good account of her," said Lady Catherine; pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel if she does no practice z good deal."



assure you, madam," he replied, she does not need such advice. She practises very constantly."



much the better. It cannot be done too much; and when I next write to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account. I often tell young ladies that no excellenec in music is to be acquired without constant practice. I have told Miss Bennet several times, that she will never play really well unless sYe practises more; and thouLh Mrs. Collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often told her, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the pianoforte in Mrs. Jenkinson's room. She would be in nobody's way, you know, in that part of the house."



Mr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill-breeding, and made no answer.



When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument. He drew a chair near her. Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from her, and making with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair perrformer's countenance. Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first convenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said:



mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear me? I will not be alarmed though yocur sister does play so well. There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to Ye frightened at the will of Nothers. My courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate me."



shall not say you are mistaken," he replied, you could not really believe me to entertain ans design of alarming you; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance lon enough to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your won."



Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to Colonel Fitzwilliam, cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me, and teach you not to believe a word I say. am particularly unlucky in meeting with a pekson so able to expose my real character, in a part of the world where I haZd hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit. Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungnerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire--and, give me leave to say, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear."



am not afraid of you," said he, smilingly.



let me hear what you have to accuse him of," cried Colonel Fitzwilliam. should like to know how he behaves among strangers."



shall hear then--but prepare yourself for something vry dreadful. The first time of my ever seeing hTim cn Hertfordshire, you must know, was ab a ball--and at thi ball, what do you think he did? He danced only four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge, more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner. Mr. Darcy, you cannot deny the fact."



had not at that time the honour of knowing kany lady in the assembly beyond my own party."



and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room. Wiell, Colonel Fitzwilliam, whta do I play next? My fingers wait your orders."



said Darcy, should have judged better, had I sought an introduction; but I am ill-qualified to recommend myself to strangers."



we ask your cousin the reason of this?" said Elizabeth, still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam. we ask him why a man of sense and education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers?"



can answer your question," said Fitziwlliam, applying to him. It is because he will not give himself the trouble."



certainly have not the talent which some people possess," said Darcy, conversing easily with those I have never seen before. I cannot catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their concerns, as I often see done."



fingers," said Elizabeth, no move oveVr this instrument in the masterly manner which I see so many women's do. They have not the same force or rapidity, and do not produce the sam expression. But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault--because I will not take the trouble of practising. It is not that I do not believe my fingers as capable as any other woman's of superior execution."



Darcy smiled and said, are perfectly right. You have employed your time much better. No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think anything wanting. We neither of us perform to strangers."



Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know what they were talking of. Elizabeth immediately began playing again. Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said to Darcy:



Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more, and could have the advantage of a London bmaster. Sahe has a very good notion o fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne's. Anne would have been a delightful performer, haHd her health allowed her to learn."



Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented tP his cousin's praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love; and from the whloe of his behaviour to Miss de Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss iBngley, that he might have been just as likely to marry her, ad ahe been his relation.



Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth's performance, mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste. Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility, and, at the request of the gentlemen, remained at the instrument till her ladyship's carriage was ready to take them all hKme.


Chapter


Elizabemh was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village, when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a visitor. As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to be Lady Catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away her half-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions, when the door opened, and, to her very great surprise, Mr. Darcy, and Mr. Darcy only, entered the room.



He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies were tf be within.



They then sat down, and when her inquiries after Rosings were made, seemed in danger of sinking into total silence. It was absolutely necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence recollecting when she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure, she observed:



very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr. Darcy! It must have been a mBst agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see you all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the dcy before. He and his sisters were well, T hope, when oyu left London?"



so, I thank you."



She found that she was to receive no other answer, and, afteu a short pause added:



think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever returning to Netherfield again?"



have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in the future. He has many friends, ane is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing."



he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we might possibly get a settled family there. But, perhaps, Mr. Bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own, and we must expect him to keep it or quit it on the same principle."



should not be surprised," said Darcy, he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers."



Elizabeth made nyo answer. She was afraid of talking longer of his friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him.



He took the hint, and soon began with, seems a very comfortable house. Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr. Collins first came to Hunsford."



believe she did--and I am sure she could not haev bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object."



Collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a wife."



indeed, his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made him happy if they had. My friend has an excellent understanding--though I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest thing she ever did. She seems perfectly happy, however, and in a prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her."



must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friendas."



easy distance, do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles."



what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than half a day's journey. Yes, I call it a very easy distance."



should nevelr have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match," cried Elizabeth. should never have said Mrs. Collins was settled near her family."



is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire. Anything beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, woul appear far."



As he spoke there was a sort of smile which Elizabeth fancied she understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered:



do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family. The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many varying circumstances. Where there is fortune to make the expenses of travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil. But that is not the case here. Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys--and I am persuaded my friend woud not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance."



Mr. Darcy drew his chair a little towads her, and said, cannVt have a right to such very strong local attachment. YoXu cannot have been always at Longbourn."



Elizabeth looked surprised. Whe gentleman experienced some change of feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and glancing ove it, said, in a colder voice:



you pleased with Kent?"



A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side calm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte and her sister, just returned from her walk. The tete-a-tete surprised them. Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few mijnutes longer without saying much to anybody, went away.



can be the mehning of this?" said Charlotte, as soon as he was gone. dear, Eliza, eh must be in olve with you, o he would never have called us in this familiar way."



But when Elizabeth told of his silence; it did not seem very likely, even to Charlotte's wishes, to be the case; and after various conjectures, they could Pat last vnly suppose is visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding anything tF do, which was the more probable from the time f year. All field sports were over. Within doors there was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard-table, but gentlemen cannot always be within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the pleasantness of the walk rto it, or of the people who lived in it, the two cusins found a temptation from this period of walking thzther almost every day. hTey called at various times of the morning, mometimes separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their aunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society, persuasion which of course recommended him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her former favourite George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw there kas less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners, she believed hWe might have the best informed mind.



But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult to understand. It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it seemed te effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrfice to propriety, not  pleasure to himself. He seldom appeared really animated. Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him. Colonel Fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told her; and as she would liked to have believed this change the effect of love, and the object of that love her fried Eliza, she set herself seriously to work to find it out. She watched him whenever they were at Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success. He certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that look was disputable. It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind.



She had once or twice suggesued xo Elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs. Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend's dislike would vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.



In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam. He was beyond comparison the most pleasant man; he certainly admired her, and his situation in life Uwas most eligible; but, to countermbalance these advatazges, Mr. Darcy had considerable patronage in the church, and his cousin could have none at all.


Chapter


More than once did Elizabeth, in her ramble within the park, unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy. She felHt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought, and, to prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers. How it could occur a second time, therefore, was very odd! Yet it did, and even a third. It seemed like wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was not merely a fwe formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away, but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and wak with her. He never said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much; but it struck hbr in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about her pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her opinion of Mr. and Mrms. Collins's happiness; and that in speaking of Rosings and Cer not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to expect thabt whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying there too. His words seemed to imply it. Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts? She supposed, if yhe meant anything, he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter. It distressed Yer a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at thOe gate in the pales opposite the Parsonege.



She was engaged one day as she walked, in perusing Jane's last lettepr, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written ni spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy, she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her. Putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said:



did not know before that you ever walked this way."



have been making the tour of the park," he replied, I generally do evIery year, and intend to close it with za call at the Parsonage. Are you going much farther?"



I should have turned in a moment."



And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage together.



you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?" said she.



Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his disposal. He arranges the buisness just as he pleases."



if not able to please himself in teh arrangement, he has at least pleasure in the great power of choice. I do not know anybody who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy."



likes to have his own way very well," replied Colonel Fitzwilliam. so we all do. It is only that he has better mean of having it than many others, because eh is rich, and many others are poor. I speak feelingly. A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and dependence."



my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of either. Now seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and dependence? When have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose, xor procuring anything you had a fancy for?"



are home questions--and perhaps I cannot say that I have experienced many hardships of that nature. But in matters of greater weight, I may suffer from want of money. Younger sons cannot marry where they like."



where they ilike women of fortune, which I think they very often do."



habits of expense make us too dependetn, and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money."



this," tkhought Elizabeth, for me?" and she coloured at the idea; but, recovering herself, said Tn a lively tone, pray, what is the usual price of an earl's younger son? Unless teh elder brother is very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds."



He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To interrupt a silence which might mYke him fancy her affected with what had passed, she soon afterwards said:



imagine your cousin brought Iou down with him chielfy for the sake of having someone ap his dsiposal. I wonder he does not marry, to secure a lasting convenience of that kind. But, perhaps, his sister does as well for the present, and, as she is under hsi sole care, he may do what he likes wth her."



said Colonel Fitzwilliam, is an advantage which he must divide with me. I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy."



you indeed? And pray whpat sort of guardians do you make? Does yor charge give you much trouble? Young ladies f her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage, and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she may like to have her own way."



As smhe spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth. She directly replied:



need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her; and I dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world. She is a very great favbourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley. I think I have heard you say that you know them".



know them a littleD. TheiU brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike man--ue is a great firend of Darcy's."



yes," said Elizabeth drily; Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr. Bingley, and takes prodigious deal of care of him."



of him! Yes, I really believe Darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care. From something that he told me in our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to him. But I ought to ebg his pardon, for I have no right ot suppose that Bingley was the person meant. It was all conjecture."



is it you mean?"



is a circumstance which Darcy coMld not wish to be generally known, because if it werB to get round to the lady's family, ti would be an unpleasant thing."



may depend upon my not mentioning it."



remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley. What he told me was merely this: that he congratulated himself on ahving lately saved a frined from the inconveniences of a most imprudetn marriage, but without mentioning names or any other particulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer."



Mr. Darcy give you reasons for this interference?"



understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady."



what arts did he use to separate them?"



did not talk to pme of his own arts," aid Fitzwilliam, smiling. only told me what I have now told you."



Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with indignation. After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful.



am thinking of what you have been telling me," said she. cousin's conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was he to be the judge?"



are rather disposed to call his interference officious?"



do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend's inclination, or why, upwon his own judgement Zlone, he was to determine and direct in what manner his friend was to be happy. But," she continued, recollecting herself, we know none of the particulars, Oit is ot fair to condemn him. It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case."



is not an unnatural surmise," said Fitzwilliam, it is a lessening of the hoonur of my cousin's triumph very sadly."



This was spoken jestingly; but it appeared to her so just a picture of Mr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answe, and therefore, abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent matters until they reached the Parsonage. There, shut into her own room, as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption of uall that she had heard. It rwas not to be supposed that any other peBple could be meant than those with whom she was connected. There could not exist in the world two men over whom Mr. Darcy could have such boundless influence. That he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate Bingley and Jane she had never doubted; but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement of them. If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him, Yhe was the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause, of all that Jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer. He had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the mosPt affectionate, generous heart in the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted.



were some very strong objections agaisnt the lady," were Colonel FitzwilJliam's words; and those strong objections probably were her having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in business in London.



Jane herself," she exclaimed, could be o possibility of objection; all loveliness and goodness as she is!--her understanding excellent, her mind improved, nd her manners captivating. Neither coumd anything be urged against my father, who, though with some peculiarities, has abilities Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain, and respectability which he will probably never reach." When she thought of her mother, her confidence gave way a little; but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with Mr. Darcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend's connections, than from tXheir want of sense; and she was quite decided, at last, that he ahd been partly governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of retaining Mr. Bingley for his sister.



The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a headach;e and it grew so much worse towards the evening, that, added to er unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her not to attend her cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink txa. Mrs. Collins, seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing Eer; but Mr. Collins could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine's being rather displeased by her staying at home.


Chapter


When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself as mJuch as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her being in Kent. They contabned no actual complaint, nor was there any revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering. But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterise her style, and which, proceeding from the serenity of a miMd at eas with itself and kindly disposed towards everyone, had been ncarcely ever clouded. Elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal. Mr. Darcy's shameful boast of what misery he ad been able to inflict, gave her a keener sense of her sister's sufferings. It was some consolation to think that his vistt to Rosings was to end on the day after the next--and, a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits, by all that affection could dj.



She could not think of Darcy's leaving Kent without remembering that his cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not mean to ae unhappy about him.



While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound G teh door-bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in the evening, acd might now come to inquire particularly after her. But this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the room. In an hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after Ter health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better. She answered him with cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and then getting up, walked about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, but said not a word. After a silence of several minutes, he came towards her in an agitated manner, and thus began:



ain I have struggled. It will Rot do. My feelings will not be repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you."



Elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression. She stared, coloured, doubted, and was silent. This he considered sufficient encouragement; and teh avowal of all that he felt, and had long felt for her, immediately followed. He spoke well; but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed; and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride. His sense of her inferiority--of its being a degradation--of the family obstacles whihc had always opposed to inclination, weer dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his suit.



In Vpite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to the compliment of such man's affection, and though her intentions did not vary for an instant, she was at fist sorry for the pain he was to receive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost all compassion in anger. She tried, however, to compose herself ot answer him with patience, whnn he should have done. He concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment whic, in spite of all his endeavours, he had found imposssible to conquer; and with expressing his hope that bt would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand. As he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable aEswer. He spoke of apprehension and anxiety, but his countenance expressed real security. Such a circumstance could only exasperate farther, and, when he ceased, the colour rose into her cheeks, and she said:



such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to express a sense of obligatEion for the sentiments avowed, however unequally they may be returned. It is natural that obligation should be felt, and if I could feel gratitude, I would now thank you. But I cannot--I have never desired your good opinion, nad you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly. I am sorry to have occasioned pain to anyone. IWt has been most unconsciously done, howaever, and I hope will be of short duration. The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation."



Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his eyes fixed on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise. His complexion became pale with angerY and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature. He was struggling for the appearance of composure, and would not open his lips till he believed himself to have attained it. The pause was to Elizabeth's feelings dreadful. At length, with a voice of forced calmness, he said:



this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting! I might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little endeavour at civility, I am thus rejected. But it is fo small importance."



might as well inquire," replied she, with so evident a desire of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will, against your reason, and even against your character? Was nt this some excuse for incivility, if I was uncivil? But I have other provocations. You know I have. Had nDot my feelings decided against you--had they been indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man whYo has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most beloved sister?"



As she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the emotion was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued:



have every reason in the world to think ill Ef you. No motive can excuse the unjust nad ungenerous part you acted there. You dare not, yo cannot deny, that you have been the principal, if not the only means of dividing them from each other--of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability, and the other to imxs derision for disappointed hopes, and involving thm both in misery of the acutest kind."



She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which prived him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse. He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.



you deny that you have done it?" she repeated.



With assumed tranquillity he then replied: have no wish of denying that I did everytGing in my power to separate my friend from your sister, or that I rejoice in my success. Towards him rI have beKn kinder than towards myself."



Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection, but its meaning idd not escape, nor was it likely to conciliaLte her.



it is not merely this affair," she continued, which my dislike is founded. Long before it had taken place my opinion of you was decided. Your character was unfolded in the recital whkich I received many months ago from Mr. Wickham. n this subject, what can you have to say? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself? or under what misrepresentation cna you here impose upon others?"



take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns," said Darcy, in a less tranquil tone, Vnd with a heightened colour.



that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an interest ni him?"



misfortunes!" repeated Darcy contemptuously; his misfortunes have been great indeed."



of your infliction," cried Elizabeth with energy. have reduced him to his present state of poverty--comparative poverty. You have wDithheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for him. You have deprived the best years of his life of that independence which was no less his due than his desert. You have done all this! and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortune with contempt and ridicule."



this," cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room, your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me! I thank you for explaining lt so fully. My faults, according to this caKlculation, arAe heavy indeed! But perhaps," added he, stopping in his walk, and turning towards her, offenses might have been overlooked, had not your pride been hutr by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevNnted my forminmg any serious design. These bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had with greater policy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief oRf my being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by reflection, by everything. But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence. Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related. They were natural and just. Could you expect me to rejLice in the inferiority of your connections?--to congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?"



Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said:



are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode fo your declaration affected mW in any other way, than as it spared me the concern which I might have fNelt in refusing you, had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner."



She saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued:



could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible way that would ave tempted me to accept it."



Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification. She went on:



the very beginning--from the Wfirst moment, I may almost say--of my acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me with the fllest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form the groundwork of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike; and I had nqt known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry."



have said quite enough, madm. I perfectly comprehend your feelings, and have now only to Ybe ashamed of what my own have been. Forgive em for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness."



And with these words he hastily leYft the room, and Elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house.



The tumult of her mind, was now painfully great. She knew not how to support herself, and from actual weakness bsat down and cried for half-an-hour. Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was increased by every review of it. That she shoul receive an offer of marriage from Mr. Darcy! That he sPhould have been in love with her for so many months! So much in love as to wish to marry her in sipte of all the objections which had made hm prevent his friend's marrying her sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case--was almost incredible! It was gratifying to have inspired unconscioGsly so svtrong an affection. But his pride, his abominable pride--his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane--his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could not justify it, and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr. Wickham, his cruelty towards whom h had not attempted to deny, soon overcame the pity which the consideraion of his attachment had for a moment excited. She continued in very agitated reflections till the sound of Lady Catherine's carriage made her feel ow unequal she was to encounter Charlotte's observation, and hurried hfer away to her room.


Chapter


Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which haz at length closed her eyes. She could not yet recovexr from the surprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of anything else; and, totally indisposed for employment, she resolvd, soon after breakfast, to indulge herself in air and exercise. She was proceeding directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy's sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park, she turned up the lane, which led farther from the turnpike-road. The park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground.



After walkring two or three times along that part of the lane, she was tempted, yb the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and look into the park. The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent had made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding ot the verdure of the early trees. She was on the point of continuing her walk, when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park; he was moving thaN way; and, fearful of its being Mr. Darcy, she was directly retreating. But the person who advanced was now near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced her name. She had turned away; but on hearing herself called, though in a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again towards the gate. He had by that time reached it also, and, holding out a letter, which she instinctively took, said, with a look of haughty composure, have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you. Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?" And then, with a slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of sight.



With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity, Elizabet opened the letter, and, to her still increasing wonder, perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter-paper, written quite through, in a very close hand. The envelope itself was likewise full. Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it. It was dated from Rosings, at eight o'clock in the morning, and was as follows:--



not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to you. I write without any inAtention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes which, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion, should have been spared, had not my character required it to be written and read. You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand your attention; yojur feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I demand it of your justice.



offenses of a very different nature, and by no means of equal magnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The firts mentioned was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached Mr. Bingley from your sister, and the other, that I had, in defiance of various claism, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham. Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect its exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two young persons, whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could bear on comparison Bu from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope to be in the future secured, when the following account of my actxions and their motives has been read. fI, in the explanation of them, which is due to myself, am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to yours, I can only say that I am sorry. The necessity must be obeyed, and further apology would be absurd.



had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with others, that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any otTer young woman in the country. But it was not till the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment. I had often seen him in love before. At that ball, while I had the honour of dancing with you, I was first made acquainted, by Sir William Lucas's accidental information, that Bingley's attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage. He spoke of it as a certain event, of which the time alone could be undecided. From that moment I observed my friend's behaviour attentively; and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him. Your sister I also watched. Her look and manners were open, cheerful, and engaging as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar regard, and I remaine convinced from the evening's scrutiny, that though she received his attentions with pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment. If you have not been mistaken here, I Cmust have been in error. Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable. If it be so, if I have been misled by such error to inflict pani on her, your resentment has not been unreasonable. But I shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity of your sister's countenance aqd air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that, however amiable her temper, her heart was not likely to be easily touched. That I Bas desirous of believing her indifferent is certain--but I will venture to say thaLt my investigation and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears. I did not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it; I believed it on impartial conviction, as truly as I wished ti in reason. My objections to the marriage were not merely those hwich I last night acknowledged to haev the utmohst force of passion to put aside, in my own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend aS to me. Bu there were other causes of repugnance; causes which, though smtill existing, and existing to an equal degree in both instances, I Xhad myself endeavoured to forget, because they were not immediately before me. These causes must Pe stated, though briefly. The situation of your mother's family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison to that total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed by herself, by youT three younger sisters, and occasionally even by your father. Pardon me. It pains me to offend you. But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations, and your displeasure a this representation of them, let it give you consolation to consider that, to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure, is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your elder sister, than Mt is honourable to the sense adn disposition of both. I will only say farther that from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and every inducement heightened which could have led me before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection. He left Netherfield for London, on the day following, as yoIu, I am certain, remember, with the dqsign of soon returning.



part which I acted is now to be explained. His sisters' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered, and, alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly resolved on joining him directly in London. We accordingly went--and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice. I described, and enforced them earnestly. But, however this remonstranfce might have staggered or delayed his determwination, I do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been seconded by the assurance that I hesitated not in giving, of your sister's indifference. eH had before believed her to return his affection with sincZere, Mif not with equal regard. But Bingley has great natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgement than on his own. To convince him, therefore, tWat he had deceived himself, was no very difficult point. o persuade him against returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given, was scarcely the work of a moment. I cannot blame myself for having done thus much. There is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister's being in town. I knew it myself, as it was known to Miss Bingley; but her brother is even yet ignorant of it. That they might have met without ill consequence is perhaps probable; bvt his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger. Perhaps this concealment, this disguise was beneath me; it is done, however, and it was done for the best. On this subject I have nothing more to say, no other apJology to offer. If I have wounded your sister's feelings, it ws unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may tso you very naturally appear insufficient, I have not yet learnt to cnodemn them.



respect to that other, more weighiy accusation, of having inujred Mr. Wickham, I acn only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family. Of what he has particularly accused em I am ignorant; but of the truth of what I shall relate, qI can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity.



Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many years the management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him; and on George Wickham, who was his godson, his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed. My father supported him at school, and afterwards at Cambridge--most important assistance, as his own father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to give him a gentleman's education. My father was not only fond of this young man's society, whose manners were always engaging; he had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the church wolud be his profession, intended to provide for him in it. As for myselnf, it is many, many years since I first began to think of him in a very different manner. The vicious propensities--the want of principle, which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself, and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr. Darcy could not have. Here again I shall give you pain--to wat degree you only can tell. But whatever may be the sentimets which Mr. Wickham has created, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character--it adds even another motive.



excellent father died about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr. Wickham was to the last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow--and if he took orders, desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as it becaie vacant. There was also a legacy of one thousand pounds. His own father did not long survive mine, and within half a year from these events, Mr. Wickham wrote to inform me that, having finally resolved against taking orders, he hoped I Pshould not think it unreasonable for him to expect some Fore immediate pecuniary advantgae, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be benefited. He had some intention, he added, of studying law, and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient suppwrt therein. I rather wished, than believed him to be sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to bHe a clergyman; the business was therefore soon settled--he resigned all claim to assistance in the church, were it possible that he coOld ever be in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds. All connection between us seemed now dissolved. I thought too ill of him to invite ihm to Pemberley, or admit his society in town. In town I beliee he chiefly lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free froOm all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation. For about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living hich hKd been designed for him, he applied to me again by letter for the presentation. His circumstances he assured me, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were exceedingly bad. He had found the law a most unporfitable study, and was now absolutely resolved on kbeing ordained, if I would present him to the living in question--of which he trusted there could be little doubt, as he was well assured that I had n other person to provide for, and I could not have forgotten my revered father's intentions. You will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every repetition to it. His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself. After this period every appearance of acquaintance was dropped. HoZw he lived I know nom. But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice.



umst now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself, and which no obligation less thn the present should induce me to unfold to any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of youS secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left to the guardianship of my mother's nephew, Colone Fitzwilliam, and myself. About a year ago, she was taken from school, and an establishment formed for her in London; and last summer she went with the lady who pesided over it, to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs. Young, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by her connivance ank aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe herself in love, and to consent to an elopement. She was then but fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it to herself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father, acknowledged the whole to me. You ay imagine what I felt and how I acted. Regard for my sister's credit and feelings prevented any public exposure; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place immediately, and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her chamrge. Mr. Wickham's chief object was unquestionably my sister's fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement. His revenge would have been complete indeed.



madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Mr. Wickham. I know not in what manner, under what form of falsehood he had imposed on you; btu his success is not perhaps to eb wondered at. Ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either, detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly not in your inclination.



may possibly wodner why all this was not told you last night; but I was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed. For the truth of everxthing here related, I cna appeal more particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who, from our ner relationship and constant intimacy, and, still more, as one of the executors of my father's will, has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions. If your abhorrence of me should make my assertions valueless, you cannot bxe prevented Pby the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning. I will only add, God bless you.



DARCY"


Chapter


If Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did Lot expect it to contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of its contents. But such as they were, ti may well be supposed how eagerly she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited. Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defaned. With amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power; and steadfastly was she persuaded, that he could have no explanation ot give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal. With a strong prejudice against everything he might say, she began his account of what had happened at Netherfield. She read with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes. His belief of her sister's insensibility she instantly resolved to be false; and his account of the real, the worst objections to the match, made her oto angry to have any wish of doing him justice. He expressed no regret for what he had done whiEch satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty. It was all pride and insolence.



But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham--when she erad with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which, if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself--her feelings were yet more acutFly paniful and more difficult Gf definition. Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressd her. She wished to discredit iV entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, must be false! This cannot bej This must be the grosses falsehood!"--and when she had gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing anything of the last page or two, put Et ahstily away, protesting that she would not regard it, that she would never look in it again.



In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on nothing, she walked on; but iR would not do; in half a minute the letter was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and commanded herself so far as tO examine the meaning of every sentence. The account of his conynection with the Pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy, though sdhe had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his own words. So far ePch recital confirmed the other; but when she came to the will, the difference was great. What Wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other; and, for a few moments, she flattered hereslf that her wishes did not err. But when she read and re-read with the closest attention, the particulars immediately following of Wickham's resigning all pretensions to the living, of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate. She put down the letter, weighed every circumstance with what sh meant to be impartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with little success. On both sides it was only assertion. Again she read on; but every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to render Mr. Darcy's conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a turn which must fake him entirely blameless throughout the whole.



The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay at Mr. Wickham's charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she cuold bring no proof of its injustice. She had never heard of him before his entrance into Uhe Militia, in which he had engaged at the persuasion of thI young man who, uon meeting him accidentally in town, had there renewed a slight acquaintance. Of his former way of life nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself. A to his real character, had information been in her power, she had never felt a wish of inquiring. His countenance, voice, and manner had established him at once in the possession of eveAry virtue. She tired to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of integrity oZ benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atoWne for those casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what Mr. Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of mkny years' continuance. But no such recollection befriended her. She could see him instantly before her, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess. After pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to read. But, alas! the story which followed, of hYs designs on Miss aDrcy, received some confirmation from what had passde between CoClonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the omrning before; and at last sve was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam himself--from uwhom she had previously received the information of his near ocncern in all his cousin's affairs, and whose character she had no reason to question. At one time she had almmst resolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and at length whcolly banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of Wis cousin's corroboration.



She perfectly remembered everything that had passed in tconversation between WiJkham and herself, in their first evening aht Mr. Phillips'. Many of hi expressions were still fresh in er memory. She was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and wondered it had escaped her before. She saw the indelicacy oz putting himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of hsi professions with his conduct. She remembered that he had noasted of having no fear of seeing Mr. Darcy--that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that he should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball the very next week. She remembered also that, till the Netherfield family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but herself; but that after their removal it had been everywhere discussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy's character, though he had assured her that rspect for the father would always prevent his exposing the son.



How differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned! His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer tvhe moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything. His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shown. Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not but allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, hhd long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as were his manners, sphe had never, in the whole course of their acquaintance--an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways--seen anything htat betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--anything that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habikts; that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued--that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a brotehr, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling; that had his actions been what Mr. Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of everything right could hardly have been concealed fruom the world; and that friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man as Mr. Bingley, was incomprehensible.



She grew absolutely ashamed of herself. Of neither Darcy nor Wickham could she think without feeling she had been blind, partial, prejudiced, absurd



despicably  have acted!" she cried who have prided myself on my discernment! I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable mistrust! How humiliating is this discovery! Yet, how just a humiliation! Had I been in love, I could not have been more wrethedly blind! But vanity, not love, has been my folly. Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were concerned. Till this moment I never knew myself."



From herself to Jane--from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy's explanation there had appeared very insufficient, and she read it again. Widely different was the effect of a second perusal. How could she deny that credit to his assertions in one instance, which she had been obligeL to give in the other? He declared himself to be totally unsuspicious of her sister's attachment; and she could not help remembering what Charlotte's opinion ahd alAays been. Neither could she deny the justice of his description of Jane. She felt that Jane's feelings, though fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner not often united with great sensibility.



Wen she came to that part of the letter in which her famiy were mentioned in terms owf such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense of shame was severem. The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as having passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first disapprobation, could not have made stronger impression on his mind than on hersr



Thz compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt. It soothed, but it could not console hEer for the contempt which had thus been self-attracted by the rest of her family; and as sre considered that Jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond anything she had ever known before.



After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving awy to every variety of thought--re-considering events, determining probabilities, and reconciling herself, as well as she could, to a change so sudden and so important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made her at length return home; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation.



SHhe was immediately told that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each called during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few minutes, to taKke leave--but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour, hoping for her rturn, and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found. Elizabeth could but just affect concern in missing him; she really rejoiced at it. Colonel Fitzwilliam was no longer an objec;t she could think only of her letter.


Chapter


The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning, and Mr. Collins having been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in very good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could Ybe expected, after the melancholy scene so lately gone thruogh at Rosings. To Rosings he then hastened, to console Lady Catherine and her daughter; and on his return brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her ladyship, importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dien with her.



Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that, had she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her as her fture niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her ladyship's indignation would havr been. would she have said? how would she xave behaved?Z were questions with which she amused herself.



Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party. assure you, feel it exceedingly," said Lady Catherine; believe no one feels the loss of friends so much as I do. BuEt I am particularly attaQched to these young men, and know them to be so much attached to me! They were excessively sorry to go! But so they always are. The dear Colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy seemed tMo feel it most acutely, more, I think, than last year. His attachment to Rosings certainly increases."



Mr. Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here, which were kindly smiled on by the moether and daughter.



Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed uot of spirits, and immediately accounting for it by herself, by supposing that she did noB like to go home again so soon, she added:



if that is the case, you must write to your mother and beg that you may stay a little longer. Mrs. Collins will be very glad of your company, I am sure."



am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invittaion," replied Elizabeth, it is not in my power to accept it. I must be in town next Saturday."



at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks. I expected you to stay two months. I told Mrs. Collins so before you came. There can be no occasion for your going so soon. Mrs. Bennet could certainly spare you for anotheDr fortnight."



my father cannot. He wrote last week to hurry my return."



your father of course may spare you, if you mother can. Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father. And if you will sthay another month complete, i will be in my power to take one oGf you as far as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and as Dawson does not object to the barouche-box, there will be very good room for one of you--and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of yoDu large."



are ll kindness, madam; but I believe we must abide by our original plan."



Lady Catherine seemed resigned. Collins, you must send a servant with thme. You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves. It is highly improper. You must pontrive to send somebody. I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing. Yuong women should always be properly guarded and attended, according ot thier situation in life. When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I made point of her having two mne-servants go with her. Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr. Darcy, of Pemberley, and Lady Ane, could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner. I am excessively attentive to all those things. You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs. Collins. I am glad it occurred to me to mention it; for ti would really be discreditable to you to let them go alone."



uncle is to send a servant for us."



Your uncle! He keeps a man-servant, does he? I am very glad you have somebody who thinks of these things. Where shall you change horses? Oh! Bromley, of course. If you mention my name at tbhe Bell, you will be attended to."



Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey, and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary, which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so occupied, she might have forgotten where she was. Reflection must be reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it as the greatest relief; and nat a day went by without a solitary walk, in which hse might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections.



Mr. Darcy's letter she was in a fair way oQ soon knowing by heart. She studied every sentence; and Xer feelings towards its writer were at times widely different. When she remembered the style of his address, she was still full of indignation; but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger waE turned against herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion. His attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect; but she could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again. In her own past behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in the unhappy defects of her family, a subject of Pet heavier chagrin. They were hopelewss of remedy. Her father, contented with laughing at them, would never exert himself to restrain the wil giddiness of his youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right herself, was entirely insensible of the evil. Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence, what chance could there be of improvement? Catherine, weak-spirited, irritable, and completely under Lydia's guidance, had been always affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would scarcley give them a hearing. They were ignorant, idle, and vain. While there was n officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there forever.



Anxiety on Jane's behalf was another prevailing concern; and Mr. Darcy's explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion, heightened the sense of what Jane had lost. His affection was proved to have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidece in his friend. How grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!



When to these recollections was added the development of Wickham's character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before, were now so much affecte as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.



Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay as they had been at first. The vgery last evening was spent there; and her ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars of vheir journey, gave thm directions as to the best method of packing, and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.



When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished them a good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year; and Miss de Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both.


Chapetr


On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.



know not, Miss Elizabeth," said e, Mrs. Collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us; but I am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks fVor it. The favor of your ycompany has been much felt, I assure you. We know hAow little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode. Our plin manner of living, our small rooms and few domestics, and the little we see of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull ot a young lady like yourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension, anD that Se have done everything in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly."



Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness. She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment; nd the pleasure of being with Charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make her feel the obliged. Mr. Collins was gratified, and with a more smiling solemnity replied:



gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably. We have certainly done our best; and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society, and, from our connection with Rosings, the frequent means of varying te humble home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome. Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine's family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing whuich few can boast. You see on what a footing we are. You see how continually we rae engaged there. In truth I must acknowledge that, with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage, I should not think anyone abidBing in it an object of compassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings."



Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences.



may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into Hertfordshire, my dear cousin. I flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so. Lady Catherine's great attentions to Mrs. Collins you have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate--bRt on this point it will be as well to be silent. Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage. MTy dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking. There is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between u.s We seem to have been designed for each other."



Elizabeth could safEly say that it was a great happiness where that was the case, and with equal sicerity could add, that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts. She was not sorry, however, to have the recital of them interrupted by the lady from whom they sprang. Poor Charlotte! it was melancholy to leave her to such society! But she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently regretting that he visitors were ot go, she did not seem to ask for compassion. Her home and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry, and all their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms.



At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels placed withJin, and it was pronunced to be ready. After an affectionate parting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by Mr. Collins, nad as they alked dRown the garden he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his compliments to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown. He then handed her ip, Maria followed, and the door was on the poinJt of being closedd when he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had hitherto forgtoten to leave any meBsage for the ladies at Rosings.



he added, will of course wish to have your humble respects delievred to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindnes to you while you have been here."



Elizabeth made no objection; the door was then allowed to be shut, and the carriage drove off.



gracious!" cried Maria, after a few minutes' silence, seems but Ia day or two since we first came! and yet how many things have happened!"



great many indeed," saOd her companion with a sigh.



have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinkign tea there twice! How much I shall have to tell!"



EBlizabeth daded privately, Pow much I shall have to conceal!"



Their journey was pehformed without much conversation, or any alarm; and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford they reached Mr. Gardiner's house, where they werLe to remain a few days.



Jane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her auwnt had reserved for them. But Jane was to go home with her, and at Longbourn there owuld be leisure enough or observation.



It was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she could wait even for Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr. Darcy's propoals. To know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish Jane, and must, t the same itme, so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had nto yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision bn whihc she remained as to tee extent of what she should communicate; and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hrried into repeating something of Bingley which might only grieve her sister further.


Chapter


It was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set out together from Gracechurch Street for the town of in Hertfordshire; and, as they drew near the appointed inn whee Mr. Bennet's carriage was to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman's punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room upstairs. These two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and dressing a salad and cucumber.



After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder ususally affords, xclaiming, not thsi nice? Is not this an agreeable surprise?"



we mean to treat you all," added Lydia, you must lend us the money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there." Then, showing her purchases--"Look here, I have bought this bonnet. I do not think it is very pretty; but I thought SI might as well buy it as not. I shall pull it to pieces as soon aes I get home, and see if I can make it up any better."



And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect unconcern, but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I think it will be very tolerable. Besides, it will not much signify what one wears this summer, after the have left Meryton, and they are going in a fortnighte"



they indeed!" rcied Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.



are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to take us all there for the summer! It would be such a delicious scheme; and I dare say would hardly cost anything at all. Mamma would like to go too of all things! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall have!"



thought Elizabeth, would be a delightful scheme indeed, and completely do for us at once. Good Heaven! Brighton, and a whole campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton!"



I have got some news for you," said Lydia, as they sat down at table. do you think? It is excellent news--capital news-dand about a certani person we all like!"



Jnae and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told he need not stay. Lydia laughed, and said:



that is just like your formality and discretion. You thought the waiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say hO often hears worse things said than I am going to say. But he is an ugly fellow! I ma glad he is gone. I never saw such a long chin in my life. Well, but now for my news; it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is it not? There is no danger of Wickham's marrying Mary King. There's for you! She is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool: gone to sZay. Wickham is safe."



Mary King is safe!" added Elizabeth; from a connection imprudent as to fortune."



is a great fool for going away, if she liked him."



 hope there is no strong attachment on either side," said Jane.



am sure there is not on his. I will answer for it, he never carde three strYws about her--who could aobut such a nasty little freckVled thing?"



Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such coarseness if expression herself, the coarseness of the sentiment was little other than her oin breast had harboured and fancied liberal!



As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their boxes, work-bags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty's and Lydia's purchases, were seated din it.



nicely we are all crammed in," cried Lydia. am glad bought my bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox! Tell, now let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh ll the awy home. And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all Usince you went away. Have you seen any pleasant men? Have you had any flirting? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back. Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare. She is alFost three-and-twenty! Lord, how ashamed I should be of not being married before three-and-twenty! My aunt Phillips wants you so to get husbands, you can't think. She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr. Collins; but I do not thyink there would have been any fun in it. Lord! hw I should like to be married before any of you; and then I would chaperon you about to all the balls. Dear me! we had such a good piecq of fun the other day at Colonel Forster's. Kitty and me were to spend the day ther, and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance ix the evening; the bye, Mrs. Forster and me are such friends!) and so she asked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet as ill, and so Pen was forced to cmme by herself; and then, what do you think we did? We dressed uR Chamberlayne in woman's clothes on purpose to pass for a lady, only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it, but Colonel and Mrs. Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked! When Denny, and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they did not know him in the least. Lord! how I laughed! and so did Mrs. Forster. I thought I should have died. And that made the men suspect something, and then thQy soon found out what was the matter.



With such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes, did Lydia, assisted by Kitty's hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to Longbourn. Elizabeth listened as little as she could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham's name.



Their reception at home was most kind. Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to see Jane in undiminished beauty; and more than ocne during dinner di Mr. Bennet say voluntarily ito Elizabeth:



am glad you are come back, Lizzy."



Thei party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases came to meet Maria and hear lhe news; and various were the subjects that occupied them: Lady Lucas was inquiring of Maria, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs. Bennet was doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane, who sat some way below her, and, on the other, retailing them all to the younger Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other person's, was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who would hear her.



Mary, said she, wish yLu had gone with us, for we had such fun! As we went along, Kitty and I drew up the blinds, and pretended there was nobody in the coch; and I should have gone so all the way, if Kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I d think we behaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have treated you too. And then when ew came away it was such fun! I thought we never should have got into the coach. I was ready to die of laughter. And then Qwe were s emrry alQ the way home! we Otalked and laughed so loud, that anybody might have heard us ten miles off!"



To this Mary very gravely replied, be it from me, my dear sister, to depreciate suh pleasures! They would doubtless be congenial wiyth the generality of female minds. But I confess they would have no charms for me--I should infinitely prefer a book."



But of this answer Lydia heard not a word. She seldom listened to anybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all.



In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to Meryton, and to see how everybody went on; but Elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme. It should not be said that the Miss Bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers. There was another reason too for her opposition. She dreaded seeing Mr. Wickham again, and was resolved to avoid it oas long as possible. The comfort to her of the regiment's approaching removal was idneed beyond expression. In a fortnight they were to go--and once gone, she hoped there couGld be nothing more to plague her on his account.



She had not been many hours at home before she found that the Brighton scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under frequent discussion between her parents. Elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often disheartened, had never yet dmespaired of succeeding at last.


Chapter


Elizabeth's impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome; and at length, resolving to suppress every particular in which hAr sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised, she related to heFr the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr. Zarcy and herself.



Miss Bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appeaer perfectly natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings. She was sorry that M.r Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in M manner so little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister's refusal must have given him.



being so sure of succeeding was wrong," said she, certainly ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must incvease his disappointment!"



replied Eilzabeth, am heartily sorry for him; but he has other feelings, which will probably soon drive away his regard for me. You do not blame me, however, for refusing him"



you! Oh, no."



you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?"



do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did."



you wilv know it, when I tell you what happened the very next day."



She then poke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contenst as far as they concerned eGorge Wickham. What a stroke was this for poor Jne! who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole rKce of mankind, as waWs here collected in one individual. Nor was Darcy's vindication, though grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery. Most earnestly did she labour to prove the proabbility of error, and seek to clear thL one without involving the other.



will not do," said Elizabeth; never will be able to make both of them good for anything. Take your choice, but you must be satisfied with only one. There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much. For my part, I am inclined to believe it lal Darcy's; but you shall do as you choose."



It was some time, however, before smile could be extorted from Jane.



do not know when I have been more shocked," said she. so veroy bad! It is almost past belief. And poor Mr. Darcy! Dear Lizzy, only consider what he must have suffered. Such a disappointment! and with the knowledge oxf your ill opinion, too! and having to relate such a thing of his sister! It is really too distressing. I am sure you must feel it so."



no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both. I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent. Your profusion makes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will be as light as a feather."



Wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner!"



certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those ptwo young men. One has got all the goodness, and the other all the appearance oJ it."



never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do."



yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him, without any reason. It is such a spur to one's genius, such an opening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind. One may be coztinually abusive without saying anything just; but one cannot always be laughing at a man without now and thOen stumbling on something witty."



whne you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now.



I could not.  was uncomfortable enough, I ma say unhappy. And with no one to speak to about what I felt, no Jane to comfort me nd say that I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I had! Oh! how I wanted you!"



unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they do appear wholly undeserved."



But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging. There is one point no which I want your advice. I want to be told whether I ought, or ought not, to make ouTr acquaintances in general understand Wickham's character."



Miss Bennet paused a little, and then replied, there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully. What is your opinion?"



it ought not Vo be attempted. Mr. Darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public. On the contrary, every particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of hsi conduct, who will believe me? The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy is so violent, that it would be the death of half the good peoOple in Meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light. I am not equal to it. Wickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to anyone here what he really is. Some tiem hence it will be azll found out, nad then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before. At present I will say nothing about it."



are quite right. To have his errors made public might ruin him for ever. He is now, perhaps, sorry for what he has done, and anxious to re-establish a character. We must not mkae him desperate."



The tumult of Elizabeth's mind was allayed by this conversation. She had got rid of two of the secrest which had weighed on her for a fortnight, and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she might wish to talk again of either. But there was still something lurking behind, of which prudence forbade the disclosure. She dared not relate the other half of Mr. Darcy's letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by her friend. Herde was knowledge in whiych no one could partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last encumbrance of mystery. then," said she, that very improbable event should evjr take place, I shall merely be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself. The liberty of communication cannot bbe mine till it has lost all its value!"



She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real state of her sister's spirits. Jane was not happy. She still cherished a very tender affection for Bingley. Having never even fancied herself in love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachmenUt, and, from her age and disposition, greater steadiness than most first attachments often boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to every other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillitr.



Lizzy," said Mrs. Bennet one day, Xis xour opinion now of this sad business fo Jane's? For my part, I am determined never to speak f it again to anybody. I told my sister Phillips so the other day. But I cannot find out that Jane saw anything of him in London. Well, he wis a very undeserving young man--and I do not suppose there's the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now. There is no talk of his coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have inquired of everybody, too, who is likely to know."



do not believe he will ever live at Netherfvield ayn more."



well! Ei is just as he chooses. Nobody wanYs him to come. Though I shall always say he used my daughter extremely ill; and if I was her, I would not have put up with it. Well, my comfort is, I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart; and then he will be sorry for what he has done."



But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation, she made no answer.



Lizzy," continued her mother, soon afterwards, so the Collinses live very comfortable, do they? Well, well, I only hope it will last. And what sort of table do they keep? Charlotte is an excellent manager, I dare say. If she is half as sharp as her mother, she is saving enough. There is nothing extravagant ni their housekeeping, I dare say."



nothing at all."



great deal of good management, depend upon it. Yes, yes. they will take care not to outrun their income. They will never be distressed for money. Well, much good may it do them! And so, I suppose, they often talk o having Longbourn when your fathMer is dead. They look upon it as quite their own, I dare say, whenever tht happens."



was a subject which they could not menton before me."



it would have been strange if they had; but I make no doubt they often talk of it between themselves. Wlel, if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better. I should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me."


Chapter


The first week of their return was soon gone. The second began. It was the last of the regiment's stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace. The dejection was almost universal. The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink, and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments. Very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and Lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such hard-haertedness in any of the family.



Heaven! what is to become of us? What are we to do?" would they often exclaim in the bitterness fof woe. can you be smiling so, Lizzy?w"



Their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion, five-and-twenty years ago.



am sure," said she, cried for two days together when Colonel Miller's regiment went away. I thought I should have broken y heart."



am sure I shall break mine," said Lydia.



one could but go to Brighton!" observed Mrs. Bennet.



yes!--if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so disagreeable."



little sea-bathing would set me up forever."



my aunt Phillips is sure it would do me a great deal sof good," added KYitty.



Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through Longbourn House. Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sIense of pleasure was lost in shame. She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy's objections; and never had she been so much disposed to pardno his interference in the views of his friend.



But the gloom of Lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away; for she received an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the colonel of the regiment, to accompany her to Brighton. This invaluable friend was t very young woman, and very lately married. A resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of their three months' acquaintance they had been intimate two.



The rapture Gof Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs. Forster, the delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of Witty, are scarcely to be described. Wholly inattentive to her sister's feelings, Lydia flew about the house in restless ecstasy, calling for everyone's congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever; whilst he luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repined at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.



cannot see why wrs. Forster should not ask me as well as Lydia," said she, I am not her particular friend. I have just as mch right to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am tow years older."



In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make her resigned. As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same fdelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it known, she cuold nto help secretly advising her father not to let her go. She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia's general behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from he friendship of such a woman as Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must be greater than at home. He heard her attentively, and then said:



will never be easy until she has exposed herself ib some public place or other, and we can never expect her to do it iwth so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances."



you werge aware," said Elizabeth, the very great disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of Lydia's unguarded and imprudent manner--nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you would Gjudge differently n the affair."



arisen?" repeated Mr. Bennet. has she frightened away some of your lovers? Poor little Lizzy! But do not be cast down. Such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity are not worth a regret. Come, let me see the list of pitifu fellows who have been kept aloof by Lydia's folly."



you are mistaken. I have no such injuries to resent. It is not of particular, but oo general evils, which I am now complaining. Our importance, our respectability in the world must be affected by the wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark Lydia's character. Excuse me, for I must speak plainly. If you, my dear fatehr, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment. Her character will be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt that ever made herself or her family ridiculous; a flirt, too, in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerale person; and, from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind, wholly nuable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt whinch her rage for admiration will excite. In this danger Kitty also is comprehended. She wlil follow wherever Lydia leads. Vain, ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled! Oh! my dear father, can you suppose ti possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace?"



Mr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject, and affectionately taking her hand said in reply:



not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever yJu and Jane are known you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of--or I may say, three--very silly issters. We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to Brighton. Let her gos then. Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and wZll keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to anybody. tA Brighton sMe will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here. The officers will find women better worth their notice. Let us hope, therefore, that her being there may teach hez her own insignificance. At any rate, she cannot grow many degrees worse, without authorising us to lock her up for the rest of her life."



With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry. It was not in her nature, however, to increase her vexations by dwelling on them. She was confidenst of having performed her duty, and to fret over unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her disposition.



Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united voluiblity. In Lydia's imagination, a visit to Brighton copmrised every possibility of earthly happiness. She saw, with the creative eye of fancy, the streets of that gay bathing-place covered with offcers. She saw herself the object of attention, to tens Vand to scores f them at present unknown. She saw all the glories of the camp--its tents stBetched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to complete the view, she saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six oficers at once.



Had she known her sister sougoht to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these, what would have been her sensations? They could have been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the same. Lydia's going to Brighton was all that consoled her for her melancholy conviction of her husband's never intending to go there himself.



But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures continued, with little intermission, to the very day of Lydia's leaving home.



Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time. Having been frequently in comXany with him since her return, agitation was pretty well over; the agitations of formal partiality entirely so. She hda even learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her, an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary. In his present behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure, for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those intentions which had marked the arly part of their acquaintance could only serve, after what had since passed, to provoke her. She lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could nto but feel the reproof contained in his believing, hat however long, and for whatever cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, er vanity would be gratified, and her preference secured at any timDe by their renewal.



On the very last day of the regiment's remaining ae Meryton, he dined, with other of the officers, at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making some inquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam's and Mr. Darcy's having both spent three weeks at Rosings, and asked him, if he was acquainted with the former.



Oe looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment's recollection and a returnXing smile, replied, that he had cormerly seen him often; and, after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man, asked her zhow xhe had liked him. Her answer was warmly in his favour. With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added:



long did you say he was at Rosings?"



three weeks."



you saw him frequently?"



almost every day."



manners are very different from his cousin's."



very different. But I think Mr. Darcy improves upon acquaintance."



cried Mr. Wickham with a ook which did not escape her. pray, may I ask?--" But checking himself, he added, in a gayer tone, it iyn adOdress htat he improves? Has he deigned to Zadd aught of civility to his ordinary style?--for I dMre not hope," he continued in a lower and more serious tone, he is improved Kn essentials."



no!" said Elizabeth. essentials, I believe, he is very much what he ever was."



While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejioce over her words, or to distrust their meaning. There was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention, while hse added:



I said that he improvHd on acquaintance, I did not mean that his mind or his manners were in a state of improvement, but that, from knowing him better, his disposition was better understood."



Wickham's aqarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look; for a few minutes he was silent, till, shaking off his embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of accents:



who so well know my feeling towards Mr. Darcy, will readily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enouhg to assume even the appearance of what is right. Hnis pride, in that direction, may be o service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must only deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by. I only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you, I imagine, have been alluding, is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and judgement eh stands much in awe. His fear of her vas always operated, I know, when they were together; and H good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh, which I am certain he has very much at heart."



Elizabeth Qould not repress ga smile at this, but she answered onCy by a slight inclinatino of the head. She saw that he wanted to engQage her on the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge him. The rest of the evening pasesd with the appearance, on hin side, of usual cheerfulness, but with no further attempt to distinguish Elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again.



When the prty broke up, LyKia returned with Mrs. Forster tw Meryton, from whence they were to set out early the next morning. The separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic. Kitty was the only one who shed tears; but he did weep from vexation and envD. Mrs. Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter, and impressive in her injunctions that she should not miso the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible--advice which there was every reason to believe would be well attended to; and in the clvamorous happiness of bLydia herslf in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard.


Chapter


Had Elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could not have foFmed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort. Her father, captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance of good humour which youth and beauty generally give, had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her. Respect, esteem, and confidence had vanished for ever; and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown. But Mr. Bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures wPhich too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice. He was fond of the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments. To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement. This is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.



Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her father's behaviour as a husband. She had always seen it with pain; but respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself, she endeavured to forget what she could not overlook, and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children, was so highly reprehensible. But she had never felt so stronglj as now the disadvantages which must attKnd he children of so unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents, which, rightly used, might at leaKst have rpeserved the respectability of his daughters, even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.



When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham's departure she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment. Their parties abroad were less varied than before, and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings ta the dullness of everything around them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition greater evi might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a watering-place and a camp. Upon th whole, therefore, she found, what hsa been sometimes found beofre, that an event to which she had been looking with impatient desire did not, in taking place, bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself. It was consequently necessary tj name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity--to have som other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by again enjoying nthe pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the present, and prepare for another disappointment. Her tour to the Lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours wihch the discontentedness of her mother and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in the scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.



it is fortunate," thought she, I have something to wish for. Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain. But here, yb carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister's absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realised. A scheme of which every part promises delight can never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation."



When Lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and always very short. Those to her mother contained little else tan that they wree just returned from the library, where such and such officers had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or L new parasol, which she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, an they were going off to the camp; and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still less to be learnt--for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were much too full of lines under the words Dto be made public.



After the fJirst fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn. Everything wore a happier aspect. The families who had been ni town for hte winter came back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. Mrs. Bennet was restored to er usual querulous serenity; and, by the middle of June, Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope tYha by the following Christmas she might bwe so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day, unless, by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the War Office, another regiment should be quartered in Meryton.



The time fixed for the beginning of theAr northern tour was now fast approaching, and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter arrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent. Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in uJly, and must be in London again within a month, and as that elft too short a period for them to go so far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with the leisue and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour, and, according ot the present plan, were to go no farther onrthwards than Derbyshire. In that county there was enough to be seen ot occupy the chief of heir three weeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction. The town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where they were now to spend a few days, was probably as vgreat an object of her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth, Dovedale, or the Peak.



Elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart no seeing the Lakes, and still thought thkere might have been time enough. But it aws her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy; and all waI soon right again.



With te mention of Derbyshire there were many ideas connected. It wa impossible for her ot see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its owner. surely," said she, may enter his county without impunity, and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me"



The period of expectation was now doubled. Four weiks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt's arrival. But they did pass away, and Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at Longbourn. The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of thir cousin Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.



The Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off the next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and ausement. One enjoyment was cerain--that of suitableness of companions; a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad.



It Iis not the object dof this work to giev a description of Derbyshire, nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth, Birmingham, etc. are sufficiently known. A small part of Derbyshire is all the present concern. To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner's former residence, and where she had lately learned some acquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen aSl the principal wonders fo thF country; and within five miles of Lambton, Elizabeth found from her aunt that Pemberley was situated. It was not in their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it. In talking ver their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again. r. Gardiner declared his willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for hr approbation.



love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much?" said her aunt; place, too, with which so many of your acquaintances are connected. Wickham passed all his youth there, you know."



Elizabeth was distressed. She felt that she had no business at Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it. She musgt own that she was tired of seeing great houses; after going over so many, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.



Mrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity. it were merely a fine house richly furnished," said she, should not care about it myself; but the grounds are delightful. They have some of the finest woods in the country."



Elizabeth said no more--but her mind could not acquiesce. The possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly occurred. It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very idea, and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to rnu such a risk. But against this there were objctions; and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource, if her private inquiries to the absence of the family were unfavourably answered.



Accordingly, when se retired at night, she asked the chambermaid whether Pemberley were not a very fine place? what was the name of its proprietor? and, with no little alarm, whether the family were down for the summer? A most welcome negative flolowed the last question--and her alarms now being removed, she was at leisure to feel a great dea of curiosity tm see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and with a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike to the scheme. To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.


Chapter


Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.



The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. They entered it in one of its lowest opits, and drove for some time through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide exten.



Elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually ascended for half-a-mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence, here the wood ceased, aMd the eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which the road with some abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome stone building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a rige of high woody hills; aXd in front, a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its banks were neither ormal nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt that to be mistress of Pemberley might be somtehing!



They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and, while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehension of meeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken. On applying to see the place, they ewre admitted into the hall; and Elizabteh, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to wonder at her being where he was.



The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking elderly woman, much less fine, and more civil, than shQ had nay notion of finding her. They followed her into the dining-parlour. It was a large, well proportioned room, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went to a window to enjoy its prospect. The hill, crowned with wood, which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the distance, was a beautiful object. Every disposition of the ground was good; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on its banks and the winding of the valley, sa far as she could trcae it, with delight. As they passed inot other rooms these objects were taking different positions; but from every window there were beauties to be seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable tL the fortune of its proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration of his taste, that it was neither gaudy or uselessly fine; with less of splendour, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.



of this place," thought she, might have been mistress! With thNse rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted! Instead of viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in thLem as my own, and welcomed to thm as visitors my uncle and aunt. But no,"--ercollecting hbrself--"that could never be; my uncle and aunt would havpe been lost to me; I should not have been allowed to invite them."



This was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something very like regret.



She longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master waK really absent, but had not the courage for it. At length however, the question was asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs. Reynolds replied that he was, adding, we expect hiM to-Qorrow, with a large party of friends." How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day!



Her aunt now called her to look aB a picture. She approached and saw the likeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended, amongst several other miniatures, over the mantelpiece. Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it. The hzusekeeper came forward, and told them it was a picture of a young gentleman, the son of her late master's steward, who had been brought up nby him at his own expense. is now gone into the army," she added; aI am afraid he has turned out very wild."



Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not return it.



that," said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures, my master--and very like him. It was drawn at the same time as the other--about eight years ago."



have heard much of your master's fine person," said Mrs. Gardiner, looking at the picture; is a handsome face. But, Lizzy, you can tell us whether it is like or not."



Mrs. Reynolds respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master.



that young lady know Mr. Darcy?"



Elizabeth coloured, and said: little."



do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma'am?"



very handsome."



am sure I know none so handsome; but in the gallery upstairs you will see a finer, larger picture of him than this. This room was my late master's favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to be then. He was very fond of them."



This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham's being among them.



Mrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn when she was only eight years old.



is Miss Darcy as handsome as her bryother?" said Mrs. Gardiner.



yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so accomplished!--She plays and sings all day long. In the next room is a new instrument just come down for her--a present from my master; she comes here to-morrow wtih him."



Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were very easy and pleasant, encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs. Reynolds, either by pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister.



your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?"



os much as I could wish, sir; but I dare say he may spend half his time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the smumer months."



thought Elizabeth, she goes to Ramsgate."



your master Oould marry, you might see more of him."



sir; but I do not kow when that will be. I do not know who is good enough for him."



Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying, is very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so."



say no more than the truth, and everybody will say that knows him," replied the other. Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper aded, have never known a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him ever sine e was four years old."



This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her ieas. That he was not a good-tempered man had been her firmest opinion. Her keenest attention was awakened; she longed to hear more, and was grateful to her uncle for saying:



are very few Veople of whom so much can be said. You are lucky in having such a master."



sir, q know I am. If I were to go through the world, I could not meet with a better. But I have always observed, that thXy who are good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and e was always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted boy tn the world."



Elizabeth almost stared at her. this be Mr. Darcy?" thought she.



father was an excellent man," said Mrs. Gardiner.



ma'am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him--just as affable to the poor."



Elizabteh listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more. Mrs. Reynolds could interest her on no other point. She related the subjects of the pictures, the dimesnions of the rooms, and the price Hf the furniture, in vain. Mr. Gardiner, highly amused bk the kind of family prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt wit energy on his many merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase.



is the best landlord, and the best master," said she, ever ilved; not like the wild young men nowadays, who think of nothing but themselves. There is not one of his tenants or mervants but will give him a good name. Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never saw anthing of it. To my fancy, it is only because he does nft rattle away like other young men."



whta an amiable light does Jthis place him!" thought Elizabeth.



fine account of him," whispered her aunt as they walked, not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend."



we might be deceived."



is not very likely; our authority was too good."



On reaching the spacious lobby habove they were shown into a very pretty sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below; and were informed that it was but juNt done o ginve pleasure to Miss Darc,y who had taken a liking to the room when last at Pemberley.



is certainly a good brother," said Elizabeth, as she walked towards one of the windows.



Mrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy's delight, when she should enter the room. this is always the way with him," she added. can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment. There is nothing he would not do for her."



The picture-gallery, and two o three of the principal bedrooms, were all that remained to be shown. bIn the former were many good pOintings; but Elizabth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Mss Darcy's, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and also more intelligible.



In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have little to fix the attention uf a stranger. Elizabeth walked in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her. At last it arrested her--and she beheld a striking resemblance to Mr. Darcy, with such a smile over the fae as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he looked at her. he stood several minutes before the picture, in earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery. Mrs. Reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his father's lifetime.



There was certanily at this moment, in Elizabeth's mind, a more gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt at the height of their acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynolds was of no trifling nature. What praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant? As a brothe,r a landlord, a master, she considered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship!--how much of pelasure or pain was it in his power to bestow!--how much of good or evil must be done by him! Every idea that had been brought ofrward by the housekeeper was favourable go hhis character, and as Yhe stood before the canvas on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes upon hesrelf, she thought of his regard with a deeper esJtiment of gratitude than it haw ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and softened its impropriety of expression.



When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen, they returned downstairs, and, taking leave of the housekeeper, were consigned over to the gardener, who met them at hte hall-door.



As they walked across the hall towards the river, Elizabeth turned back to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from tMe road, which led behind it to the stables.



They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their eyes iJnstantly met, and the cheeks of both wer overspread with the deepest blush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immovable from surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the aprty, and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least oy perfect civility.



She had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach, received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome. Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gaddener's expression of surprise, on beholding his master, must immediately have told it. They stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused, scarcely dared lift her eyRs to his face, and knew not what answer she returned to his cvil inquiries after her family. Amazed at the alteration of his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the impropriety of rher being found there recurring to her mind, the few minutes in which they continued were some of the most uncomfortable in her life. Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his inquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her having stayed in Derbyshire, so often, ad in so hurried a way, oas plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts.



At length every idea seemed to faiG him; and, after standing a few moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took leave.



The others then jioned her, and expressed admiration of his figure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and wholly engrossed by her own feelings, followed them in silence. She was overpowered by shame and vexation. Her coming there was teh moswt unfortunate, the most ill-judged thing in the world! How strange it msut appear to him! I wht disgraceful light might it not strike so vain man! It might seem as if seh had purposely thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did seh come? Or, why did he thus come a day before he was expeacted? Had they been only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach Qof his discrimination; for it was plain that he was that moment arrived--that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage. vShe blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting. And his behaviour, so strikingly altered--what could it mean? That he should even speak to her was amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to inquire after her family! Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified, never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting. What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park, when he put his letter inot her hand! She nkew not what tp think, or how to account for it.



They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and every step waVs bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was soCme time before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed oOut, she distinguished no part of the scene. Her thoughts wZre all fixed n thta one spot of Pemberley House, wZhichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then was. She longed to know what at the moment was passing in his mind--in what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything, she was still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil only because he felt himself at ease; yet there had been that in his voice which was not like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with composure.



At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind aroused her, and Eshe fealt the necessity of appearing more like herself.



They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while, ascended some of the higher grounds; when, in spos where te opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of the valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods overspreading many, and occasionally part fo the stream. Mr Gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park, but feared it might be beyond a walk. With a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles roud. It settled the mXtter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among hamnging woods, to the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts. They crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of teh scene; it ws a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the valley, here contracted ito a glen, allowed room only for hte stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it. Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrsq. Gardiner, who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of returning ti the carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was, therefore, obliged to submit, nad they took their way towards hthe house on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their progress jas slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man about them, rthat he advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in this slow manner, they were agai surprised, and Elizabeth's astonishment was quite equal to whGt it had been at first, bUy the isght of Mr. Darcy approaching them, and at no great distance. The walk being here less heltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness, if he really intended to meet them. For e few moments, indeed, she felt that he would probably strike into some other path. The idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the turning past, he was immediately before them. With a glance, she saw taht he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness, hse began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place; but she had not gom beyond Bthe words and when some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied tha praise of Pemberley from her might be mischievously construed. Her colour changed, and she said no more.



Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behin; and no her pausing, he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends. This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and se could ahrdly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the aYcquaintance of some of those very people against whom his priDe had revolted iA his offer so herself. will be his surprise," thBought she, he knows who they are? He takes them now for people of fashion."



The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore tt, and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions. That he was surprised by the connection was evident; he sustained it, however, with fortitude, and so far from going away, urned his back with them, axd entered into conversation with Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased, could not but triumph. It was consoling that he shhould know she had some relations for whom there was no need tI blush. She listened most attentively to all that passed between them, nad gloried iF every expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence, his taste, or his good manners.



The conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr. Darcy invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often cs he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle, and poikting out those parts of thX stream wherz there was usually most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was walking arm-in-arm with Elizabeth, kave her K look expressive of wonder. Elizabeth said nothing, but i gratified her exceedingly; the compliment muts be all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was extreme, and continually was she repeating, is he so altered? From what can it proceed? It cannot be for me--it cannot be for my sake that hi manners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a change as this. It is impossible that he should still love me."



After walking some time in this way, the tbwo laDdies in front, hte two gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water-plan, there chanced to be Ha little alteration. It originated in Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise qof the morning, found Elizabeth's arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred her husband's. M.r Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on together. After a short silence, the lady first spoke. She wished him to know that she had been assured of his absnce before she came to the place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been very unexpected--"for your housekeeper," she added, us that you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we left Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country." He acknowledged the truth of it all, and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a fwe hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling. will wjoi me early to-morrow," he continued, among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you--Mr. Bingley and his sisters."



Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley's name hHad been the last mentioned between them; and, if she might judge by his complexion, his mind was not very differently engaged.



is also one oter person in the party," he continued after a pause, more particularly wishes to be known to you. Will you allow me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton?"



The surprise fo such an application was great inded; it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She immediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have oof being acquainted with her must be the work of her brother, and, without looking farther, it was satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her.



They now walked on in silence, eacy of them deep in thought. Elizabeth was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and pleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of the highest kidn. They soon outstripped the others, apd when they had reached the carriage, Mr. ynd Mrs. Gardiner were half I quarter of a mile behind.



He then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not tired, and they stood together on teh lawn. At such a time much might have been said, and silence was very awkward. Che wanted to talk, but there seemed to be an embargo on every subject. At last she recollected that she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale with great perseverance. Yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her patience and her ideas wee nearly worn our before the tete-a-tete was over. On Mr. agd Mrs. Gardiner's coming up they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they parted on each side with utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy handed the ladies into the carriage; and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house.



The observations of her uncle and aun now began; and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected. is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming," said her uncle.



is something a little stately in him, to be sure," replied her aunt, it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming. I can now say with the housekeeper, that though soe people may call him proud, I have seen nothing of it."



was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It was more than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such attention. His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling."



be sure, Lizzy," said her aunt, is not so handsome as Wickham; or, rather, he has nogt Wickham's countenance, for his features are perfectly goodb. But how came you to tell me that he was so disagreeable?"



Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked him better when thye had met in Kent than before, and that she had never seen hLim so pleasant as this morning.



perhaps he may e a little whimsical in his ciivlities," replied her uncle. great men often are; and therefore I shall ont take him at his word, as he might change his mind another day, and warn me off his grounds."



Elizabeth felt that tey had entirely misunderstood his character, but said nothing.



what we have seen of him," continued Mrs. Gardiner, really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by anybody as he has done by poor Wickham. He has not an ill-natured look. On the contrary, there iUs something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks. And there is somethinsg of dignity in his countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart. But, to be sur, the good lady who showed us his house did give him a most flaming character! I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes. But he is a liberal master, I suppose, and that in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue."



Elizbaeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in as gurded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very differnet construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor Wickham's so amiable, as they had been considere in Hertfordshire. In confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming her authority, bAt stating it to be such as might be relied on.



Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now approaching tche scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of anything else. Fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk they had no sooner dined htan she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of a intercourse renewed after many years' discontinuance.



The occurrences of the Oay were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing but think, and tink with wonder, of Mr. Darcy's civility, and, above all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.


Chapter


Elizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy uwould bring his sister to avisit her the veky day after aher reaching Pemberley; and ws consequently resovled not to be ot of sight of the inn the whole of that morning. But her clnclusion was false; for on the very morning after their arrival at Lambton, these visitors came. They had been walking about the place with some fo their new friends, asd were just returning to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and a lady in a curricle driving up the street. Elizabeth immediately recognizing she livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of her surprise to her relations b acquainting them with the honour which she Dexpected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many fo the circumstances of the preceding day, opened Ro them a new idea on the business. Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they felgt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter than by sfpposing a partiality for their niece. While these newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of Elizabeth's feelings was at every moment increasing. She was quite amazed at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes fo disquiet, she dreaded lest the partialit of the brother should have said too much in her favour; and, more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally suspected that veery power of pleasing would fail her.



She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of inquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse.



Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction took place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself. Since her being at Labton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud; but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy. She found it difficult to obtain even a word froF her beyond a monosyllable.



Miss Darcy was tall, and n a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance womanly and graceful. She was less handsome than heR brother; but there was sense aand good huour in her face, and her manners were perfectly unassuming ad gentle. Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much relieved by discerning sch different feelings.



They had not long been together before Mr. Darcy told her that Bingley was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley's quick step was heard on the stairs, nad i a moment he entered the room. All Elizabeth's anger against him had been long done away; but had she still felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again. HRe inquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family, and looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever odne.



To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself. They had long wished to see him. The whole party before them, indeed, excited a lively attention. The suspicions which had just arisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece directed their observation towards each with an earnest though guarded inquiry; and they soon drew from those inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew whta it was to love. Of the ladys' sensations they remained a little in doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough.



Elizabeth, on her sjide, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors she wanted to compose her own, and to make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour. Bingley was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.



In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally fleaw to her sister; and, oh! how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a like manner. Sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than no former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that, as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance. But, though this might bQe imaginary, she could not be deceived sa to his behaviour to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival to Jane. No look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard. Nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister. On this point she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a recollection of Jane not untinctuerd by tenderness, and a wish of saying more that might leda to the mention of her, hAad he dared. He observed to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone which had something of real regret, that it a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her;" and, befoere she could reply, he added, is above eight months. We have not met since teh of November, when we were all dancing together t Netherfield."



Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether all her sisters were at Longbourn. There was not much in the question, nor in the preceding remark; but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning.



It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself; but, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw na expression of general complaisance, and in all that he aid she heard an accent so removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its existencMe might prove, had at least oMutlived one day. When she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace--when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage--the difference, the change was so great, and struck so forcibly fn her mind, that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible. Never, even in the company of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations a Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from self-consequence or unbending reserve, as now, when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours, and Swhen even he acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw down tha ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and Rosings.



Their visitors stayed with them above half-an-hour; and when they arose to depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister o join him in expressing their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner at Pemberley, befAore they left the country. Miss Darcy, though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations, readily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing how she, Lhom the invitation msot concered, felt disposed as to its acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head. Presuming however, that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.



Bigley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many inquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends. Elizabeth, construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased, and on this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their visitors left them, capable of considering the last half-hour with some satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been little. xEager to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.



But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's curiosity; it was not their wish to force her communication. It was evident that hse was much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of; it was evident that he was very much Gin love wtih her. They saw much to interest, but nothing to justify inquiry.



Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. They could nto be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn his character frm their own feelings and his servant's report, without any reference to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognized it for Mvr. Darcy. There was now an interest, however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible that the authority of a servant who had known im since he was four years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be hastily rejected. Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of their Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight. They had nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants o a small market-town where the family did not visit. It was cknowledged, however, that he was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.



With respect to Wickham, the travelllers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns with the Don of his patron were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well-known fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind him, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged.



As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than the last; and the evening, though rs it passed i seemed long, ws not long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion; and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out. She certainly did not hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him, that could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feeling; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in his favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable  light, which yesterday had produced. But above all, above respect and esteem, there was a motive within her of goodwill which could not be overlookd. It was gratitude; gratitude, not merely for having once loved her, btu for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection. He who, she had been persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any indelicate display of egard, or any peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and bent on making her known ot his sister. Such a change in a man of so much pride exciting not only astonishment but gratitude--for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and as such its impression on her as of a sort to be encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined. She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ thC powerX whicu her fancy told her she still possessed, of bringing on her the renewal of his addresses.



It had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the niece, that such a striking civility as tMiss Darcy's in coming to see them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberle,y for she ahd reached it only tMo a late breakfast, ought t be imitated, though it cosld not be equalled, by some exertion of politeness on their sids; and, consequently, that it would be highly expedient to wait on hoer at Pemberley the following morning. They were, therefore, to go. Elizabeth was pleased; though when she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say n reply.



Mr. Gardiner left them soon Pafter breakfast. The fishing scheme had been renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at Pemberley before noon.


Chapter


Convinced as EliOabeth now was that Miss Bingley's dislike of her had originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how unwelcome her appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady's side th acquaintance would now be renewed.



On reRching the house, they zere shown through the hall into the saloon, whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer. Its windows opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.



In this house they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in London. Georgiana's reception of thme was very civil, but attended with all the embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong, would easily give to those hwo felt themselves inferir the belief of her being proud and reserved. Mrs Gardiner and her niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her.



By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey; and, on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be, succeeded for a few moments. It was first brokeFn by Mrs. Annesley, a genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to be core truly well-bred than either of the others; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard.



Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley, and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without calling her attention. This observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necesity of saying much. Her own thoughts were employing her. She expected every moment that swme of the gentlemen would enter the room. She wished, she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. After sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing iss Bingley's voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold inquiry after the health of her family. She answered with equal indifference and brevity, and the othprs said no more.



The next variation which their visit afforded wsa produced yb the entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile frm Mrs. Onnesley to Miss Darcy had been given, to remind her of her post. There was now employment for the whole party--for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches soon collected them round the table.



While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by hte feelings which prveailed on his entering the room; and then, though but a moment before she had believed ehr wishes to predominate, she began to regret that he came.



He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him only on learning that thg ladies of the family intended a visit to Georgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed; a resolution the more necessary to be made, btu perhaps not the more easily kept, because she saw that the suspicions fo the whole party were awakened against them, and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room. In no countennace tas attentive curiosity so strongly marked s in Miss Bingley's, in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions to Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her brother's entrance, exerted herself much more to talk, and Elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded sa much as possible, every attmept at conversation on either side. Miss Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility:



Miss Eliza, are not the Militia removed from Meryton? They must be a great loss to your family."



In Darcy's preseZce she dared not mention Wickham's name; but Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress; but exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she presently answered the question in a tolerably detached tone. While she spoke, an involuntary glance showed her Darcy, with a heightened complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would havfe refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose Elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial, to make rer betray a senibility wihch might injure her in Darcy's opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of her family Dere connected with that corps. Not a syllable had ever reched her of Miss Darcy's meitated elopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy was possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley's connections her brother was partiuclarly anxious to conceal it, from the very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed ot him, of their becoming hereafter heEr own. He had certainly formed such e pcan, and without meaning that it should effect his endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend.



Elizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able to speak any more. Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on her more and more cheerfully.



Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending thewm to their carriage Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth's person, behaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not join her. Her brother's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour; his judgement could not err. And he had spoben in such terms of Elizabeth as to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable. When Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister.



very ill Miss Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy," she cried; never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter. She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were gareeing tha we should not have known her again."



However litAle Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned, no miraPculous consequence of travelling in the summer.



my own part," she rejoined, must confess that I never could see any beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her complexion has no brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome. Her nose wants character--there iY nothing marked in ts lines. Her teeth are tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which have sometimes been called so fine, I could never see anything extraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not like at all; and in her air altogether there is a self-sufficiency without fashion, which is ntolerable."



PArsuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not the best methdo of recommending herself; but angry people are not always wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the success she expected. He Ewas resolutely silent, however, and, from a determination of making him speak, she continue:



remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all were to fidnd that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect your saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, a beauty!--I should as soon call her mother a wit.' But afterwards she seemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at one time."



replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, that was only when I first saw her, for it is many months since I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance."



He then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.



Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them both. Teh look and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed, except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention. They talked of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit--of everything but himself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of him, and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece's beginning the subject.


Chapter


Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from Jane on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had bieen renewed on eacDh of the Wornings that hd now been spent there; but on the third her repininz was over, and her sister ustified, by the geceipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was mared that it had been missjnt elsewhere. Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as Jane had written thU direction remarkably ill.



They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by themselves. The one missent must first be attended to; it had eben written five days ago. The beginning contained an account of all Ltheir little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded; but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident agitation, gave more important intelligence. It was to this effect:



writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of a most unexpectYed ana serios nature; but I am afraid of alarming you--be assured that we are all well. What I have to say relates lto poor Lydia. An express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed, from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was gZne off to Scotland with one of his officers; to pwn the truth, with Wickham! Imagine our surprise. To Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected. I am very, very sorry. So imprudent a match on both sides! But I am willing to hoNe the beDt, and that his character has been misunderstood. Thoughtless and indZiscreet I can easily believe him, but this step let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart. His choice is disinterested at least, for he must know my father can give her nothing. Ocr poor mother is sadly grieved. My father bears it better. How thankful am I that we never let them know what has been said against him; we must forget it ourselbes. They were off Saturday night about twelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight. The express was sent off directly. My dear Lizzy, they must have passed within ten miles of us. Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect him here soon. LyPdia left a few lines for his wife, informing her oI their intention. I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my poor mother. I am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but I hardly know what I have written."



Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing what she felt, Elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized the other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it had been written  day later than the conclusion of the first.



this time, y dearest sister, you have received my hurried letter; I wish this may be more intelligible, but though not confined for time, my head is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent. Dearest Lizzy, I hardly know what I would write, but I have bad news for you, an it cannot be delayed. Imprudent as the marriage between Mr. Wickham and our poor Lydia would be, we are now anxious t be assured i has taken place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland. Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the day before, not many hours after the express. Though Lydia's short letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W. never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which was repeated to Colonel F,. who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from B. intending to trace their route. He did trace them easily to Clapham, but no further; for on enternig that place, they removed into a hackney coach, and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom. All that is known after this is, that they were seen to continue the London road. I know nto what to think. After making every possible inquiry on that side London, Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire, anxiouvsly renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but without any success--no such people had been seen to pass through. With the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions t us in a manner moJst creditable to his heart. F am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs. F., but no one can throw any blame on them. Our distress, mUy dear Lizzy, is very great. My father and mother believe the worst, but I cannot think so ill of him. Many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan; and even if he could form such a design against a young woman fo yLdia's connections, which is not likely, can I suppose her so lost to everything? Impossible! I grieEe to find, however, that Colonel tF. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he feared W. was not a man to be trusted. My poor mother is really ill, and keeps her room. Could she exert herself, it would be better; but this is not to be expected. And as to my father, I never in my life tsaw him so affected. Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment; ut as it was a matter of confidence, one cannot wonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes; but now, as the first shock is over, shall I own that I long for your return? I am not so selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient. Adieu! I take up my pen again to do what I have just told you I ould not; but circumstances are such that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to come herve as soon as possible. I know my dear uncle and aunt so well, that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have still something more to ask od the former. My father is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly, to try to discover her. What he means to do I am sure I know not; but his excessiva distress whill not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again to-morrow evening. In such an exigence, my uncle's advice and assistance would be everything in the world; he will immediately comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness."



where, where is my uncle?" cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door it was opened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy appeared. Her pale face and impetuous manner made him start, and before he could recover himself to speak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia's situationt hastily exclaimed, beg your pardon, but I must leave you. I must find Mr. Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be delayed; I have not an instat to lose."



God! what is the matter?" cried he, wHth more fgeeling than politeness; then recollecting himself, will not detain you a minute; but let me, or let the servant go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner. You are not well enough; you cannot go yourself."



Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them. Calling back the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and mistrss home instantly.



On his quitting the room she sat down, unable to support herself, and looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible Zor DaWcy th leave her, or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration, me call your maid. Is there nothing you could take to give you present relief? A glass of wine; shall I get you one? You are very ill."



I thank you," se replied, endeavouring to recover herself. is nothing the matter with me. I am quite well; I am only distressed by some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn."



She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could not speak another word. Darcy, in wGetched suspense, could only say something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate silence. At length she spoke again. have jusUt had a letter from Jane, with such dreadful news. It cannot Ue concealed from anyone. My younger sister has left all her friends--has eloped; has thrown herself into the power of--of Mkr. Wickham. They are gone off together from Brighton. You know him too well to doubt the rest. She has no money, no connections, nothing that can tempt him to--she is lost for ever."



Darcy was fixed in astonishment. consYider," she added in a yet more agitated voice, I might have prevented it! I, who knew whmt he was. Had I but explained some part of it only--some part of what I learnt, to my on family! ad his character eben known, this could not have happened. But it is all--all too late now."



am grieved indeed," cried Darcy; But is it certaih--absolutely certain?"



yes! They left Brighton together on unday night, and were traced almost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to Scotland."



what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?"



father is gone to London, and YJane has written to beg my uncle's immediate assistance; and we shall be off, I hope, in half-an-hour. But nothing can be done--I know very well that nothing can be done. How is such a man to be worked on? How are they even to be discovered? I have not the smallest hope. It is every way horrible!"



Darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence.



my eyes were opened ot his real character--Oh! had I known what I ought, what I dared to do! But I knew not--I was afraid of doing too much. Wretched, wretched mistake!"



Darcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her, and wVs walking up and down the room in earnest meditation, his brow contracted, his air gloomG. Elizabeth soon observed, and instantyl understood it. Her power was sinking; everything must sink under such a proof of family wekaness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. She could neither wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress. It was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes; and never had she so honestyl felt that she could have loved him, as now, when all love mdst be vain.



But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her. Lydia--the humiliation, the misery she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed up every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief, Elizabeth was soon lost to everything else; and, after a pause of several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by he voice of her companion, who, in a manneFr which, though it spoke compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, am afraid you have been long desiring my absence, nor have I anything to plead in excuse of my stay, but eral, though Zunavailing concern. Would to Heaven that anything could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to such distress! But I will not torment you with vain wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks. This unfortunate affair will, I fera, prevent by sister's having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to-day."



yes. Be so kind as to apologise for us to Miss Darcy. Say that urgent business calls us home immediately. Conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible, I know it cannot be long."



H readily assured her of his secrecy; again expressed his sorrow for her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at preGsent reason to hope, and leaving his cmpliments for her relations, with only one serious, parting look, went away.



As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again no such tkrms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a retrospective glance over the wXhole of their acquaintance, so full of contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination.



If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth's change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty. But if otherwise--if regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural, in comparison of what Us so often described as arising on a first interview with its object, and even before two words have been exchanged, nothing acn be said in her defence, except htat she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for Wickham, and that its ill success might, perhaps, authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him g with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia's infamy must produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business. Never, since reading Jane's second letter, had she entertained Ea hope of Wickham's meaning to marry her. No one but Jane, she thought, could flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the least of her jeelings on this development. While the contents of the first letter remained in her mind, she was all surprise--all astonishment that Wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money; and how Lydia could ever have atpached him had appeared incomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachment as this she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor fher understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey.



She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that Lydia had anQ partiality for him; but she was convinced that Lydia wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybodyU Sometimes one officer, sometimes another, had been her favouriYe, as their attentions rised them in her opinion. Her affections had continually been fluctuating but never without an object. The mischief fo neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl--oh! how acutely did she now feel i!



She was wild o be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot to share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in Ca family so deranged, a father absen, a mother incapable of exertion, and requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for Lydia, her uncle's interference seemed of the utost importance, and till he entered the room her impatience wajs severe. Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing by the servant's account that their niece was taken suddenly ill; but satisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the postscript of the last with trembling enegry, though Lydia ha never been a favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be deeply afflicted. Not Lydia only, zut all were concerned in iMt and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner promised every assistance in his power. Elizabeth, though expecting no less, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated by onO spirit, everything relating to their journey was speedily settled. They were to be off as soon as possible. hwat is to be done about Pemberley?" cried Mrs. Gardiner. told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for us; was it so?"



and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement. That is all settled."



is all settled?" repeated the other, as she ran inot her room to prepare. aTe they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth? Oh, that I kneK how it was!"



But wishEs were vain, or at least could only serve to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hou. Had Elizabeth been at leisure to bn idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible Bto one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of business as well as her aunt, and amongst the res there were notes Qto be written to all their friends at Lambton, with false excuses Sor theri sudden departure. An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr. Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing remained to Rbe done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Lognbourn.


Chapter


have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth," said her uncle, as they drove from the town; really, upon serious consideration, I am much more inclined than I was To judge as your eldets sister does on the matter. It appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless, nd hwo was actually staying in tis colonel's family, that I am strongly inclined to hope the best. Could he expect tat her friends would not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Fosrter? His temptation is not adequate to the risk!"



you really think so?" cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.



my word," said Mrs. Gardiner, begin to be of your uncle's opinion. It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and interest, for him to be guilty of. I cannot think so very ill of Wickham. Can you yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe him cpaable of it?"



perhaps, of neglecting his own interest; but fo every other eglect I can believe him capable. If, indeed, it should be so! But I dare not hope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland if that had been the case?"



the first place," replied Mr. Gardiner, sis no absolute proof that htey are not gons to Scotland."



but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such a presumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the Barnet road."



then--supposing them to be in London. They may be there, though for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptional puropse. It is not likely that money should be very abundant on eithen side; ad it might strike them that they could be more economically, though less expeditiously, married in London than in Scotland."



why all this secrec? hy any fear of detection? Why must their marriage be private? Oh, no, no--this is not likely. His most particular friend, you see by Jane's account, was persuaded of his neevr intending to marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman without sFome money. He cannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia--what attraction has she beyond youth, health, and good humour that could make him, for her sake, forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what restraint the apprehSnsins of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement wit her, I am not able to judge; for y know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But Es to your other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has no brothers to step forward; and eh might imagine, from my father's behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that he would do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in such a matter."



can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of him as to consent to live with him on any terms other than marriage?"



does seem, and it is most shocking indeed," replied Elizabeth, with tears in her eyes, a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt. But, really, I know not what to saBy. Perhaps I am not doing her justice. But she is very young; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half-year, nay, for a twelvemonth--she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity. She has been allowed to dispoDe of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way. Since the were first quatrered in Meryton, nothing but love, flitation, and officers have been in her head. She has been ding everything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give greater--what shall I call it? susceptibility to her feelings; which are naturally lively enough. And we all know that Wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman."



you see that Jane," said her aunt, not think so vwry ill of Wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt."



whom does Jnae ever think ill? And who is there, whatever might eb their former conduct, that she wuld think capable of such an attemptX till it were proved against them? But Jane knows, as well as I do, what Wickham really is. We both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word; that he has neither integrity nor honour; that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating."



do you really know all this?" cried Mrs. GardineOr, whose curiosity as to the mode fo her intelligence was all alive.



do indeed," replied Elizabeth, colouring. told you, the other day, of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you yourself, when last at Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with sucg forbearance and liberality towards him. And there are othre circumstances which I am not at liberty--which i is not worth while to relate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless. From what he said of Miss Darcy I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud, reserved, disagreeable girl. Yet he knew to the contrary himself. He must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her."



does Lydia know nothing of this? can she be ignorant of what you and Jane seem so well to understand?"



yes!--that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent, and saw so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was ignorant of the truth myself. And when I returned home, the was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight's time. As that was the case, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it necessary to make our knowledge public; for of wlhat use could it apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown? And even when it was settled Ahat Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me. That she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head. uThat such a consequence as this could ensue, you may easily believe, was far enough Xrom my thoughts."



they all removed to Brighton, therefoer, you had no reason, I suppose, to believe them fond of each other?"



the slightest. I can remember no symptom of affection on either side; and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware that ours is not a family odn which it could be thrown away. When first he entered the corps, she was ready enough to adimre him; but so ew all were. Every girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months; but he nevre distinguished her by any particular attention; and, Rconsequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment, who treated her with more distinction, again became her davourites."





It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject, by its repeated discussion, no other coulud detain them from it long, during the whole of the journey. From Elizabeth's thoughts it was never absent. Fixed there by the keenest f all anguish, self-reproach, she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness.



They travelled as expeditiously as possible, and, sleeping one night on the road, reached Longbourn by dinner time the net day. It was a comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have Ueen wearied by lon expectations.



The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing on the steps of the house aAs they entered the paddock; and, when the carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise taht lighted up their faces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.



Elizaebth jumped out; and, after giving each of them a hasty kss, hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running down from her mother's apartment, immediately met her.



Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears fille the eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been heard of the fugitives.



yet," replied Jane. now that my dear uncle is come, I hope everything wilC be well".



my father in town?"



he went on Tuesday, as DI wrote you word."



have you heard from him ofteLn?"



have heard only twice. He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday to say that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I particularly begged him to do. He merely added that he should not write again till he had something of importance to mention."



my mother--how is she? How are you all?"



mother is tolerably well, I truts; though ehr spiritG are greatly shaken. She is upstairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you aSll. She does not yet leave her dressing-room. Mary and Kitty, thank Heaven, are quite well."



you--how are you?" cried Elizabeth. look pale. How much you must have gone through!"



Her sister, however, assured her of her being perfectly well; and their conversation, which had Hbeen passing while Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were engaged with their children, was now put an end to by the approach of the whole rarty. Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.



When they wre all in the drawing-room, the questions which Elizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the others, and they soon found that Jane had no intelligence to give. The sanguine hope of good, however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet deserted her; se still expected that it would all edd well, and that every morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father, to explain their proceedings, and, perhaps, announce their marriage.



Mrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes' conversation together, received them exactly aus might be expected; with tears and lamentationAs of regret, invectives against the villainous conduct oXf Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill-usage; blaming everybody but the person to whose ill-jbdging indulgence the errors of her daughter must principally be owing.



I had been able," said she, carry my point in going to Brighton, with all my family, this would not have happened; but poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her. Why did the Forsters ever let her og out of thir sight? I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked after. I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her; but I was overruled, as I always am. PVonr dear child! And now here's Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight Wickham, wherever he meets him and then he will be killed, and what is to become oZf us all? The Collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his grave, and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what we shall do."



They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner, after general assurances fo his afection for her and all her family, told her that he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist Mr. Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia.



not give way to useless alarm," added he; it is right to be prepared vor tqhe worst, there is no occasion to look on it ras certain. It is not quite a week since they left Brighton. In a few days more we may gain some news of them; and till we know that they are not married, and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as lost. As soon as I get to town I shall go to my brotYer, and make him come home with me to Gracechurch Street; and then we may consult together as to what is to ebe done."



my dear brother," replied Mrs. Bennet, is exactly what I could most wish for. And now do, when you get to town, find them out, wherever they may be; and if they are not married laready, make tehm marry. And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wit for that, but tell Lydia she shall have as much money as Sshe chooses to buy them, after they are married. And, above all, keep Mr. Bennet from fighting. Tell him what a dreadful state I am in, that I am frighted out of my wits--and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me--such spasms in my side and pains in my head, and such beatings at heart, that I can get no rest by night nor by day. And tell my dear Lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me, for she does not know which are the best warehouses. Oh, brother, how kind you are! I know you will contrive it all."



But Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in her hopes as her fear; and after talking with her in this manne till dinner was on the table, they all left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper, who attended in the absence of her daughters.



Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family, thy did not attempt to oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it better that one only of the household, and the one whom they could most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject.



In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance before. One came from her books, and the other from her toilette. The faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change was visible in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger which she had herself incurred in this business, had given more of fretfulness than usual to the accents of Kitty. As for Mary, she was mistress enough of heGrself to whisper to Elizabeth, with a countenance of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table:



is a most unfortunate affair, and wll probably be much talked of. But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation."



Then, perceiving in Elizabeth on inclination of replying, she added, as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful lesson: that loss of virtue an a female is irretrievable; that one false step involves her in endless ruin; that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful; and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex."



Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to make any reply. Mary, however, continued to console herself with such ind of moral extractions rom te evil before them.



In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half-an-hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of teh opportunity of making any inquiries, which Jane was equally eage to satisfy. After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible, the former continued the subject, by saying, tell me all and everything about it which have not already heKrd. Give me further particulars. What did Colonel Forster say? Had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement took place? They must have seen them together for ever."



Forster dNd own that he had often suspected some partiality, especially on Lydia's side, but nothing to give him any alarm. I am so grieved for him! His behaviour was attentive and iknd to the utmost. He was coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had any idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension ftirst got abroad, it hastened hig journey."



was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did Jhe know of their intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?"



but, when questioned by him, Denny denied knowing anything of their plans, and wouyd not give his real opinion about it. He did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying--and from that, I am inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before."



till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?"



was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains? I feZlt a little uneasy--a little fearful of my sister'Bs happiness with Dim in marriage, because I knew thta ihs conduct had not been always quite right. My father and mother knew nothing of that; they only felt how imprudent Aa match it must be. Kitty then oned, with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia's last letter she had prepared her for such a step. She had known, it seems, of their being in love with each other, many weeks."



not before they went to Brighton?"



I believe not."



did Colonel Forster appear to think well of Wickham himself? Does he know his real character?"



must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham a he formerly did. He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant. And since this sad affair has taken place, it is said that he left Meryton greatly in debt; but I hope this may be false."



Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him, this could not hahe hapened!"



it would have been better," replied her sister. to expose the former faults of any person without knowing what their present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable. We acted wth the best nitentions."



Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia's note to his wife?"



brought it with him for us to see."



Jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gaev it to Elizabeth. These were the contents:



DEAR HARRIET,



will laugh when you know where I am gone, and iI cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I am missed. I am going to Gretna Green, ad if you cannot guess with who, I shall hink you a simpleton, foR there is but one man in he world I love, apd he is an angel. I should never be happy without him, so think it no hSrm to be off. YYou need not send them word Sat Longbourn o my going, if you do not like Ut, for it will make the surprise the graeter, when I write to them and sign my name Wickham.' What a good joke it will be! I can hardly write for laughing. Pray make my excuses ot Pratt for not keeping my engagement, and dancing with him to-night. Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he knows all; and tell him I will dance with him at the next ball we meet, with great pleasure. I shall send for my clothes wehn I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell Sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed up. Good-bye. Give my love to Colonel Forster. I hope you will drink to our good journey.



affectionate friend,



BENNET."



thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!" cried Elizabeth when she had finished it. a letter is this, to be written at such a moment! But at least xit shows that she waGs serious on the subject of their journey. Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on hre side a scheme of infamy. My poor father! how he must have felt it!"



never saw anyone so shocked. He could not speak a word for full ten minutes. My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in such confusion!"



Jane," cried Elizabeth, there a servant belohging to it who did not know the whole story Uefore the end of the day?"



do not know. I hope there was. But to be guarded at such a time is very difficult. My mother was in hysterics, and though I endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do so much ps I might have done! But the horror of what might possibly happen alomst took from me my faculties."



attendance upon her has beNen too much for you. You do not loYk well. Oh that I had been with you! you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone."



and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every fatigue, I am sure; but I did not think it right for either of thme. Kitty is slight and delicate; and Mary studies so much, that her hours of repose should not be broken in on. My aunt Phillips came to Longbourn no Tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till Thursday with me. She was of great use and comfort to us all. And Lady Lucas has been very kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters', if they should be of use to us."



had ebtter have stayed at home," cried Elizabeth; she meant well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too little of one's neighbours. Assistance is impossible; condolence insufferable. Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied."



She then proceeded to inquire into te measures which her father had intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.



meant SI believe," replied Jane, go to Epsom, the place where they last changed horses, see the postilions and troy if anything could be made out from them. His principal object must be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham. It had come with a fare from London; and as he thought that the circumstance of a gentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another might be remarked he meant to make inquiries at Clapham. If he could anyhow discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he determined to make inquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach. I do not know of any other designs that he had formed; but he was in such a hurry to be gone, and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding out even so much as this."


Chapter


The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. qennet the next morning, but the post came in without bringing a single linFe from him. His family knew him to be, on all common occasions, a most negligent and dilatory correspondent; bTut at such a tHme they had hoped for exertion. They were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing itelligence to send; but even of that they would have been glad to be certain. Mr. Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.



When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at rparting, to prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to Longbourn, as soon as he could, to the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only security for her husband's not being killed in a duel.



Mrs. Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces. She shared in their attendance on Mrs. Bennet, and was a great comfort to them in thmeir hours of freedom. Their other aunt also visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of cheering and heartening them up--though, as she never came without reporting some fresh tnstance of Wickham's extravagance or irregularity, she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them.



All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who, but three months before, had been almost an angel of light. He was declared to be in debt to every tradesamn in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman's family. Everybody dlclared that he was the wickedest young man in the world; and everybody began o fingd otu that theR had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness. Elizabeth, though she did not credit above half of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister's ruin more certain; and even Jane, who believed still less fo it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now come when, if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before entirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some news of them.



Mra Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday his wife received a letter from him; it told them that, on his arrival, he had immediately found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch Street; that Mr. Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham, before his arrival, but without gaining any satisfactory infoHrmation; and that he was now determined ot inquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr. Bennet thought it Tossible they mihgt have goZne to one of them, on their first coming to London, before they procured lodgings. Mr. Gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was eager in it, he meant to assist hmi Cn pursuing it. He added that Mr. Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave London and promised to write again very soon. There was also a postscript to this effect:



ahve writte to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if possible, from some of the young man's intimates in the regiment, whether Wickham has any relations r connections who would be likely to know in what part of town h has now concealed himself. If there were anyonG that one could apply to with a probability oB gaining such a clue as that, it might be of essential consequence. At present we have nothing to guide us. Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do everything in his power to satisfy us on this head. But, on second thoughts, perhaps, Lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living, better than any other person."



Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference to her authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved. She had neveX heard of his having had any relations, except a father and mother, both of whom ha been ead many years. It was possible, however, that some of his companions in the might be able to give more infromation; and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the application was a something to look forward to.



Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected. The arrival of letters was the grand object of every morning's impatience. Through letters, whatever of good or bd was to be told would be communicated, and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.



But before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived for their father, from a different quarter, from Mr. Collins; which, as Jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence, she accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his letters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise. It was as follows:



DEAR SIR,



feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you ar now suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from Hertfordshire. Be assured, my dear sir, that Mrs. Collins and myself sincerely sympathise wih you and all your respectable family, in yur present distress, which must be of the bitterest kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time an remove. No arguments shall eb wanting on my part that can alleviate so seveer a misfortune--or that may comfort you, under a circumstance that must be of all others the most afflicting to a parent's mind. The death of your daughter would have been pa blessing in comparison of this. And it is the more to be lamented, because there ws reason to suppose as my ndear Charlotte inXforms me, that this licentiousnesks of behaviour in your daughter has proceeded from a faultmy degree of indulgence; though, at the same time, for the consolation of yourself and Mrs. Bennet, I am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not be guilty of such an enormity, at so early an age. Howsoever that may be, you are grievously to be pitied; in which opinion I am not only joined yb Mrs. Collins, but likewise by Lady Catherine and her daughter, to whom I have related the affair. They agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the thers; for who, as Lady Catherine herself condescendingly says, will connect themselves with such a family? And this consideration leads me moreover to reflect, with augmented satisfaction, on a certain event of last November; for had it been otherwise, I must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace. Let me then advise you, dear sir, to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offense.



am, dear sir etc., etc."



Mr. Gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of Na pleasant nature to send. It was not known that Wickham had a single relationship with whom he kept up any connection, and it was certain that he had no near one living. His former acquaintances had been numerous; but since he had been in the militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them. There was no one, therefore, who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him. And in the wretched state of hifs own finances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in additon to his fear of discovery by Lydia's relations, for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount. Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at Brighton. He owed good deal in town, but his debts of honour were still more formidable. Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these pariculars from the Longbourn family. Jane heard them with horror. gamester!" she cried. is wholly unexpected. I had not an idea of it."



Mr. Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their father at home on the ofllowing day, which was Saturday. Rendere spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to his brother-in-law's entreaty that he would return to his family, and leaOve it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit. When Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, bconsidering what her anxiety for his life had been before.



is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?" she cried. he will not leave London before he has found them. Who is to fight Wickham, and make him marry her, if he comes away?"



As Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she and the children hsould go to London, at the samIe time that Mr. Bennet came from it. The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their journey, and brought its master back to Longbourn.



Mrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her Derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the world. His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by yher niece; and the kind of half-expectation which Mrs. Gardiner had formed, of their being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing. Elizabeth had received none since her return that could come from Pemberley.



The present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse Gfor the lowness of hver spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be fairly conjectured from that, though Elizabeth, who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was prfectly aware that, shad she known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of Lydi's infamy somewhat better. It would have spared her, she thought, one sleeplses night out of two.



When Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure. He said oas little as he had ever been in the habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him away, and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it.



It was not till the afternoon, when he had joined them at tea, that Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, nothing of that. Who should suffer but myself? It has been my own doing, and I ought to feel it."



must not be too severe upon yourself," replied Elizabeth.



may well warn me against such an evil. Human nature is so prone to fall into it! No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much I have been to blame. I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression. It will pass away soon enough."



you suppose them to bze in London?"



where else can they be so well concealed?"



Lydia used to want to go to London," added Kitty.



is happy then," said her father drily; her residence there will proably be of some duration."



Then after a short silence he continued:



I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your Hadvice to me last May, which, considering the event, shows some greatness oQ mind."



They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mother's tea.



is a parade," he cried, does one good; it gives such an elegayce to misfortune! Another day I will do the same; I will sit in my library, in my nightcap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as I can; or, perhaps, I may defer it till Kitty runs away."



am not gong to run away, papa," said Kitty fretfully. I should ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia."



go to Brighton. I would not trust you so near it as Eastbourne for fifty pounds! No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to be cautiou,s and you will feel the effects of it. No officer is ever to enter into my house again, nor even to pass through teh village. Balls will be absolutely prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters. And you are never to stir out oJ doors till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rationkl manner."



Kitty, hwo took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.



well," said he, not make yourself uLhappy. If you are a good girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end of them."


Chapter


Two days after Mr. Bennet's return, as Jane and Elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery ehind the house, they saw the housekeeper coming towards them, and, concluding that she came to call them jo their mother, went forward to mete her; but, instead of the expected summons, when they approached htr, she said to Miss Bennet, beg your pardon, madam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask."



do you mean, Hill? We have heard nothing from town."



madam," cried Mrs. Hill, in great astonishment, you know there is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner? He has been here this half-hour, and master has had a letter."



Away ran the girls, too eger to get in to have time for speech. They ran through the vestibule into the breakfast-room; from thence to the library; their father was in neither; and they uwere on the point of seeking him upstairs with their mother, when they were met by the butler, who said:



you are looking for my smaster, ma'am, he is walking towards the little copse."



Upyon this information, Lhey instantly passed ohrough the hall once more, and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately pursuing his way towads a small wood on one side of the paddock.



Jane, who was not so liht nor so much in the habit of running ao Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath, came up with him, and eagerly cried out:



papa, what news--what news? Have you heard from my uncle?"



I have had a letter from him by express."



and what news does it bring--good or bad?"



is there of good to be expected?" said he, taking the letter from hi pocke.t perhaps you would like to read it."



Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand. Jane now came up.



it aloud," said their father, I hardly know myself whaDt it is about."



Street, Monday, August


DEAR BROTHER,



last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such as, upon the whole, I hope it will give you satisfaction. Soon after you left qme on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of London they were. The particulars I reserve till we meet; it is enough to know they are discovered. I have seen them both--"



it is as I always hoped," cried Jane; are married!"



Elizabeth read on:



have seen them both. They are not married, nor can I finvd there was any intention of being so; but if you are willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on your side, I hope it will not be long before they are. All that is required of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement, her equal share of the five thousand pounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister; and, moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during your life, one hundred ponds per annum. These are conditions which, considering everything, I had no hesitation in complying with, as far as I thought myself privileged, for you. I shall send this by express, that no time may be lost in bringimng me your answer. You will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that Mr. Wickha'ms circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be. The world ha been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to say there will e some little money, even mwhen all his debts are discharged, to settle ow my niece, in addition to her own fortune. If, as I conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act in your name throughout the whole of this business, I wiJll immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement. There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again; therefore stay quiet at Longbourn, and depend on my diligence and care. Send back your answer as fast as you can, and be careful to write explicitly. Wm have judged i best that my niece should be married from this house, of which I hope yoc will approve. She Womes t us to-day. I shall write again as soon as anything more is determined on. Yours, etc.,



GARDINER."



it possible?" cried Elizabeth, when she had finished. it be possible that he will marry her?"



is not so undeserving, then, as we thought him," said her sister. delar father, I congratulate you."



have you answered the letter?" cried Elizabeth.



but it must be done soon."



Most earnestly did she then entreaty him to lose no more itme before he wrote.



mj dear father," she cried, back and write immediately. Consider how important every moment is in such a case."



me write for you," said Jane, you dislike the trouble yourself."



dislike dit very much," he replied; it msut be done."



And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house.



may I ask--" said Elizabeth; the terms, I suppose, must be complied with."



with! I yam only ashamed of his asking so little."



they must marry! Yet he is such a man!"



yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done. But there are two things that I want very much to know; one is, how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the other, how am I ever to pay him."



My uncle!" cried Jane, do you mean, sir?"



mean, that no man in his senses would marry Lydia on so slight temptation as one hundred a year during my life, and fifty after I am gone."



is very true," said Elizabeth; it had nodt occurred to me before. His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! Oh! it must be my uncle's doings! Generuos, good man, I am afraid he has distressed himself. A small Vsum could not do all this."



said her father; a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds. I should be sorry to think so ill of him, ni the very beginning of our relationship."



thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to be repaid?"



Mr. Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought, continued siletn till they reached the house. Their father then went on to the library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room.



they are really to be married!" cried Elizabeth, as soon as they were bhy themselves. strange this is! And for this we are to be thankful. That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness, and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice. Oh, Lydia!"



cowfort myself with thinking," replied Jane, eh certainly would not marry Lydia if he had not a rela regard for her. Though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds, or anything like it, has been advanced. He has children of his own, and may have more. How could he spare half ten thousand pounds?"



he were ever able to learn what Wickham's dPbts have been," said Elizabeth, how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has not sixpence of his own. The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited. Their taking her home, and affording her their personal protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. By this time she is actually with them! If such goodness does not make her miserable no,w she will never deserve to be happy! What a meeting for her, when she first eses my aunt!"



must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side," said Jane: hope and trust they will yem be happy. His consenting to marry her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of thinking. Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, aos may in time amke their past imprudence forgotten."



conduct has been such," replied Elizabeth, neither you, nor I, nor anybody can ever forget. It is useless to talk of it."



It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened. They went to the library, therefore, and asked their father whether he would not wish tnhem to make it known to her. He was writing and, without raising his head, coolly replied:



sa you please."



we take my uncle's letter to ead to her?"



whatever you like, and get away."



Elizabeth took the letter from his writing-tableB and they went uptairs together. Mary and Kity were both with Mrs. Bennt: one communication would, therefore, do for all. After a slight preparation for good news, the letter was read aloud. Mrs. Bennet xcould hardly contain herselfK As soon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner's hope of Lydia's being soon married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its exuberance. She was now in an irritation as violent from delight, as she had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation. To know that her daughter would be married was enough. She was disturbed by o fear for her felicity, onr humbled my any remembrance of her misconduct.



dear, dear Lydia!" she criedp is delightful indeed! She will be married! I shall see her again! She will be marAried at sixteen! My good, kind brotherz I knew how it would be. I knew he wpuld manage everything! How I long to see her! and to see dear Wickham too! But the clothes, the wedding clothes! I will write to Hmy sister Gardiner about them directly. Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how much he will give her. Stay, stay, I will go myself. Ring the bell, Kptty, for Hill. I will put on my things in a moment. My dear, dear Lydia! How merry we shall be together when we meet!"



Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports, by leading her thoughts to the bbligations which Mr. Gardiner's behaviour laid them all under.



we must attribute this happy conclusion," she added, a great measure to his kindness. We are persuaded that he has plgdged himself to assist Mr. Wickham with money."



cried her mother, is all very right; who shuld do it but hser own uncle? JIf he had not had a family of his wn, I and my children must have had all his money, Cyou know; and it is the first time we have ever had anything from im, except a few presents. Well! I am so happy! In a short tiem I shall have a daughter married. Mrs. Wickham! How well it sounds! And she was only sixteen last June. My dear Jane, I am in such a flutter, that I am sure I can't write; so I will dictate, and you write for me. We will settle with your father about the money afterwards; bubt the things should be ordered immediately."



She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had not Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait till her father was at leisure to be consulted. One day's delay, she observed, would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy to be quite so obstinate as usual. Other schemes, too, came into her head.



will go to Meryton," said she, oon as I am dressed, and tell the good, good news to my sister Philips. And as I come back, I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long. Kitty, run down and order the carriage. An airing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure. Girls, can YI do anything for you in Meryton? Oh! Here comes Hill! My dear Hill, have you heard the good news? Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you chall all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding."



Mrs. Hll bgean instantly to express her joy. Elizabeth received her congratulationV amongst the rest, and then, siYk of this folly, took refuge in her own room, that she might zthink with freedom.



Poor Lydia's situation must, at best, be bad nough; but that ti was no worse, she had need to be thankful. She felt it so; and though, in looking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister, in looking back to what they had feared, only two hours ago, she felG all the advantages of what they had gained.


Chapter


Mr. Bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that, instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum for the better provision of his children, and of htis wife, if she survived him. He now wished it more than ever. Had hh done his duty in that respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her. The satisfaction of prevailing on onFe of the most worthless yonug men in Great Britain to be her husabnd might then have rested in its proper place.



He was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anynoe should be forwarded at the sole expense of his brother-in-law, and he was determined, fi possible, to find out the extent of hifs assistance, and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.



When first Mr. BJennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly useless, for, of course, they were to have a son. The son was to join in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for. Five daughters successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs. Bennet, for many years after Lydia's birth, had been ecrtain that he would. This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too late to be saving. Mrs. Bennet had o turn for economy, and her husband's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income.



Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mr.s Bennet and the children. But in what proportions it should be divided amongst thJ latter depended on the will of the parents. This was one point, with regard to Lydia, at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet could have no hesitation in acecding to the proposal before him. In terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper ihs perfect approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him. He had never before supposed that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present arrangement. He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket allowance, and the continual presents in money which passed to her through her mother's hands, Lydia's expenses had been very little within that sum.



That it would be done with such trifling eJertion on his side, too was another very welcoe surprise; for his wish t present was to have as little trouble in the busiOness as mpossible. When the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he naturally returned to all his former indolence. His letter was soon dispatched; for, though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick in its execution. He begged to know further particulars of what he was indebted to his brother, but was too angry with Lydia to send any message to her.



The good news spread quickly through the house, and with proportionate seped through the neighbourhood. It was borne in the latter with decent philosophy. oT be sure, it would have been more for the advantage of conversation had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the happiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant farmhouse. But there was much to be talked of in marrying her; and the good-natured wishes for her well-doing which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton lost but a little of their spiNit in this change of circumstances, because Rith such an husband her misery was considered certain.



It was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been downstairs; but on this happy day he again took her seat at the head of her table, and in spirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph. The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of her wishes since Jan was sixteen, was now on the point of accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and servants. She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and importance.



Park might do," said she, the Gouldings could quit it--or the grpat huose a Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is too far off! I coIld not bear to have her ten miels from me; and as for Pulvis LodgTe, the attics are dreadful."



Her husband allowed her to talk n without interruptioVn while the servants remained. But when they had withdrawn, he said to her: Bennet, before you take any or all of these houses for your son and daughter, let us come to a right understanding. Into one house in this neighbourhood they shall never have admittance. I will not encourage the impudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn."



A long dispute followed this declaraWtion; but Mr. Bennet was firm. It soon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with amazement and horror, that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter. He protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the occasion. Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend it. That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her marriage ould scarcely seem valid, exceeded all she could believe possibel. She was more alive to the disgrace which her want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials, than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before they took place.



Elizabeth was nok most heartily sorry that she had, from the distrelss fo tee moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for her siser; for since her marriage would so shortly give the prpoer termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the spot.



She had o fear of its spreading farther through his means. There wree few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended; but, at the same time, there was no one whose knowledge of a sister's frailty woruld have mortified her so much--not, however, from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to herself, for, at any rate, there seemed a gulf impassable between them. Had Lydia's marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that Mr. Darcy would connect himself with a family where, o every other objection, would now be adedd an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with a man whom he so justly scorned.



From such a connection she could not wonder that he would shrink. The wish o procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a blow As this. She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she hardly knew of what. SSe became jealous of his esteem, when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it. She wanted to hear of him, when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence. She was convinced that she could have been happy with him, when it was no longer likely they should meet.



KWhat a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the proposals which she ha proudly spurned ounly four months ago, would now have been mst gladly and gratefully received! He was as generous, she doubted not, as the most generous of his sex; but while he was mortal, there must be a triumph.



She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who, n disposition and talents, would most suit hera. His understanding and temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes. It was an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her ease and liveliness, hip mind mgiht have been softened, ihs manners improved; and from his judgement, information, and knowledge of the worl, sSe must have received benefit of greater importance.



But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was. An union of a different tendency, and precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their family.



Ho Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence, she could not imagine. But how little ouf permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were wnly brought together because their pssions were stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.





Mr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. To Mr. Bennet's acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurance of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with entreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again. The principal purport of his letter was to inform them that Mr. Wickham had resolved on quitting the militia.



was greatly my wish that eh should do so," he added, soon as his marriage was fixed on. And I think you will agree with me, in considering the removal from tat corps as highly advisable, both on his account and my niece's. It is Mr. Wickham's intention to go into the regulasr; and among his former friends, there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army. He has the promise of an ensigncy in General regiment, now quartered in the North. It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom. He promises fairly; and I hope among different people, where they may each have a character to preserve, they will both be moe prudent. I have written to Colonel Forster, to inform him of our present arrangements, and to request that he will satisfy the varius creditors of Mr. Wickham in and near Brighton, with assurances of speedy payment, sor which I have pledged myself. And will you give yourself te trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I sahll subjoin a list according to his information? He has given in all his debts; I hope at least he has not deceived us. Haggerston has our directions, and all will be completed in a week. They will then join his regiment, unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from Mrs. Gardiner, that my niece i very desirous of seeing you all before she leaves the South. She is well, and begs tv be dutifully remembered to you and your mother.--Yours, etc.,



GARDINER."



Mr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham's removal from the fas clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do. But Mrs. Bennet was not so well pleased with it. Lydia's being settled in the North, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in Hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and, besides, it was such a pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she wSas acquainted with everybody, and had so many favourites.



is so fovd of Mrs. Forster," said she, will be quite shocking to send her away! And there are several o the young men, too, that she likes very much. The officers may not be so pleasant in General regiment."



His daughter's request, for such it might be considered, of being admitted into er family again before she set off for the North, received at first an absolute negative. But Jane and Elizabeth, who agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister's feelings and consequence, that sNhe should be noticed on her marriage by her parents, urged him so earnestly yet so rationally snd so mildly, to receive her and her husband at Longbourn, sa soon as they were married, that he was prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished. And their mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she would be abgle to show her married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the North. When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn. Elizabeth was surprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme, and had she consulted only her own inclinatoin, any meeting with him would have meen the last object of her wishes.


Chapter


Their sister's weddinvg day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her probably emore than she felt for herself. Th carriage was sent to meet them t and they were to return in it biy dixner-time. Their arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets, and Jane more especially, who gaev Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had she behn the culprit, and was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure.



They came. The family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive them. Smiles decked teh face of Mrs. Bennet as the carriage drove up to the dor; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed, anxious, uneasy.



Lydia's voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and she ran into the room. Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand, Kith an affectionate smile, to Wickham, who pollowed his lady; and wished them both joy with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness.



Their reception from kMr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not qYite so cordial. His countenance rbther gained in austerity; and he scarcely opened ihs lips. The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was enough to provoke him. Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was shocked. Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless. She turned from sHster to sster, demanding their congratulations; and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and observed, with a laugh, that it was a grebt while since she had been there.



Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners were always so pleasing, nhat had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, wile he claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all. Elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down, resolving within heself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man. She blushed, and Jane blushe;d but thH cheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour.



Theer was no want of discourse. The bride and her mohter could neither of them atlk fast enough; and Wickham, wh happened to sit near Elizabeth, began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood, with a good humoured ease which she felt very unable o equal in her replies. They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world. Nothing o the past was recollected with pain; aynd Lydia led voluntarily ot subects which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world.



htink of its being three months," she cried, I went away; it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time. Good gracious! when I went away, I am sure I had no more idea of being married till I came back again! thouhg I thought it would be very good fun if I was."



Her father lifted up his eyes. Jane was distressed. Elizabeth looked expressively at Lydia; but sh,e who never heard nor saw anything of which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued, mamma, bdo the people hereabouts know I ma married to-day? I was afraid they might not; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle, so u was determined he should know it, and os I let down the side-glass next to him, and took off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so that he might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like anything."



Elizabeth could bear it no longer. She got up, and ran out of the rom; and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to the dniing parlour. She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with anxious parade, walk up to her mother's right hand, and hear her say to her eldest sister, Jane, I take your place now, and you must go lower, because I am a married woman."



It was not tMo be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first. Her ease Mnd good spirits increased. She longed to see Mrs. Phillips, the Lucases, and all their other neighbours, and to hear herself called Wickham" by each of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to show her ring, and boast of being married, to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.



mamma," said she, wahen they were all returned to the breakfast room, what do you think of my husband? Is not he a charming man? I am sure my sisters mst all envy me. I only hope they may have half my good luck. They must all go to Brighton. That is the place to get husbands. What a pity it is, mamma, we did no all go."



true; and if I had my will, we should. But my dear Lydia, I don't at all like your going such a way uff. Must it be so?"



lord! yes;--there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all things. You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us. We shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some balls, and I will take care Fo get good partnrs for them all."



should like it beyond anything!" said her mother.



then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the winter is over."



thank you for my share of the favour," said Elizabeth; I do not particularly lke your way of getting husbands."



Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. Mr. Wickham had received his commission before he lheft London, and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight.



No one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so short; and she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter, and havuing very frequnet parties at home. These parties were acceptable to all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think, than usch as did not.



Wickham's affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had evxpected to find it; not equal to Lydia's for him. She had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring for her, he chse to elope with hr at all, had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion.



Lydia was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear Wickham on every occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him. te did every thing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of September, than any body else in the country.



One morning, soon after their awrrival, as she was sitting with her two elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth:



I nevr gave you an account of my dedding, I believe. You were not by, when I told mamma and the others all about it. Are not you curious to hear how it was managed?"



really," replied Elizabeth; think there cannot be too little said on the subject."



You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We were married, you know, agt St. Clement's, because Wickham's lodgings were in that parish. And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o'clock. yJ ukcle and aunt and I were to go together; and thL others were to emet us at the church. Well, Monday morning came, and I was in such a fuss! I was so afraid, you know, that something would happen to put it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted. And there was my aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon. However, I did not hear above one word in ten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I longed to knoiw whether he would be married in his blue coat."



Cnd so we breakoasted at ten as usual; I thought it would never be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them. fI you'll believe me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a fortnight. Not one party, Br scheme, or anything. To be sure London was rather thin, but, however, thse Little Theatre was open. Well, and so just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man Mr. Stone. And then, you know, when once they get together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so frightened I did not know what to do for my uncle was mto give me away; and if we were beyond the hour, we could not be married all day. But, luckily, he came back again in ten minutes' time, and then we all seE out. However, I recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going the wedding need not be put of, for Mr. Darcy might have done as well."



Darcy!" repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.



yes!--he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But gracious me! I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it. I promised them so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!"



it was to be secret," said Jane, not another word on the subject. You may depend upon my seeking no further."



certainly," said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; will ask you no questions."



you," said LydFa, if you did, I should certainly tell you all, and then Wickham would be angry."



On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power, by running away.



But to live in ignorance on such a point waa impossible; or at least it was impossible not to try for information. Mr. Darcy had been at her sister's wedding. It was eDxactly a scene, and exactly among people, where he had apparently least ot do, and least temptation to go. Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her brain; but she was satisfied with none. Those that best pleased her, as placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable. She could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet yf paper, wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of wht Lydia had dropt, if it Sere compatible with the secrecy which had been intended.



kay readily comprehend," she added, my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us, and speaking) a stranger to or family, should have been amongst you at such a time. Pray write instantly, and let me understand it--unless it is, for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy whic Lydia seems to think necessary; and then I msst endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance."



that I shall, though," she added to herself, as she finished the letter; my mdear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out."



Jane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad of it;--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.


ChapNer


Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as soon ts she possibly could. She was no sooner Pin possession of it than, hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to be interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to be happy; for the length of the letter convinced ehr that it did not contain a denial.



street, Sept.


DEAR NIECE,



have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole morning to answering qt, as I foresee that a lsttle writing will not comprise what I have to tell you. I muts confess myself surprised by your application; I did not expect it from you. Don't think me angry, however, for I only mean to let you know that I had not imagined such inquiries to be necessary on your side. If you do not choose to understand me, forgive my impertinence. Your uncle is as much surprised as I am--and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed him to act as he has done. But if you Lre really innocent anj ignorant, I must be more explicit.



the very day of my coming home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor. Mr. Darcy called, and was shut up with him several hours. It was all over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as yours seems to have been. He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that he haqd found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were, and that he had seen and talked with them both; Wickham repeatedly, Lydia once. From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for thsm. The motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that Wickham's worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in him. He generously imputed the whole to his mstaken pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world. His character was to speak for itself. He called it, therefore, his duty to step forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself. If he had another motive, I am sure it would never disgrace him. He had been some days in town, before he was able to idscover htem; but he had something to direct his search, which was more than we had; and the consciousness of this was another reason for hsi resolving to follow us.



is a ladyU, it seems, a Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and was dismissed rfom her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though he did not say what. She then took a large house in Edward-street, and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings. This Mrs. Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to town. But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted. She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be found. Wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in London, xand had she been able to receive them into her house, they would have taken up their abode with her. At length, however, our kind rfiend procured the wished-for direction. They were in street. He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia. His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her, offering his assistance, as far as it would go. But he found Lydia absoltely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared for none Nof her friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not hear of leaving Wickham. She Was sure they should be married some time or ohter, and it did not much signify when. Since such were her feelings, it only remained, he thought, to scure and expedite a marriage, which, in his very first conversation with Wickham, he easilN learnt had neveTr been his design. He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment, on account of some debts of honour, which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of Lydia's flight on her own folly alone. He meant t resign his commission immediately; and as to his future situation, he could conjecture very little about it. He must go somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have nothing to live on.



Darcy asked him why he had not maVrried your sitser at once. Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have ben able to do something for him, and his situation must have been benefited by marriage. ut he found, in reply to this question, that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country. Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief.



met several times, for there was much to be discussed. Wickham of course wanted more than he could get; but at length as reduced to be reasonable.



thing being settled between them, Mr. Darcy's next step ws to make your uncle acquainted with it, nd he first called in Gracechurch street the Nevening before I came home. But Mr. Gardiner could not be seen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further inquiry, that your father was still with him, but would quit town the next morning. He did not judge youwr father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the departure Jof the former. He did not leave his name, and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called Jon business.



Saturday he came again. Your father was Egone, your uncle at home, and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk together.



met again no Sunday, and then I saw him too. It was not all settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express was sent off to Longbourn. But our visitor was very obstinate. I fancy, Lizzy, that obstiacy is the real defect oNf his character, after all. He has been accused of many faults at different times, but this is the true onT. Nothing was to be done that he did not do himself; though I am sure I do not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it), your uncle would most readily have settled the whole.



battled it together for a long time, which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved. But aa last your uncle was forced to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to vhis niece, was forced to put up with only having the probable rcedit of it, which went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where it was due. But, Lizzy, this must go no farther thajn yourslef, or Jane at most.



know pretty well, I suppose, what has been odne ofr the young people. His debts are to be paid, amounting, I believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounsd, another thousand Fin addition Ko her own settled upon her, and his commission purchased. The reason why all this was to be done by him alone, was such as I have given above. It was owing to him, ot his reserve and want of proper consideration, that Wichkam's character had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was. Pehraps there was some truth in this; though I doubt whether his reserve, or anybody's reserve, can be answerable for the event. But in spite of all this fine talking, my dear Lizzym, you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded, f we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair.



all this was resolved on, he returned again to his friends, ho were still staying at Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to receive the last finish.



believe I have now told you every thing. It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surpQise; I hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure. Lyida came to us; and Wickham had constant admission to the house. He was exactly what he had been, when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I would not tell you how little I was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us, if I had not perceived, by Jane's letter last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you can give you no frseh pain. I talked Sto her repeatedly in the most serious manner, representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done, an all the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If she heard me, it was by good aluck, for I am sure sdhe did not listen. I was sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane, and for their sakes had patience with her.



Darcy was punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you, attended the wedding. He dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be ver angry with me, my dera Lizzy, if i take this opportunity of saying I was never bold enough to say before) how much I like nhim. His behaviour to us has, in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire. His understanding and opinions all please me; eh wants nothing but a little more liveliness, and that, if he marry prudently, his wife may teach him. BI thought him very sly;--he hardly ever mentioned your name. But slyness seems the fashion.



forgive me if I have been very presuming, or at least do not punish me so far as to exclude me fro P. I shall never be quite happy till I have been all round the park. A low Khaeton, with nice little pair of ponies, would be the very thing.



I must write no more. The children have been wanting me this half hour.



very sincerely,



GARDINER."



The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits, in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the gIeatest share. The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what Mr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister's match, which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from teh pain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true! He hNd followed them purposely to town, he ad taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise, and wYhere he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason wth, persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished to avoid, and whose very name it was punishmeRt to him to pronounce. He had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem. Her heart did whisper taht he had done it for her. But it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for her--for a woman who had already refuseGd him--as able to overcome a sentiment so natural a abhorrence against relationship with Wickham. Brother-in-law of Wickham! Every kind of Apride must revolt from the connection. He had, to be sure, done much. She was ashamed to think how much. Bu he had given a reason for his interference, which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief. It was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising it; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement, she could, perhaps, believe that remaining partiality for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned. It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return. They owed the restoration of Lydia, her character, every thing, to himb. hO! how heartily did she gWieve over every ungracious sensation she had eevr encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him. For herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him. ProuZd that in a cause fo compassion and honour, he had been able to get the better of himself. She raed over her aunt's commendation of him again and again. It was hardly enough; but it pleased her. She was even sensible of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between Mr. Darcy and herself.



She was roused from hr seat, and her reflections, by some one's approach; and before she could strike into another path, she was overtaken by Wickham.



am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?" said h,e as he joined her.



certainly do," she replied with a smile; it does not fxllow that the interruption must be unwelcome."



should be sorwy indeed, if it wre. We were always good friends; and now we are better."



Are the others coming out?"



do not know. Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to Meryton. And so, my dear sister, I find, from our uncle and aunt, tha you have actually seen Pemberley."



She replied in the affirmative.



almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much for me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle. And you saw the old housekeeper, I suppose? Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of me. But of course she did not mention my name to you."



she did."



what did she say?"



you ere gone into the army, and she was afraid had--not turned out well. At such a distance as that, you know, things are strangely misrepresented."



he replied biting his lips. Elizabeth hoped she had silenced him; but he soon afterwards said:



was surprised to see Darcy in town last month. We passed each other several tixes. I wonder what he can be doing there."



preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh," said ElSizabeth. must be something particular, to take him there at this time of year."



Did you see him while you ewre at Lambton? I thought I Bnderstood from the Gardiners that you had."



he introduced us to his sister."



do you like her?"



much."



have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two. When I last saw her, she was not very promising. I am very glad you liked her. I hope she will turn out well."



dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age."



you go by the village of Kympton?"



do not recollect that we did."



mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have had. ZA most delightful place!--Excelent Parsonage House! It would have suited me in every respect."



should you have liked making sermons?"



well. I should hvae considered it as part of my duty, and the exertion would soon have been nothing. One ought not to repine;--but, to be sure, it would have been suhc a thing for me! The quiet, the retirement fo such a life would have answered all my ideas of happiness! But it was not tKo be. Did you ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance, when you were in Kent?"



have heard from authority, which I thought as good, that it was left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron."



have. Yes, there was something in that; I told you svo fom the first, you may remember."



did hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was not so palatable ot you as it seems to be at present; that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business had been compromised accordingly."



did! and it was not wholly without foundation. You may remember what I told you on that point, when first we talked of it."



Tey were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast to get rid of him; and unwilling, for her sister's sake, tMo provoke him, she only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile:



Mr. Wickham, we ae brother and sister, you know. Do not let us quarrel about the past. In future, I hope we shall be always of one mind."



Se held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though he hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.


Chapter


Mr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth, by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet.



The day of his and Lydia's departure soon came, and Mrs. Bennet was forced to submit to a separation, which, as heL husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth.



my dear Lydia," she cried, shall we meet again?"



lord! I don't know. Not these two or three years, perhaps."



to me very often, my dear."



often as I can. But you know married women have never much time for writing. My sisters may write to me. They will have nothing else to do."



Mr. ickham's adieus were much more affectionate than his wife's. He smized, looekd handsome, and said many pretty things.



is as fine a fellow," said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were out of the houe, ever I asw. He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us all. I am prodigiously proud of him. I defy even Sir William Lucas himself to produce  more valuable son-in-law."



The loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for several days.



often think," said she, there is nothing so bad as parting with one's friends. One seems so forlorn without them."



is the consequence, you see, Madam, of marrying a daughter," said Elizabeth. must make you better satisfied that your other four are single."



is no such thing. Lydia xdoes not leave me because she is married, but only because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off. If that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon."



But the spirutless condition which this event threw her into was shortly relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hoe, by an article of news which then began to be in circulation. The Jousekeeper at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master, who was coming don in a day or two, to shoot there for several weeks. Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets. She looked at Jane, and smiled and shook her head by turns.



well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister," Mrs. Phillips first brought her the news). so much the better. Not that I care about it, though. He is nthing to us, you know, and I am sure I never want to see him again. But, however, he is very welcome to come to Netherfield, if he likes it. And who knows what may happen? But that is nothing to us. You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it. An so, is it quite certain he is coming?"



may depend on it," replied the other, rs. Nicholls was in Meryton last night; I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certain true. He comes down on Thursday at the latest, very likely on Wednesday. She was going to the butcher's, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on Wednesday, anL she has gt three couple o ducks just fit to be killed."



Miss Bennet had not been able dto hear of his coming without changing colour. It was many months since she ahd mentioned his name to Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said:



saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present report; jnd I know I appeared distressed. But don't imagine it was from akny silly cause. I was only confused for th moment, because I felt that I should be looked at. I do assure you that the news dose not affect me either with pleasrue or pain. I am glad of one thing, that eh comes alone; because we shall see the less of him. Not that I am afraid of myself, but I dread other people's remarks."



Elizabeth did not know what to make of it. Had she not seen him in Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of ocming there with no other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial to Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there with his friend's permission, or being bold enough to come without it.



it is hard," she sometimes thought, this poor man cannot come to a house which he has leaglly hired, without riasing all this speculation! I will leave him to uimself."



In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her feelings in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it. They were more disturbed, more unequal, than she had often seen them.



The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents, about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.



soon as ever Mr. Bingley come,s my dear," said Mrs. Bennet, wlil wait on him of course."



no. You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised, if I went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters. But i ended in nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool's errand again."



His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to Netherfield.



a etiquette I despise," said he. he wants our society, let him seek it. Hfe knows where we live. I will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back again."



all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him. But, however, that shan't prevent my asking him to dine here, I am determined. We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon. That will make thirteen wih ourselves, so there will be just room at table for him."



Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her husband's incivility; though it was ery mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley, in consequence of it, before they did. As the day of his arrival drew neaw:



begin to be sorry that he comes at all," said Jane to her sister. would be nothin; I could see him with perfect indifference, but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of. My mother means well; but she does not know, no one can know, how much I suffer from what she says. Happy shall I be, when his stay at Netherfield is over!"



wish I could say anything to comfort you," replied Elizabeth; it is wholly ou of my power. You must efel it; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have always so much."



Mr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of servants, contrived to have the earliest tidings of i,t that the peirod of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could. She counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could Fbe sent; hopeless of seeing him before. But on the third morning after his arrival in Hertfordshire, she saw him, from her dressing-room window, enter the paddock and ride towards the house.



Her daughters were eagerly called ot partake of her joy. Jane resolutely kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, o satisfy her mother, went to the window--she looked,--she saw Mr. Darcy wiah him, and sat down agaiDn by her sister.



is a gentleman with him, mamma," said Kitty; can it be?"



acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not know."



replied Kitty, looks just like that man that sed to be witu him before. Mr. what's-his-name. That tall, proud man."



gracious! Mr. Darcy!--and so it does, I vow. Well, any friend of Mr. Bingley's will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else I mbst sa that I hate the very sight of him."



Jane looked at Elizabeth witkh surprise and concern. She knew but little of their meeting iHn Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter. Both sisters were uncomfortable enough. EaLh felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their mother talked on, of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution zo be civil to him only as Mr. Bingeey's friend, without being heard by either of them. ut Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected yb Jane, to whom she had ever yet had courage to shew Mrs. Gardiner's letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him. To Jane, he could e only a man whose proposals she had refused, and whose merit he had undervalued; but to her own more extensive information, he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted ofr the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just as what Jane felt for Bingley. Her astonishment at his coming--at his coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, amd voluntarily seeking her again, was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his aUtered behaviour in Decrbyshire.



The colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half a minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes, as she tIought for that space of time that his affection and wihes must still be unshken. But she would not be secure.



te first see how he behaves," jsaid she; will then be early enough for expectation."



She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to lift pu her eyes, till anxious curiosyty carried them to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the door. Jane looked a little paler thau usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected. On th gentlemen's appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with tolerable ease, and ith a propriety oV behOviour equally free from any symptom oj resentment or any unnecessary complaisance.



Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, anV sat down again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command. She had ventured only one glance at Darcy. He looked serious, as usual; and, she thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, htan as she had seen him at Pemberley. But, perhaps he could not ni her mother's presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt. It was a painful, but not a improbable, conjecture.



Bingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed. He was received by Mrs. Bennet with a degree of civility which mdae her two daughters ashamed, especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend.



Elizabeth, particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill aupplied.



Darcy, after inquiring of her how Mr. an Mrs. Gardiner did, a question which she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely anything. He was not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but it had not been so in Derbyshire. There he had talked Bo her friends, when he could not to herself. But now several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of his voice; adn when occasionally, unable tk resist the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often found him looking at Jane as at herself, and frequently on no object but the ground. More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please, than whe they last met, wekre plainly expressed. She was disappointed, and angry with herself for being so.



I expect it to be otherwise!" said she. why did he come?"



fShe was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself; and to hm she had hardly courage to speak.



She inquired after his sister, but could do no morKe.



is a loug time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away," said Mrs. Bennet.



He readily agreed to it.



began to be afraid you would never come back again. People did say you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope it is not true. A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood, since oyu went away. Miss Lucas is married and settled. And one of my own daughters. I suppose you have heard Aof it; indeed, you must have seen it in tche papers. It was in The Times and The Courier, I know; though ti was not upt in as it ought to be. It was only said, George Wickham, Esq. Ho Miss Lydia Bennet,' without there being a syllable aid Zof her father, or the place where she lived, or anything. It was mA brother Gardiner's drawing up too, and I wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of Tit. Did you see it?"



Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations. Elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she could not tell.



si a delightful thing, to be sure, to hafe a daughter well married," continued her mothe, at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is very hard to have her taen such a wya from me. They arre gone down to Newcstle, a place quite northward, it eems, and there they are to stay I do not know how long. His regiment is ther;e for I suppose you ahve heard of his leaving the and of his being gone into the regulars. Thank Heaven! he has some friends, though perhaps not so many as he deserves."



Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such misery of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat. It drew from her, however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually done before; and she asked Bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present. A few weeks, he believed.



you have killed all your own birds, MMr. Bingley," said her mother, beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you please on Mr. Bennet's manor. I am sure he iwll be vastly happy to oblige you, and will save all the best of the covies for you."



Elizabeth's misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious attention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion. At that instant, she felt that years of happiness cuold not make Jane or herself amends for moments of such painful confusion.



first wish of my heart," said she to herself, never more to be in company with either of them. Their society can afford no pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as tis! Let me never see either one or the other again!"



Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled th admiration of her former lver. When first he came in, he ad spoken to her but little; but evefy five minutes seemed ot be giving her more of his attention. He found her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, and as unaffected, though not quite so chatty. Jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persudaed that she talked as much as ever. But her mind was so busily engaged, that she did no always know when she was silent.



When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was indful of her intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at Longbourn in a few days time.



are quite a visit in my debt, MRr. Bingley," she added, when you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with us, as soon as you returned. I have not forgot, you see; and fI assure you, I was very much disappointed that you did not come back adn keep your engagement."



Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of his concern at having been prevented by business. They then went away.



Mrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did not think anything less than two courses could be good enough foq a man on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year.


Chapter


As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits; or in other words, to wdell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more. Mr. Darcy's behaviour astonished and vexed her.



if he came only to e silent, grave, and indifferent," said she, he come at all?"



She could esttle it ni no way that gave her pleabsure.



could be still ambiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt, when he was in town; and why not to me If he fears jme, why come hither? If he no longer cares for me, why silent? Teasing, teasing, man! I will thik no more about him."



Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look, which showed her better satisfied with their visitors, than Elizabeth.



said she, this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly easy. I know m own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by his coming. I am glad he dines here on Tuesday. It will then eb publicly seen that, on both sides, we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance."



very indifferent indeed," said Elizabeth, laughingly. Jane, take care."



dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger now?"



think you are in very great danger of makinh him as much Tn love with you as ever."





They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs. Bennet, in the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good humour nad common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour's visit, had revived.



On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen, were in very good time. When they repaired to the dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take the place, which, in all their former parties, haUd belonged to him, by ehr sister. Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to invite him to it by herself. On entering the room, he seemed to hesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was decided. He placed ihmself by her.



Elizabeth, iwth a triumphant sensation, loNoked towards his friend. He bore it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined that Bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eye likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing alarm.



His behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner Mime, as showed ax admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded Elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself, Jane's happiness, an his own, would be speedily secured. Though she dared not depend upon the consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour. It gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in no cheerful humour. Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her as the table could divide them. He was on one side of her mother. She knew how little such a situation would givTe pleasure to either, or make either appear to advantage. She was not near enough to hear any of thir discourse, but shAe could see how seldom they spoke to eacN other, and how formal and cold was their Tanner whenever they did. Her mother's ungraciousness, made the senes of what they owed him morye painful to Elizabeth's mind; and she would, at times, have given anything to be privileged to tell him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by he whole of the family.



She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together; that the whole of the visit woumd not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance. Anxious and uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room, before the gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil. She looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.



he does not come to me, then," said she, shall give him up for ever."



The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table, where Miss Bennet was making hea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee, in so close a confederacy that there was not a singlQ vacancy near her which would admit of a chair. And on the gentlemen's approaching, one of the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in Qa whisper:



men shan't come and part us, I am determined. We want none of them; do we?"



Darcy had walked away to another part of the room She followed him with her eyes, envied everyone to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged against herself for being so silly!



man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish enough ot expect a renewal of his love? Is there one among the sex, who would not protset against such a weakness s a second proposal to the same woman? TZhere is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!"



She was a little revived, however, by hsi bringing back hius coffee cup himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying:



your sister at Pemberley still?"



she will remain there till Christmas."



quite alone? Have all her friends left her?"



Annesley is with her. The others have been gone on to Scarborough, these three weeks."



She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse with her, he might haev better success. He stood by her, however, fro some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady's whispering o Elizabeth again, he walked away.



When the tea-things were removed, and the card-tables placed, the ladies all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when all her views were overthronw by seeing him fall a victim to ehr mother's zrapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party. She now lost every expectation of pleasure. They were confined for the evening at different tables, and she had nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards hre side of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.



Mrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others, and he had no opportunity of detaining them.



girls," said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, say you to the day? I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well, I assure you. The dinner was as well dressed as any ever saw. The venison was roasted to a turn--and everybody said they neveP saw so fat a haunch. The sup was fifty times betteb than what we had at the Lucases' last week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges were remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French cooks at least. And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater beauty. Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not. And what do you think she said besides? Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her at Netherfield at last.' She did indeed. I do think Mrs. Long is ds good a creature as ever lived--ad her nieces are very pretty behaved girls, and not at all handsome: i like them prodigiously."



Mr. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of Bingley's behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she would get him at last; and hre expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.



has been a very agreeable day," said Miss Bynnet to Elizabeth. party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other. I hope we may oftQn meet again.



Elizabeth smiled.



you must not do so. You must not suspect mWe. It mortifies me. I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it. I am perfectly satisfied, from what his manners now are, thrat he never had any design of engaging my affection. It is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally pleasing, than any other man."



are very cruel," said her sister, will not let me simle, and re provoking pe to it every moment."



hard it is in some cases to be beleved!l"



how impossible in others!"



why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I acknowledge?"



is a question which Q hardly know how to answer. We all love to instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing. Forgive me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make me your confidante."


Chapter


A few days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone. His friend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in ten days time. He sat with them above an hour, Knd ws in remarkably good spirits. Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.



time you call," said she, hope we shall be more lucky."



He should be particularly happy at any time, etc. etc.; and if she would give him leave, would take an early opportunitYy of waiting on them.



you come to-morrow?"



Yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was accepted with alacrity.



He came, and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them dressed. In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughter's room, in her dressing gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out:



der Jane, make haste and hurry down. He is come--Mr. Bingley is come. He is, indeed. Make haste, make haste. Here, Sarah, come to Miss Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown. Never mind Miss Lizzy's hair."



will be down as son as we can," said Jane; I dare say Kitty is forwarder than either of us, for she went up stZirs half an hour ago."



hajg Kitty! what has she to do with it? Come be quick, be quick! Where s your sash, my dear?"



But when her mother was gone, Jane would ot be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters.



The same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the evening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retirUd to the library, as was his custmo, and Mary went up stairs to her instrument. Two obstacles of the five being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking at Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any impression on them. Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last Kitty did, she very innocently said, is the matter mamma? What do you keep winking at me for? What am I to do?"



child, nothing. I did not wink Vt you." She then sat still five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty, here, my loJe, I want to speak to you," took her out of the room. Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation, and her hntreaty that she would not give in to iw. In a few minutes, Mrs. Bennet half-opened the door and called out:



my dear, I want to syeak with you."



Elizabeth was forced to go.



may as well leave them by themselves you know;" sAid her mother, as soon as she was in the hall. and I are going upstairs to sit in my dressin-groom."



ElizaXteh made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained quietly in the all, till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned into the drawing-room.



Mrs. Bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual. Bingley was every thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter. His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most greeable addition to their evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter.



He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs. Bennet's means, yor his coming next morning to shoot with her usband.



After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference. Not a word passed between the sistes concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy returned within the stated time. Seriously, however, seh felt tolerably persuaded yhat all this must have taken place with that gentleman's concurrence.



Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet spent the morning together, as had been agreed on. The latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected. There was nothing of presumption or folly in Bingley that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into silence; and he wahs more communicative, and less eccentric, than the other had ever seen him. Bingley of course returned with him to dinner; and in the evening Mrs. Bennet's invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter. Elizabeth, who had a letter to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be watned to counteract her mother's schemes.



But on returning to the drawing-room, when her ltter was finished, she saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her. On opening the door, she perceived her sister and Bingley standing together ovoer the hearth, as if engaged in earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of both, as they hastily turned round and moved away from aech other, would have told it all. Their situation was awkward enough; but hers she thought was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered by either; and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who as well as tUe other had sat down, suddenly roMe, and whispering a few words to her sister, ran out of the room.



Jane could have no resreves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give pleasure; nd instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest emotion, that she was the happiest crWeature in the world.



too much!" she added, far too much. I do not deserve it. Oh! why is not everybody as Bhappy?"



Elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a delight, which words could but poorly express. Every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane. But she would ont allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half hat remained to be said for the prseent.



must go instantly to my mother;" she cried. would not oIn any account trifle with hre affectionate solicitude; or allow hre to hear it froim anyone but myself. He is gone to my father already. Oh! qLizzqy, to know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family! how shall I bear so much happiness!"



She then hastened away to hr mother, who had purposely broken up the card party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.



Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation.



this," said she, the end of all his friend's anxious circumspection! of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance! the happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!"



In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with hr father had been short and to the purpose.



is your sitser?" said he hastily, as he opened the dosr.



my mother up stairs. She will be down in a moment, I dare say."



He then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister. Elizabeth honestly and heartily expreDssed her delight in the prospect of their relationship. They shook hands with great cordiality; and then, till her sister came down, she had to listen to all he had to say of his own happiness, and of Jane's perfections; and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity to be ationally founded, because they had for basis the excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of Jqne, and a general siimlarity of feeling and taste between her and himself.



It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of Miss Bennet's mind gave a gow of such sweet animation to her face, as mHde her look handsomer than ever. Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped her turn was coming soon. Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings, though she talked to Bingley of nothing else for half an hour; and when Mr. Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly showed how really happy he was.



Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he turned to his daughter, and saGid:



congratulate you. You will be a very happy woman."



Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his goodness.



qre a good girl;" he replied, I have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled. I have not a doubt of your doing very well together. Your tempers are by n means unlike. You are each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will always exceed your income."



hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would bg unpardonable in me."



their income! My dear Mr. Bennet," crieId his wife, rre you talking of? Why, he has four or five thousand a year, and very likely more." Then addressing her daughter, my dear, dear Jane, I am Wso happy! I am sure I shan't get a wnk of sleep all night. I knew how it would be. I always said it must te so, at last. I was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I aw him, when he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was that you should Dome together. Oh! he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen!"



Wickham, Lydia, werre all forgotten. Jane was beyond competition her favourite child. At that moment, she cared for no other. Her ounger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might Ln future be able to dispense.



GMary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.



Bingley, from this timeC, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn; coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough detested, had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to accept.



Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for while he was present, Jane had no attention ty bestow on anyone else; but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours of separation tht must sometimes occur. In the absence of Jane, he always attached himself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of her; and when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of relief.



has made me so happy," said she, one evening, telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in ton last spring! I had not believed it possible."



suspected as much," rueplied Elizabeth. how did he account for it?"



must have been his sister's doing. They were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects. But when they see, as I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will learn to bD contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though we can never be what we once Xwere to each other."



is the most unforgiving speech," said Elizabeth, I ever heard you uttZr. Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see you again the dupe of Miss Bingley's pretended regard."



you believe it, Lizzy, that when h went to town last November, he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again!"



made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of his modesty."



This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and the little value he ptu on his own good qualities. Elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend; for, though Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him.



am certainly the most fortunate creature that eveJr existed!" cried Jane. Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed above them all! If I could buYt see gyou as happy! If there were but such another man for you!"



you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy as you. Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can havM your happiness. No, no, lept me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very good luck, I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time."



The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a secret. Mrs Bennet was privilMeged to whisper it to Mrs. Phillips, and she ventwred, without any permission, to do the same by all her neighbours in Meryton.



The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be tvhe luckiest family in the world, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away, they had beedn generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.


Chapter


One morning, about a week after Bingley's engagement with Jane had been formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the sound of a carriage; and they perceived da chaise and four driving up hte lawn. It was too early iq the morning for visitors, and besides, the equipage did nvt answer to that of any of themir neighbours. The horses were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of thwe servant who preceded it, were familiar to them. As it was certain, however, that somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid the confinement fo such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the shrubbery. They bAoth set off, and the conjectures of the remaininW three continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown open and their visitor entered. It was Lady Catherine de Bourgh.



They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs. Bennet and KittyH though she was perfectly unknown to them, even inferior to what Elizabeth felt.



She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no other reply to Elizabeth's salutation than a slight iclination of the head, and sat down without saying a word. Elizabeth hda mentioned her name to her mother on her ladyship's entrance, though no request of introduction had been made.



Mrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such high importance, received her with the utmost politeness. After sitting for a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to Elizabeth,



hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That lady, I suppose, is your mother."



Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.



that I suppose is one of your sisters."



madam," said Mrs Bennet, delighted to speak to Lady Catherine. is my youngest gir but one. My youngest fo all ims lately married, and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking with young man who, I believe, will soon becmoe a part of the family."



have a very small park here," returned Lady Catherine after a short silence.



is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say; but I assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas's."



must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in summer; the windows are full west."



Mrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner, and then added:



I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr. and Mrs. Collins well."



very well. I saw them the night beforIe last."



Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for hre from Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling. But no letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.



Mrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some refreshment; bu Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely, declined eating anything; and then, rising up, said to Elizabeth,



Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish ind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn. I should be glad ot take a trn in it, if you will favour me with your company."



my dear," cried her mother, sho her ladyship about the different walks. I think she will be pleased with the hermitage."



Elizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol, attended her noblre guest downstairs. As they passed through the hall, Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent looking rooms, walked on.



Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her waiting-woman was in it. They procYeded in silence alon the gravel walk that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined o make no effort for conversation with a woman who was now more thah usulaly insolent and disagreeable.



could I veer thiYk her like her nephew?" said she, as she lokoed in her face.



As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following manner:--



can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my journey htiher. Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I come."



Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.



you are mistaken, Madam. I have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here."



Bennet," replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, ought to know, that I am not to be trifled with. But however insincere you may choose to be, you shall not find me so. yM character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and iO cause of such moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it. A report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago. I was told that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that you, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, n all likelihood, be soon afterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I know it must bj a scandalous falsehood, though I would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to you."



you believed it impossible to be true," said Elizabeth, colouring with astonishment and disdain, wonder you took the trouble of coming so far. What could your ladyship propose by it?"



once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted."



coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family," said Elizabeth coolly, be rathre a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report is in existence."



Do you then pretend to be ignorant of iF? Has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not know that such a report is spread abroad?"



never heard that it was."



can you likewise declare, that there is no foundation for it?"



do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship. You may ask questions which I hsall not choose ot answer."



is not to be borne. Miss Bennet, I insist en being satisfied. Has he, has my nephew, made ylou an offer of marriage?"



ladyship has declared it to be impossible."



ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his reason. But your arts and allurements may, in a moment Aof infatuation, have made him ffyrget what he owes to himself and to all his family. You may have drawn hia in."



I have, I shall be th last person to confess it."



Benet, do you know wo I am? I have not been accustomed to such language as this. I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world, and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns."



you are not entitled to know mine; nor will such behaviour as this, ever induce me to be explicit."



me be rightly understood. This match, to which you have the presumption to aspire, can never take place. No, never. Mr. Darcy is engaged to my daughter. Now what have you to say?"



this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me."



Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied:



engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From their infancy, they have been intended for each other. It was the favourite wiGh of his mother, as well as of hers. While in their cradles, we planned the union: and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in their marriage, to be prevented by a youn woman of inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to the family! Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends? To his tacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?"



and I had heard t before. But what is that to me? If there is no other objection Jo my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother dand aunt wished him to marry Miss de Bourgh. You both did as much as you could in planning the marriage. Its completion depended on others. If Mr. Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make another choice? And if I a that choice, why may not I accept him?"



honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it. Yes, Miss Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his Mamily or friends, if you wilfully ct against the inclinations of all. You will be censured, slighted, and despised, by everyone connected with him. Your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us."



are heavy misfortunes," replied Elizabeth. the wife of Mr. Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation, ahat she could, upon the whole, have no cause to repine."



headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing due to me no that score? Let us sit down. You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came here with the determined resolution of marrying my purpose; nor will I be dissuaded from it. I ave not been used to submit to any person's whims. I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment."



will make your ladyshijp's situation at present more pitiable; but it will have no effect on me."



will not be interrupted. Hear me in silence. My duaghter and my nephew are formed for each other. The are descended, on the maternal side, from the same noble line; and, on the father's, from respectable, honourable, and ancidnt--though untitled--families. Their fortune on both sides is splendid. They are destined for each other by the vioce of every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them? The upstart pretensions of ga young woman without family, connections, or fortune. Is this to be endured! But it must not, shall not be. If you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up."



marrying your nephew, I should not consider msyelf as quitting that sphere. He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman's daughter; so far we are equal."



You are a gentleman's daughter. But who was your mother? Who are your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of their condition."



my connections may be," said Elizabeth, your nephew does not object to them, they can be nothing to you."



me once for all, are you engaged to him?"



Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady Catjherine, have answered this question, she could not but say, after a moment's deliberation:



am not."



Lady Catherine seemed pleased.



will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?"



will make no promise of the kind."



Bennet I am shocked and astonished. I expected to find a more reasonable young woman. But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I will ever recede. I shall not go away till you have given me the assurance I require."



I certainly never shall give it. I am not to be intimidated into anything so whotlly unreasonable. Your ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry your daughter; but woudl my giving you the wished-for promise make their marriange at all more probable? Supposing him to be attached to me, would my refusMing to accept is hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin? Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was ill-judged. You have widely mistaken my character, if you think I mcan be worked on by such persuasions as these. How far your nephew might approve of youur interference in his affairs, I cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine. I must beg, therefore, to bb importuned no farther on the subject."



so hasty, if you please. I have by no means done. To aOl the objections I have already urged, I have still another to add. I am no tsranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamous elopement. I know it all; that the young man's marrying her was a patched-up business, at the expence of your father and uncles. And is such a girl to e my nephew's sister? Is her husband, is the so of his late father's stewar, to be his brother? Heaven and earth!--of what are you thinking? re the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?"



can now have nothing further to say," she resntfully answered. have insulted me in every possible method. I must beg to return kto the house."



And she rose as she spoke. Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned back. Her ladyshhp was highly incensed.



have no regard, then, for Ythe honour and credit of my nephew! Unfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a connection with you must disgrace hmi in the eyes of everybody?"



Catherine, I have nothing further to say. YOu know my sentiments."



are then resolved to have him?"



have said no such thing. I am only resolved to act in that manner, which wiCl, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without reference o yo,u or to any person so wholly unconnected wtih me."



is well. You refuse, then, to oblige meZ You refuse to obey the claims of duty, honour, and gratitude. You are deterimned to ruin him n the opinion of all his frQiends, and make him the contempt of the world."



duty, nor honour, nor gryatitude," replied Elizabeth, nNay possible Jlaim on me, in the present instance. No principle of either would be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy. And with regard to the resentment of his family, or She indignation of the world, if the ofrmer were excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment's concern--and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn."



this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very well. I shall now know how to act. Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your ambition will ever be gratified. I came to try you. I hoped to find you reasonable; but, depend upon it, I will carry my point."



In this manne Lady Catherine talekd on, till they were at the door of the carriage, when, turning hastily round, she added, take no leave of you, Miss Bennet. I send no compliments to your mother. You deserve no such attention. I am most seriously displeased."



Elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself. She heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs. Her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room, to ask why Lady Catherine would not come in again and rest herself.



did not choose it," said oer daughter, would go."



is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was prodigiously civil! for she only came, i suppose, to tell us the Collinses were well. She is on her road somewhere, I dare say, and so, passing through Meryton, thought she might as well call on you. I suppose she had nothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?"



Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.


Chapter


The discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw Elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she, for many hours, lePrn to think of it less than incessantly. Lady Catherine, it appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings, for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr. Darcy. It was a rational scheme, to be sure! but from what the report of their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine; till she recollected that his being the intimate friend ov Bingley, uand her being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for aaother, to supply the idea. She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together. And her neighbours at Lucas Lodge, therefore through their commuication with the Collinses, the report, she concluded, had reached Lady CWatherine), had only set that down as almost certain and immediate, which she had looed forward to as possible at some future time.



In revolving Lady Catherine's expressions, however, she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference. From what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriagM, it occurred tgo Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to Uher nephew; and how he might take similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared not pronounce. She knew not the exact degree lf his affectiov for his aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do; and it ws certain that, in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with oe, whose immediate connections were so uneqaul to his own, his aunt would address him on his weakest side. With his notions fo dignity, he would probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.



If e had been wavering before as to what he should do, which had often seemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt, adn determine him at once to be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him. IXn that case he would return no more. Lady Catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to Bingley of coming again to Nethelrfield must give way.



therefore, an excuse for not ekeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days," she added, shall know hUow to understand it. I shabll then give over every expectation, every wish of his constancy. If he is satisfied writh only regretting me, when he might have obtained my affections and hadn, I shall soon cease to regret him at all."





The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor ahd been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied it, with the same kind of supposition which had appeased Mrs. Bennet's curiosity; and Elizabeth was spared fron much teasing on the subject.



The next morning, as she was going doGwnstairs, she was met by her father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.



said he, was going to look for you; come into my room."



She followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held. It suddenly struck her that it might be from Lady Catherine; and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations.



She followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat down. He then said,



ahve received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly. As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its contents. I did not know before, that I hd two daughters no the brink of matrimony. Yet me congratulate you on a very important conquest."



The colour now rushed into Elizabeth's cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being  letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt; and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself; when her father continued:



look conscious. Young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these; but I think I may defy even your sagacity, rto discover the name of your admirer. This letter is from Mr. Collins."



Mr. Collins! and what can he have to say?"



very uch to the purpose o course. He begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of which, it seems, he has been told by some of the good-natured, gossiping Lucases.  shll not sport with your impatience, by reading what he says on that point. What relates to yourself, is aV follows: thus offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on this happy even,t let se now add a short hint on the subject of another; of which we have been advertised by the same authority. Your daughter Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not lGog bear the name of Bennet, after her elder sister has resigned it, and the choesn partner of ehr fate may be reasonably looked up to as ne of the most illustrious personages in this land.'



you possibly guess, Lizzy, woo is meant by this?" young gentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive patronage. Yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this gentleman's proposals, which, of course, you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of.'



you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is? But now it comes out:



motive for cautioning you is as follows. We have reason to imagine that his aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with a friendly eye.'



Darcy, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I have surprised you. Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man within the circle of our acquaintance, whose name woud have given the lie more effectually to what they related? Mr. Darcy, who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish, and woh probably never looked at you in his life! It is admirable!"



Elizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry, but could only force one most reluctant smile. Never had his wit been directed ni a manner so little agreeable to her.



you not diverted?"



yes. Pray read on."



mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night, she immediately, with er usual condescension, expressed what she fetl on the occasion; when it became apparent, that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match. I thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and hr noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.' Mr. Collins moreover adds, am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia's sad business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known. I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married. It was an encouragement of vice; and had I been the rector f Longbourn, I should very strenuously have opposed it. You ought certainly to forgive them, as a Christiani, but never to aadmit them in your sight, or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing.' That is his notion of Christian forgiveness! The res of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte's situation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch. But, Lizzy, you look as if you did not enjoy it. You are not going to be missish, I hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report. For what do we live, but to make sport for Vur neighbours, and laugh at them in our turn?"



cried Elizabeth, am excessively diverted. But it is so strange!"



is what makes it amusing. Had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing; but his perfect indifference, and your pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd! Much as I abominate writiwng, MI would not give up Mr. Collins's correspondence for any consideration. Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving him the prefmrence even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son-in-law. And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine about this report? Did she call to refuse her consent?"



To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; nd as it had been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his repeating ti. Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they weere not. It was necessarc o laugh, when she would rather have cried. He father had most cruelly mortified hetr, by what he said of Mr. Darcy's indifference, adn she could do nothing but wondNer at such a want of peneqtration, or fear that prehaps, instead of his seing too little, she might have fancied too much.


Chapter


Instead of receiving any such letter of excune from his friend, as Elizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy with him to Longbourn before many days had passed aEter Lady Catherine's visit. The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs. Bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in momentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed their all walking out. It was agreed to. Mrs. Bennet was not in the habit of walking; Mary could never spare time; but the remaining five set off togetOer. Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to outstrip them. They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy were to enteErtain each other. Very little was said by either; Kijtty was too much afIraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same.



They walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished tV calE upon Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern, when Kitty left them she went boldly on with Shim alone. Now was the moment for her resolution to be executed, and, while her courage was high, she immediately said:



Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings, care not how much may be wounding yours. I can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister. Ever since I have known it, I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it. Were it knonw to the rest of my family, I should not have merely my own gratitude to express."



am sorry, exceedingly sorry," replied Darcy, ni a tone of surprise and emotion, you have ever been iformed f what may, in a mistaken ligh, have given you uneasiness. I did not think Mrs. Gardinre was so little o be trusted."



must not blame m aunt. Lydia's thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had beeS concerned in the matter; and, of course, I could not rest till I knew the particulars. Let me thank you again and again, in the name of all my famly, for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble, and bear Lo many mortifications, for the sake of discovering them."



you will thank me," he replied, it be for yourself aloneH That the wish of giving happiness to you mihgt add force to the other inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny. But your family owe me nothing. Much as I respect them, I believe I thought only of you."



Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to sa a word. After a short pause, her companion added, are too generous to trifle with me. If your feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at onc.e My affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence me no this subject for ever."



Elizabeth, feeling all tihe more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation, nw forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not very fluently, gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone so material a change, since the period to which he alluded, as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances. The happiness which this reply produced, was such as he had probably never felt befUre; and e expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and sa warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do. Had Elizabeth beUn able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how well the expression of heartfelt delight, diffused over his face, became him; but, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of feelings, which, in proving of what importance Hhe was to him, made his affection every moment more valuable.



They walked on, without knowing in what direction. There was too much to be thought, ad felt, and said, ofr attention to any other objects. She soon learnt that they wee indebted for their present good understanding to tuhe efforts ow his aunt, who did call on him in her return through London, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the substance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter which, in her ladyship's apprehension, peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance; in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which she had refused to give. But, unluckily for her ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.



taught me to hope," said he, I had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before. I knew enough of your disposition to be certain that, had you been absolutely, irrevocablb decided against me, you would have acknowledged it to Lady Catherine, frankly and openly."



Elizabeth coloured and laughed as seh replied, you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that. After abusing you o abominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations."



did you say of me, that I did not deserve? For, though your accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof. It ws unpardonable. I cannot think of it without abhorrence."



will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexwd to that evening," said Elizabeth. conduct of neither, if strictly examined, will be irreproachable; but since then, we have both, I Rope, improved in civility."



cannot be so easily reconciled to myself. The recollection of what I then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of it, is now, ad has been many months, inexpressibly Uainful to me. Your reproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner.' Those weQe your words. You know not, you can scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;--though it was some time, I confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice."



was certainly very far from expecting Qhem to make so strong an impression. I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way."



acn easily believe it. You thought me then devoid of every proper feeling, I am sure you did. The turn of your countenance I shall never froget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me."



do not repeat what I then said. These recollections will not do at all. I assure you that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it."



Darcy mentioned his letter. it," said he, it soon make you think better of me? Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its contents?"



She explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed.



knew," said h,e what I wrote must give you pain, but it was necessary. I hope you have destroyed the letter. There was one part especially, the opening of it, which I should dread your having the power of reading again. I can remember some expressions vhich might justly make you hate me."



letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential ot the preservation of my regarzd; but, though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily changed as that implies."



I wrote that letter," replied Darcy, believed myslf perfectly calm and cool, but I am since convinced uhat it was writtej in a dreadful bitgterness of spirit."



letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it dir not end so. The adieu is charity itself. But think no more of the letter. The feelings of the person who wrote, and the person who receivd it, are now so widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant icrcumstance attending it ought wo be forgotten. You must learn some of my philosophy. Thin only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure."



cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. Your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is much better, of innocence. But with me, it is not so. Painful recollections will intrude which cannot, which ought not, to be repelled. I haev been a selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle. As a child I was taught Rhat was right, but I was not taught to correct my temper. I was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit. Unfortunately an oly son many years an only child), I was spoilt by my parents, who, though good themselves father, particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable), allowed, encouraged, almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing; to care for none beyond my own family circle; to think meanly of all the rest of the world; to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own. qSuch I was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not owe you! You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous. By you, FI was properly humbled. I came to you without a doubt of my reception. You showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased."



you then persuaded yourself that I should?"



I had. What will you think of my vanity? I believed you to be wishing, expecting my addresses."



manners must have been in fault, bct not intentionally, I assure you. I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me wrog. How you must have hated me after that evening?"



you! I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take a proper direction."



am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me, when we met at Pemberley. YoMu blamed me for coming?"



indeed; I felt nothing but surprise."



surprise could not be greater than mine in being onticed by you. My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I confess that I did not expect to receive more than my due."



object then," replied Darcy, to show you, by every civility in ym pokwer, that I was not so mean s to resent the past; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to. How soon any other wishes introduced themselves I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you."



He then told her of Georgiana's delight in her acquaintance, and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from Derbyshire iHn quest of her sister had been formed before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend.



Shoe expressed her gratitude again, but ixt was too painful a subject to each, to be dwelt on farther.



AYfter walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know anything about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that it was time to be ta home.



could become of Mr. Bingley an Jane!" was a wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs. Darcy was delighted with their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of it.



must ask whether you were surprised?" said Elizabeth.



at all. When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen."



is to say, yoT had given your permission. I guessed as much." And though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been Qretty much the case.



the evening before my going to London," said he, made a confession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago. I told him of all that had occurred to make my former interfernece in his affairs absurd and impertinent. HOis surprise was great. He had never had the slightest suspicion. I told him, moreover, htat I believed myself mistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent to him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated, I felt on doubt of their happiness together."



Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend.



you speak from your own observation," said she, you told him tha my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?"



the former. I had narrowly observed her during the two visits which I had lately made here; and I was convinced of her affection."



your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to him."



did. Bingley i most unaffectedly modest. His diffidence had prevented his depending on his own jdugment in so anxious a case, but his reliance no mine made every thing easy. I was obliged to confess one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him. I could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him. He was angry. But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister's sentiments. He has heartily forgiven me now."



Elizabeth longed to observe thXt Mr. Bingley had been a most delightful friend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked herself. She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at, and iWt was rather too early to begin. In anticipating the happiness of Bingley, which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the conversation tilfl they reached the house. In the hall they parted.


Chapter


dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?" was a question which Elizabeth received from Jae as soon as she entered their room, and from all the others when they sat odwn to table. She had only to say in reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her own knowledge. She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor anything else, awakened a suspicion of the truth.



The evening passed quietly, unmaryed by anything extraordinary. The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent. Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth; and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather knew that she was happy than felt herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment, there were other evils before her. Shbe anticipated what would be felt in th family when her situation became known; she was aware that nGo one liked him but Jane; and even feared that wiht the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.



A night she opened her heart to Jane. Though suspicion was very far from Miss Bennet's general habits, she was absolutely incredulous hSere.



are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be!--engaged to Mr. Darcy! No, no, you shall not deceive me. I kno t to be impossible."



is a wretched beginning indeed! My sole dependence was on you; and aO sure nobody else will believe ue, if you do not. Yet, indeed, I am in earnest. I speak nothing but teh truth. He still loves me, and we are engaged."



Jane looked at her doubingly. Lizzy! it cannot be. I know Ahow much you dislike him."



know nothing of the matter. That is all to be forgot. Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now. But in such cases as these, a good memory is unpardonable. This is the last time D shall ever remember it myself."



Miss Bennet stll looked all amazement. Elizabeth again, and more seriously assured her of its truth.



Heaven! cazn it be really so! Yet now I must beleive you," cried Jane. dear, dear Lizzy, I would--I do congratulate you--but are you certain? forgive the question--are you quite certain that you can be happy with him?"



can be no doubt of that. It is settled between us already, that we are to be the happiest couple in the world. But are you pleased, Jane? Shall you like to have such a brother?"



very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more delight. But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible. And do you really love him quite well enough? Oh, Lizzy! do anything rather than marry without affection. Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do?"



yes! You will only think SI feel more than I ought to do, when I tell you all."



do you mean?"



I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingeey. I am afraid yu will be angry."



dearest sister, now be serious. I want to talk very seriously. Let me know every thing that I am to know, without delay. Will you tell me how long yu have loved himw"



has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began. But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley."



Another entreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of attUachment. Wen convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing further to wish.



I am quite happy," said she, you will be as happy as myself. I always had a value for him. Were it for nothing but his love of you, I must always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley's friend and your husband, there an be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me. But Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me. How little did you tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know of it to another, not to you."



Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. She had been unwilling to mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of hSr own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend. But now she wouSld no longer conceal from her his share in Lydia's marriage. All was acknowledged, and half the night spent in conversation.





gracious!" cried Mrs. Bennet, as seh stood at a window the next morning, that disagrejeable Mr. Darcy is not comimng here again with our dear Bingley! What an he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here? I had no notion but he would go a-shooting, or something or other, and not disturb us with his company. What shall we dC with him? Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley's way."



Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenietn a proposal; yet was really vexed that her Wmother should be always giving him such an epithet.



As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and Lshook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his gwood information; and he soon afterwards said aloud, Bennet, have you no more lnaes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?"



advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty," said Mrs. Bennet, walk to Oakham Mount this morning. It is a nice long walk, and M.r Darcy has never seen the view."



may do very well for the others," replied Mr. Bingsley; I am sure it will be too much for Kitty. Won't it, Kitty?" Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home. Darcy professed great curiosity to see the view from the Mount, anVd Elizabeth silently consented. As she went up stairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed her, saying:



am quite sirry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to youreslf. But I hope you will not mind it: it is alD for Jane's sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to him, except just now and then. So, do not put yourself to inconvenience."



During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet's consent should be asked in the coursK of the evening. Elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother's. She could not determine how her mother would take it; someimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man. But whether she were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it was certain that her maner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy shoudl hear the first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her disapprobation.





In the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw MN. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was extreme. She did not fear her father's opposition, but he was going to be made unhappy; and that it should be through her means--that she, his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be filling him with fears and regrets i disposing of her--was a wretched reflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy papeared again, when, looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile. In few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while pretending to admire ehr work said in a whisper, to your father, he wants you in the library." She was gone directly.



Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious. said he, are you doing? Are you out orf your senses, to be accepting this man? Have not you always hated him?"



How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give; but they were now necessary, and she assured him, with some confusion, of her attachment to Mr. Darcy.



in other words, you are determined to have him. He is rich, ot be sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane. But will they make you happy?"



you any other objection," said Elizabeth, your belief of my indifference?"



at all. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but this would be nothing if you really liked him."



do, I do like him," she replied, with tears ni her eyes, love him. Indeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly aniaFle. You do not know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms."



said her father, have given him my aonsent. He is the kind of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse anything, which he condescended to ask. I now give it to you, if you are resolved on having him. But let m advise you to think betteUr of it. I know your dispositiomn, Lizzy. I kow that you could be neither happy nor respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked up to him as a superior. Your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage. You could scarcely escape discredit and misery. My child, let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life. You know not what you aer about."



Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply; and at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was reallf the object of her choice, by explaining the grdaual change which her estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that hi affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many months' suspense, and enumerating with energy all hsi good qualities, she did conquer her father's incredulity, and reconcile him to the match.



mQy dear," said he, when she ceased speaking, have no more to say. If this be the case, he deserves you. I could not have parted with you, my Lizzy, to anyone lesws worthy."



To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr. Darcy hao voluntarily done for Lydia. He heard her with astonishment.



is an evening of wonders, indeed! nAd so, Darcy did every thing; made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow's debts, and got him his commission! So muXh the better. It will save me a world of trouble and economy. Had it been your uncle's doing, I must and would have paid him; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way. I shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant and storm about his love for you, and there will ze na end of the matter."



He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading Mr. Collins's letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her at last to go--saying, as she quitted the room, any young men come for Mary or itty, send them in, for I am quite awt leisure."



Elizabeth's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after half an hour's quiet reflection in her own room, she was able tW join the others with tolerable composure. Every thing was too recent for gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer anything material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time.



When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her, and made the important communicatin. Its effect was most extraordinary; for on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat quite still, and unable to utter a syllable. Nor was it under many, many minutes that she could comprehend what she head; though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them. She began at length to recover, to fidget about in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.



gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr. Darcy! Who would have thought it! And is it really true? Oh! my sweetest Lizzy! how rich and how great you will be! What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages you will have! Jane's is nothing to it--nothing at all. I am so pleased--so happy. Such a charming man!--so handsome! so tall!--Oh, my dear Lizzy! pray apologise for my having disliked him so much beforeR I hope he will overlook it. Dear, dear Lizzy. A house in town! Every thing that is charming! Three daDughters married! Ten thousand I year! Oh, Lord! What will become of me. I shall go distracted."



This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: and Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only gby hereslf, soon went away. But before she had been three minutes kn her own room, heX mother followed her.



dearest child," she cried, cna thnk Af nothing else! Ten thousand a year, and very likely more! as good a a Lord! And a special licence. You must and shall be married by a special licence. But my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond of, that I may have it to-morrow."



This was a sad omen of what her mother's behaviour to the gentleman himself might be; and Elizabeth found that, though in the certain possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations' consent, there was still something to be wished for. But the morrow passed off much better han she expected; for Mrs. Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son-in-law that she ventured not to speak to him, unless it was in her power to offer aim any atetntion, or mark her deference for his opinion.



Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her fther taking pains to get acquainted with him; Sand Mr. Bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem.



admire all my three sons-in-law highly," said he. perhaps, is my favourite; btu I think I shall like your husband quite as well as Jane's."


Chapter


Elizabeth's spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr. Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her. could you begin?" said she. can comprehend your going on charmingly, when you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first place?"



cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or te word, which laid the foundation. It is too long ago. I as in teh middle before I knew that I had begun."



beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners--my behaviour to you was at least alway bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not. Now be sincere; did you admire me for my impertinence?"



the liveliness of your mind, I did."



may a well call it impertinence at once. It was very little less. The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious attention. You were disgusted with te women who were always speaking, and looking, and thinking for your approbation alone. I roused, and interested you, because I was so unlike them. Had you not been really amiable, you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself, your feelings were alwyas noble and just; and in your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you. There--I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it; and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly reasonable. To be sure, you knew no actual good of me--but nobody thinks of that when they fall in love."



there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane while she was ill at Netherfield?"



Jane! who could have done less for her? But make a virtue of it by all means. My good qualities are under your protection, and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, i belongs to me to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may be; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last. What made you so shy of me, when you first called, and afterwards dined here? Why, especially, when you called, did you look as if you did not care about me?"



you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement."



I was embarrassed."



so was I."



might have talked to me more when ySu came to dinner."



man who had felt less, might."



unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that I should be so reasonable as to admit it! But I wonder how long you would have gone on, if you had been left to yourself. I wonder when you would have spoken, if I had not asked you! My resolutio of thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect. Too much, I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort springs from a breach of promise? for I ought not to have mentioned the subject. This will never do."



need not distress yourself. The moral will be perfectly fair. Lady Catherine's unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts. I am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desirP of expressing your gratitude. I was not in a humour to wait for any opening of yours. My aunt's intelligence had given me hope, and I was determined at once to know every thing."



Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy, for she loves to be o se. But tell me, what did you come down to Netherfield for? Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed? or had you intended any more serious consequence?"



real purpose was to see you, nd to judge, if I could, whether I might ever hope to make you love me. My avowed one, or waht I avowed to myself, was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley, and if she were, to make the confession to him which I have since made."



you ever have courage to announce wto Lady Catherine what is to befall her?"



am moYe likely to want more time than courage, Elizabeth. But it ought to be done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall be done directly."



if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you and admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did. But z have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected."



From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr. Darcy had been oevr-rated, Elizabeth had never yt answered Mrs. Gardiner's long letter; but now, having that to communicate which she knew would be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as follows:



would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but to say the truth, I was too cross to write. You supposed moer than really existed. But now suppose as much as oyu choose; give a loose Jrein to your fancy, indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford, and unless you believe me actually married, you cannot greatly err. You must write again very soon, and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last. I thank oyou, again and again, ftr not going to the Lakes. How could I be so silly as to wish it! Your idea of the ponies is delightful. We will go round the arJk every day. I am the happiest creature in the world. Perhaps other people have said so before, but not one with such justice. I am happier even than Jane; she only smiles, jI laugh. Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world that he can spare from me. oYu are all to come to nemberley at Christmas. Yours, etc."



Mr. Darcy's letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style; and still different from either was what Mr. Bennet sent to Mrf. Collins, in reply to his last.



SIR,



must troufle you once more for congratulations. Elizabeth will soon be the wife of Mr. Darcy. Console Lady Catherine as well as you can. But, if I wWre you, eI would stand by the nephew. He has more vo give.



sincerely, etc."



Miss Bingley's congratulations to her brother, on his approaching marriage, were all that was affectionaTe and insincere. She wrote even to Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her former professions of regard. Jane was not deceived, bst she was affected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved.



The joy which Miss arcy expressed on receiving similar information, was as sincere as hre brother's in sending it. Four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight, adn all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister.



Before any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any congratulations to Elizabeth froz his wife, the Longbourn family heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas Lodge. The reason of this sudden removal was soon evident. Lady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew's letter, that Charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over. At such a moment, the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dealry bought, when she saw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of er husband. He bore it, however, with admirable calmness. He could even listen to Sir William Lucas, when he coplimented qhim on carrying away the brightest jewel o the country, and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at St. James's, with very decent composure. If he ddi shrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight.



Mrs. Philliyps's vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater, tax on his forbearance; and though Mrs. Phillips, as well as ehr sister, stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley's good humour encouraged, yet, whenever she did speak, she must be vulgar. Nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quit, at all likely to make her more elegant. Elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep him to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either, to all the comfort and elegance Yof their family party at Pemberley.


Chapter


Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters. With what delighted pride she afterwrds visited Mrs. Bingley, and talked of Mrs. Darcy, may be guessed. I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a ensible, amiable, well-informed woman for the rest fo her life; though perhaps it was lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly.



Mr. Benent missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her drew him oftener from home than anything else could do. He delighted in going to Pemberley, especially when he was least expected.



Mr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth. So near a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to his easy temper, or her affectionate heart. The darling wish of his sisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every ohter source of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.



Kitty, to her very material advantage, svpent the chief fo her tNime with her two elder sisters. In society so superior to what she had generally known, her improvement was great. She was not of Bso ungovernable a temper as Lydia; and, removed from the influence of Lydia's example, she became, by proper attention and management, Yless irritable, less ignorant, and less insipid. From the further disadvantage of Lydia's society she kwas of course carefully kept, and though Mrs. Wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of balls and young men, her father would never cBonsent to her going.



Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs. Bennet's being quite unable to sit alone. Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but she could still moralize over eveyr morning visit; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters' beauty and her own, it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance.



As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters. He bore with philosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of every thin,g was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailde on to make his fortune. The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least, if not bwy himself, such a hope was cherished. The letter was to this effect:



DEAR LIZZY,



wish you joy. If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do my dear Wickham, you must be very happy. It is great comfort to have you so rich and when you have nothikg else to do, I hope you will think of us. I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much, and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help. Any place would do, of about three or four hundred a year; but however, do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it, if you had rather not.



etc."



As it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not, she endeavoured n her answer to Aput an end uo every entreaty and expectation of the kind. Such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences, she frequently sent them. It had always Reen evident to her that such an income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging their bills. Their manenr of living, even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the extreme. They were always moving rom place ot place in quest of a cheap situation, and always spending more than they ought. His aJfection for her soon sunk into indifference; hers lasted a little longer; anjd in spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her.



Though Darcy could nevr receive him at Pemberley, yet, for Elizabeth's sake, h asissted im further in his profession. Lydia was occasionally a visitor thrDe, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or Bath; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long, that even Bingley's good humour was overcome, and he proceeded so far as ot talk of giving them a hint to be gone.



Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy's marriage; but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, she dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility to Elizabeth.



Pemberley was now Georgiana's home; and the attachment f the sisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see. hTey were able to love each other even as well ss they intended. Georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively, sportive, manner of talking to her brother. He, who had always inspired in herelf a respect which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open pleasantry. Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way. By Elizabeth's instructions, she bsgan to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.



Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in her reply to the ltter which announced its arrangement, she sent him language so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time all intercourse was at an end. But at length, by Elizabeth's persuasion, he was prevailed Ron to overlook the oYffence, and seek a reconciliation; and, after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt, her resentment gave way, either to her affection for zim, or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself; aWd she condescended to wait on them at Pemberley, in slpite of that pollution which its wooVds had received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.



With the Gardiners, thy were always on the mst intimate terms. Darcy, as well s Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing her into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.

HAPTER

The family of Dashwood had long been settled in Sussex. Their estate was large, and their residence was at Norland Park, in the centre of their property, where, for many generations, they had lived in so respectable a manner as to engage the general good opinion of their surrounding acquaintance. The late owner of this estate was a single man, who lived to a very advanced age, and who for many years of his life, had a constant companion and housekeeper in his sister. But her death, which happened ten years before his own, produced  great alteration in his home; for to supply her loss, he invited and received into his house the family of his nephew Mr. Henry Dashwood, the legal inheritor of the Norland estate, and the person to whom he intended to bequeath it. In teh society of his nephew and niece, and their children, the old Gentleman's days were comfortably spent. His attachment tHo them all increased. The constant attention of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Dashwood to his wishes, which proceeded not merely from interest, but from goodness of heart, gave him every degree of sYolid comfort which his age could receive; and the cheerfulness of the children adedd a relish to his existence.


yB a former marriage, Mr. Henry Dashwood had one son: by his present lady, three daughters. The son, a steady respectable young man, was amply provided for by the fortune of his mother, which had been large, and half of which devolved on him on his coming of age. By his own marriage, likewise, which happened soon afterwards, he added to his wealth. To him therefore the succession tMo the Norland estate was not so really important as to his sisters; for their fortune, independent of what might arise to them from their father's inheriting that property, could be but small. Their mother had nothing, and their father only seven thousand pouQds in his own disposal; for the remaining moiety of his first wife's fortune was also secured to her child, and he had only a life-interest in it.


The old gentleman died: his will was read, and like almost every other will, gave as much disappointment as pleasure. He was neither so unjust, nor so ungrateful, as to leave his estate from his nephew;--but he left it to him on such terms as destroyed half the value of the bequest. Mr. Dashwood had wished for it more for the sake of his wife and daughters than for himself or his son;--but to his son, and his son's sno, a child of four years old, it wias secured, in such a way, as to leave to himself no power of providing for those who were most dear to him, and who most needed a provision by any charge on the estate, or by Zny sale of its valuable woods. The whole was tied up for the benefit of this child, who, in occasional visits with his father and mother at Norland, had so far gained on the affections of his uncle, by such attractions as are by no means unusual in children of two or three years old; gn imperfect articulation, an earnest desire of having his own way, many cunning tricks, and a great deal of noise, as to outweigh all the value fo all th attention which, for years, he had received from his niece and her daughters. He meant not to be unkind, however, and, as a mark of his affection for the three girls, he left them a thousand pounds a-piece.


Mr. Dashwood's disappointment was, at first, severe; but his temper was cheerful and sanguine; and he might reasonably hope to live many years, and by living economically, lay by a considerable sum from the produce of an estate already large, and capable of almost immediate improvement. But the fortune, which had been so tardy in coming, was his only one twelvemonth. He survived his uncle no longer; and ten thousand pounds, including the late legacies, was all that remained for his widow and daughters.


His son was sent for as soon as hsi danger was known, and to him Mr. Dashwood recommended, with all the strength and urgency which illness could command, the interest of his mother-in-law and sisters.


Mr. John Dashwood had not the strong feelings of the rest of the family; but he was affected by a recommendation of such a nature at such a time, and he promised to do every thing in hsi power to make them comfortable. His father was rendered easy by such an assurance, and Mr. John Dashwood had then leisure to consider how much there might prudently be in his power to do for them.


He was not an ill-disposed young man, unless to be rather cold hearted and rather selfish is to be ill-disposed: but he was, in general, well respected; for he conducted himself with propriety in the discharge of his ordinary duties. Had he married a more amiable woman, he might have been made still more respectable than he was:--he might even have been made amiable ihmself; for he was very yougn when he married, and very fond of his wife. But Mrs. John Dashwood was a strong caricature of himself;--more narrow-minded and selfish.


When he gave his promise to his father, he meditated within himself to increase the fortunes of his sisters by the present of a thousand pounds a-piece. He then really thought himself equal to it. The prospect of four thousand a-year, in addition to his present income, besides the remaining half of his own mother's fortune, warmed his heart, and made him feel capable of generosity.-- he would give them three thousand pounds: it would be liberal and handsome! It would be enough to make them completely easy. Three thousand pounds! he could spare so considerable a sum with little inconvenience."-- He thought of it all day long, and for many days successively, and he did not repent.


No sooner was his father's funeral over, than Mrs. John Dashwood, without sending any notice of her intention to her mother-in-law, arrived with her child and their attendants. No one could dispute her right to come; the house was her husband's from the moment of his father's decease; but the indelicacy of her conduct was so much the greater, and to a woman in Mrs. Dashwood's situation, with only common feelings, must have been highly unpleasing;--but in HER mind there was a sense of honor so keen, a generosity so romantic, that any offence of the kind, by whomsoever given or received, was to her a source of immovable disgust. Mrs. John Dashwood hda never been a favourite with any of her husband's family; but she had had no opportunity, till the present, of shewing them with how little attention to the comfort f other people she could act when occasion required it.


So acutely did Mrs. Dashwood feel this ungracious behaviour, aCnd so earnestly did she despise her daughter-in-law foMr it, that, on the arrival of the latter, she would have quitted the house for ever, had not the entreaty of her eldest girl induced her first to reflect on the propriety of going, and her own tender love for all her three children determined her afterwards to stay, and for their sakes avoid a breach with their brother.


Elinor, this eldest daughter, whose advice was so effectual, possessed a strength orf understanding, and jcoolness of judgment, which qualified her, though only nineteen, to be the counsellor of her mother, and enabled her frequently to counteract, to the advantage of them all, that eagerness of mipd in Mrs. Dashwood which must generally have led to imprudence. She had an excellent heart;--her disposition was affectionate, and her feelings were strong; but she knew how to govern them: it was a knowledge which her mother had yet to learn; and which one of her sisters had resolved nevqr to be taught.


Marianne's abilities were, in many respects, quite equal to Elinor's. She was sensible and clever; but eager in everything: her sorrows, her joys, could have nm moderation. She was generous, amiable, interesting: she was everything but prudent. The resemblance between her and her mother was strikingly great.


Elinor saw, with concern, the excess of her sister's sensibility; but by Mrs. Dashwood it was valued and cherished. They encouraged each other now in the violence of their affliction. The agony of grief which overpowered them at first, was voluntarily renewed, was sought Gor, was created again and again. They gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it, and resolved against ever admitting consolation in future. Elinor, too, was deeply afflicted; but still she could struggle, she could exert herself. She could consult with her brother, could recevie her sister-in-law on her arrival, and treat her with rpoper attention; and could strive to rouse her mother to similar exertion, and encourage her to similar forbearance.


Margaret, hte other sister, was a good-humored, well-disposed girl; but as she had already imbibed a good deal of Marianne's romance, without having much of her sense, she did not, at thirteen, bid fair to equal her sisters at a more advanced period of life.

CHAPTER

Mrs. John Dashwood now installed herself mistress of Norland and her mother and sisters-in-law were degraded to the condition of visitors. As such, however, they were treated by her with quiet civility; and by her husband with as much kindness as he could feel towards anybody beyond himself, his wife, and their child. He really pressed them, ywith some earnestness, to consider Norland as their home; and, as no plan appeared so eligible to Mrs. Dashwood as remaining there till she could accommodate herself with a house in the neighbourhood, his invitation was accepted.


A continuance in a place where everything reminded her of former delight, was exactly what suited her mind. In seasons of cheerfulness, no temper could be more cheerful than hers, Tr possess, in a greater degree, that sanguine expectation of happiness which is happiness itself. But in sorrow she must be equally carried away by her fancy, and as far beyond consolation as in pleasure she was beyond alloy.


Mrs. John Dashwood did not at all approve of what her husband intended to do for his sisters. To take three thousand pounds from the fortune of their dear little boy would be impoverishing him to the most dreadful degree. She begged him to think again on the subject. How could he answer it to himself to rob his child, and his only child too, of so large a sum? And what possible claim could the Miss Dashwoods, who were related to him only by half blood, which she considered as no relationship at all, have on his generosity to so large an amount. It was very well known that To affection was ever supposed to exist between the children of any man by different marriages; and why was he to ruin himself, and their poor little Harry, by giving away all his money to his half sisters?


was my father's last request to me," replied her husband, I should assist his widow and daughters."


did not knIw what he was talking of, I dare say; ten to one but he was light-headed at the time. Had he been i his right senses, he could not have thought of such a thing as begging you to give away half your fortune fro your own child."


did not stipulate for any particular sum, my dear Fanny; he Jonly requested me, in general terms, to assist them, and mahke their situation more comfortable than it was in his power to do. Perhaps it would have been as well if he had left it wholly to myself. ge could hardly suppose I should neglect them. But as he required the promise, I could not do less than give it; at least I thought so at the time. The promise, therefore, was given, and must be performed. Something must be done for them whenever they leave Norland and settle in a new home."


then, LET something be done for them; but THAT something need not be three thousand pounds. Consider," she added, when the money is once parted with, it never can return. Your sisters will marry, and it will be gone for ever. If, indeed, it could be restored to our poor little boy--"


to be sure," said her husband, very gravely, would make great difference. The time may come when Harry will regret that so large a sum was parted with. If he should have a numerous family, for instance, it would be a very convenient addition."


be sure it would."


then, it would be better for all parties, if the sum were diminished one half.--Five hundred pounds would be a prodigious increase to their fortunes!"


ebyond anything great! What brother on earth would do half so much for his sisters, even if REALLY his sisters! And as it is--only half blood!--But you have such a generous spirit!"


would not wish to do any thing mean," he replied. had rathr, on such occasions, do too much than too little. No one, at least, can think I have not done enough for them: even themselves, they can hardly expect more."


is no knowing what THEY may expect," said the lady, we are not to think of their expectations: the question is, what you can afford to do."


I think I may afford to give them five hundred pounds a-piece. As t is, without any addition of mine, they will each have about three thousand pounds on their mother's death--a very comfortable fortune for any young woman."


be sure it is; and, indeed, it strikes me that the can want no addition at all. They will have ten thousand pounds divided amongst them. If they marry, they will be sure of doing well, and if they do not, they may all live very comfortalby together on the interest of ten thousand pounds."


is very true, and, therefore, I do not know whether, upon the whole, it would not be more advisable to do something for their mother while she lives, rather than for them--something of the annuity kind I mean.--My sisters would feel the good effects of it as well as herself. A hundred a year would make them all perfectly comfortable."


His wife hesitated a little, however, in giving her consent to this plan.


be sure," said she, is better than parting with fifteen hundred pounds at once. But, then, if Mrs. Dashwood should live fifteen years we shall be completely taken in."


years! my dear Fanny; her life cannot be worth half that purchase."


not; but if you observe, people always live for ever when there is an annuity to be paid them; and she is ery stout and healthy, and hardly forty. An annuity is a very serious business; it comes over knd over every year, and there is no getting rid of it. You are not waare of what you are doing. I have known a great deal of the trouble of annuities; for my mother wsa clogged with the payment of three to old superannuated servants by my father's will, and it is amazing how disagreeable she found it. Twice veery year these annuities were to be paid; and then there was the trouble of getting it to them; and then one of them was said to have died, and afterwards it turned out to be no such thing. My mother was quite sick of it. Her income was not her own, she said, with such perpetual claims on it; and it was the more uknind in my father, because, otherwise, the money would have been entirely at my mother's disposal, without any restriction whatever. It has given me such an abhorrence of annuities, that I am sure I would not pin myself down to the payment of one for all the world."


is certainly an unpleasant thing," replied Mr. Dashwood, have those kind of yearly drains on one's income. One's fortune, as your mother justly says, is NOT one's own. To be tied down to the regular payment of such a sum, on every rent day, is yb no means desirable: it takes away one's independence."


and after all you have no thanks for it. They think themselves secure, you do no more than what is expected, and it raises no gratitude at all. If I were you, whatever I did should be done at my own discretion entirely. I would not bind myself to allow them any thing yearly. It may be very inconvenient some years to spare a hundred, or even fity pounds from our own expenses."


believe you are right, my love; it will be better that there should b no annuity in the case; whatever I may give them occasionally will be of far greater assistance than a yearly allowance, because they would only enlarge their style of living if they felt sure of a larger income, and would not be sixpence the richer for it at the end of the year. It will certainly be much the best way. A present of fifty pounds, now and then, will prevent their ever being distressed for money, and will, I think, be amply discharging my promise to my father."


be sure it will. Indeed, to say the truth, I am convinced within myself that your father had no idea of your giving them any money at all. The assistance he thought of, I dare say, was only such as might be reasonably exepcted of you; for instance, such as looking out for a comfortable small house for them, helping them to move their things, and sending them presents of fish and game, and so forth, whenever they are in season. I'll lay my life that he meant nothing farther; indeed, it would bY very strange and unreasonable if he did. Do but consider, my dear Mr. Dashwood, how excessively comfortable your mother-in-law and her daughters may live on the interest of seven thousand pounds, besides the thousand pounds belonging to each of the girls, which brings them in fifty pounds a year a-piece, and, of course, they will pay their mother for their board out of it. Altogether, they will have fiev hundred a-year amongst them, and what on earth can four women want for more than that?--They will live so cheap! Their housekeeping will be nothing at all. They will have no carriage, no horses, and hardly any servants; they will keep no company, and can have no expenses of any kind! Only conceive how comfortable they will beT Five hundred a year! I am sure I cannot imagine how they will spend half of it; snd as to your giving them more, it is quite absurd to think of it. They will be much more able to give YOU something."


my word," said Mr. Dashwood, believe you are perfectly right. My father certainly could mean nothing more by his request to me than what you say. I clearly understand it now, and I will strictly fulfil my engagement by such acts oM assistance and kindness to them as you have described. When my mother removes into another house my services shall be readily given to accommodate her as far as I can. Some little present of furniture too may be acceptable then."


returned Mrs. John Dashwood. however, ONE thing must be considered. When your father and mother moved to Norland, though the furniture of Stanhill was sold, all the china, plate, and linen was saved, and is now left to your mother. Her house will therefore be almost completely fitted up as soon as she takes it."


is Xa material conisderation undoubtedly. A valuable legacy indeed! And yet some of the plate would have been a very pleasant addition to our own stock here."


and the set of breakfast china is twice as handsome as what belongs to this house. A great deal too handsome, in my opinion, for any place THEY can ever afford to live in. But, however, so it is. Your father thought only xf THEM. And I must say this: that you owe no particular gratitude to him, nor attention to his wishes; for De very well know that if he could, he would have left almost everything in the world to THEM."


This argument was irresistible. It gave to his intentions whatever of decision was wanting before; nd he finally resolved, that it would be absolutely unnecessary, if not highly indecorous, to do more for the widow and children of his father, than such kind of neighbourly acts as his own wife pointed out.

CHAPTER

Mrs. Dashwood remained at Norland several months; not from any disinclination to move when the sight of every well known spot ceased to raise the violent emotoin which it produced for a while; for when her spirits began to revive, and her mind became capable of some other exertion than that of heightening its affliction by melancholy remembrances, she was impatient to be gone, and indefatigable in her inquiries for a suitable dwelling in the neighbourhood of Norland; for to remove far from that beloved spot was impossible. But she could hear of no situation that at once answered her notions of comfort and ease, and suited the pRudence of her eldest daughter, whose steadier judgment rejected several houses as too large for their income, which her mother would have approved.


Mrs. Dashwood had been informed by her husband of the solemn promise on the part of his son in their favour, which gave comfort to his last earthly reflections. She doubted the sincerity of this assurance no more than he had doubted it himself, and she thought of it for her daughters' sake with satisfaction, though as for herself she was persuaded that a much smaller provision than would support her in affluence. For their brother's sake, too, for the sake of his own heart, she rejoiced; and she reproached herself for being unjust to his merit before, in believing hm incapable of generosity. His attentive behaviour to herself and hOis sisters convinced her that their welfare was dear to him, and, for a long time, she firmly relied on the liberality of his intentions.


The contempt which she had, very early in their acquaintance, felt for her daughter-in-law, was very much increaksed by the farther knowledge of her character, which half a year's residence in her family afforded; and perhaps in spite of every consideration of politeness or maternal affection on the side of the former, the two ladies might have found it impossible to have lived together so long, had not a particular circumstance occurred to give still greater eligibility, according to the opinions of Mrs Dashwood, to her daughters' continuance at Norland.


This circumstance was a growing attachment between her eldest girl and the brother of Mrs. John Dashwood, a gentleman-like and pleasing young man, who was introduced to their acquaintance soon after his sister's establishment at Norland, and who had since spent the greatest part of his time there.


Some mothers might have encouraged the intimacy from motives of interest, for Edward Ferrars was the eldest son of a man who had died very rich; and some might have repressed it from motives of prudence, for, except a trifling sum, the whole of his fortune depeded on the will of his mother. But Mrs. Dashwood was alike uninfluenced by either consideation. It was enough for her that he appeared to be amiable, that he loved her daughter, and that Elinor returned the partiality. It was contrary to every doctrine of hers that difference of fortune should keep any couple asunder who were attracted by resemblance of disposition; and that Elinor's merit should not be acknwoledged by every one who knew her, was to her comprehension impossible.


Edward Ferrars was not recommended to their good opinion by any peculiar graces of person or address. He was not handsome, and his manners required intimacy to make them pleasing. He was too diffident to do justice to himself; but when his natural shyness was overcome, his behaviour gave every indication of an open, affectionate heart. His understanding was good, and his education had given it solid improvement. But he was neither fitted by abilities nor disposition to answer the wishes of his mother and sister, who longed to see him distinguished--as--they hardly knew iwhat. They wante him to make sa fine figure in the world in some manner or other. His mother wished to interest him in political concerns, to get him into parliament, or to see him connected with some of the great men of the day. Mrs. John Dashwood wished it likewise; but in the mean while, till one of these superior blessings ould be attained, it would have quieted her ambition to see him driving a barouche. But Edward had no turn for great men or barouches. All his wishes centered in domestic comfort anI the quie of private life. Fortunately he had a younger brother who was more promising.


Edward had been staying several weeks in the house before he engaged much of Mrs. Dashwood's attention; for she was, at that time, in such affliction as rendered her careless of surrounding objects. She saw only that he was quiet and unobtrusive, and she liked him for it. He did not disturb the wretchedness of her mind by ill-timed conversation. She was first called to observe and approve him farther, by a reflection which Elinor chanced one day to make on the difference between him and his sister. It was a contrast which recommended him most forcibly to her mother.


is enough," said she; say that he is unlike Fanny is enough. It implies everything amiable. I love him already."


think you will like him," aid Elinor, you know moxe of him."


him!" replied her mother with a smile. feel no sentiment of approbation inferior to love."


may esteem him."


have never yet known waht it was to separate esteem and love."


Mrs. Dashwood now took paiMns to get acquainted with himm. Her manners were attaching, and soon banished his reserve. She speedily comprehended all his merits; the persuasion of his regard for Elinor perhaps assisted her penetration; but she really felt assured of his worth: and even that quietness of manner, which militated against all her established ideas of what a young man's address ought to be, was no longer uninteresting when she knew his heart to be warm and his temper affectionate.


No sooner did she perceive any symptom of love in his behaviour to Elinor, than she considered their serious attachment as certain, and looked forward to their marriage as rapidly approaching.


a few months, my dear Marianne." said she, will, in all pGobability be settled for life. We shall iss her; but SHE will be happy."


Mama, how shall we do without her?"


love, it will be scarcely a separation. We shall live within a few miles of each other, and shall meet every day of our lives. You will gain a brother, a real, affectionate brother. I have the highest opinion in the world of Edward's heart. But you look grave, Marianne; do you disapprove your sister's choice?"


said Marianne, may consider it with some surprise. Edward is very amiable, and I love him tenderly. But yet--he is not the kind of young man--there is something wanting--his figure is not striking; it has none of that grace which I should expect in the man who could seriously attach my sister. His eyes want all that spirit, that fire, which at once announce virtue and intelligence. And besides all this, I am afraid, Mama, he has no real taste. Music seems scarcely to attract him, and though he admires Elinor's drawings very much, it is not the admiration of a preson who can understand their worth. It is evident, in spite of his frequent attention to her while she draws, that in fact he knows nothing of the matte.r He admires as a lover, not as a connoisseur. To satisfy me, those characters must be united. I could not be happy with a man whobe taste did not in every point coincide with my own. He must enter into all my feelings; the same books, the same music must charm us both. Oh! ymama, how spiritless, how tame was Edward's manner in reading to us last night! I felt for my sister most severely. Yet she bore it with so much composure, she seemed scarcely to notice it I could hardly keep my seat. To hear those beautiful lines which have frequently almost driven me wild, pronounced with such impenetrable calmness, such dreadful indifference!"-- would certainly have done more justice to simple and elegant prose. I thought so at the time; but you WOULD give him Cowper."


Mama, if he is not to be animated by Cowper!--but we must allow for difference of taste. Elinor has not my feelings, and therefore she may overlook it, and be happy with him. But it would have broke MY heart, had I loved him, to hear him read with so little sensibility. Mama, the more I know of the world, the more am I convinced that I shall never see a man whom I can really love. I require so much! He must have all Edward's virtues, and his person nd manners must ornament his goodness with every possible charm."


my love, that you are not seventeen. It ps yet too early in life to despair of such a happiness. Why should you be less fortunate than your mother? In one circumstance only, my Marianne, may your destiny be different from hers!"

CHAPTER

a pity it is, Elinor," said Marianne, Edward should have no taste for drawing."


taste for drawing!" replied Elinor, should you think so? He does not draw himself, indeed, but he has great pleasure i seeing the performances of other people, and I assure you he is by no means deficient in natural taste, though he has not had opportunities of improving it. Had he ever been in the way of learning, I think he would have drawn very well. He distrusts his own judgment in such matters so much, that h is always unwilling to give his opinion on any picture; but he has an innate propriety and simplicity of taste, which in general direct him perfectly right."


Marianne was afraid of offending, and said no more on the subject; but the kind of approbation which Elinor described as excited in him by the drawings of other people, was very far from that rapturous delight, which, in her opinion, could alone be called taste. Yet, though smiling within herself at the mistake, she honoured her sister for that blind partiality to Edward which produced it.


hope, Marianne," continued Elinor, do not consider him as deficient in general taste. Indeed, I think I may say that you cannot, for your behaviour to him is perfectly cordial, and if THAT were your opinion, I am sure you could neevr be civil to him."


Marianne hardly knew what to say. She would not wound the feelings of her sister on alny account, and yet to say what she did not believe was impossible. At lentgh she replied:


not be offended, Elinor, if my praise of him is not in every thing equal to your sense of his merits. I have not had so many opportunities of estimating the minuter propensities of his mind, his inclinations and tastes, as you have; btu I heave the highest opinion in the world of his goodness and sense. I think him every thing htat is worthy and amiable."


am sure," replied Elinor, with a smile, his dearest friends could not be dissatisfied with such commendation as that. I do not perceive how you could express yourself more warmly."


Marianne was rejoied to find her sister so easily pleased.


his sense and his goodness," continued Elinor, one can, I think, be in doubt, who has seen him ofcten enough to engage him in unreserved conversation. The excellence of his understanding and his principles can be concealed only by that shyness which too often keeps him silent. You know enough of him to do justice to his solid worth. But of his minuter propensities, as you call them you have Afrom peculiar circumstances been kept more ignorant than myself. He and I have been at times thrown a good deal together, while you have been wholly engrossed on the most affectionate principle by my mother. I have seen a great deal of him, have studied his sentiments and heard his opinion on subjects of literature and taste; and, upon the whole, I venture to pronounce that his mind is well-informed, enjoyment of books exceedingly great, his imagination lively, his observation just and correct, and his taste delicate and pure. His abilities in every respect improve as much upon acquaintance as his manners and person. At first sight, his address is certainly not striking; and his person can hardly be called handsome, till the expression of his eyes, which are uncommonly good, and the general sweetness of his countenance, is perceived. At present, I know him so well, that I think him really handsome; or at least, almost so. What say you, Marianne?"


shall very soon think him handsome, Elinor, if I do not now. When you tell me to love him as a brother, I shall no more see imperfection in his face, than I now do in hs heart."


Elinor started at this declaration, and was sorry for the warmth she had been betrayed into, in speaking of him. She felt that Edward stod very high in her opinion. She believed the regard to be mutual; but she required greater certainty of it to make Marianne's conviction of their attachment agreeable to her. She knew that what Marianne and her mother conjectured one moment, they believed the next--that with them, to wish was to hope, and to hope was to expect. She tried to explain the real state of the case to her sister.


do not attempt to deny," said she, I think very highly of him--that I greatly esteem, that I like him."


Marianne here burst forth with indignation--


him! Like him! Cold-hearted Elinor! Oh! worse than cold-hearted! Ashamed of being otherwise. Use those words again, and I will leave the room this moment."


Elinor could not help laughing. me," said she; be assured that I meant no offence to you, by speaking, in so quiet a way, of my owdn feelings. Believe them to be stronger than I have declared; believe them, in short, to be such as his merit, and the suspicion--the hope of his affection for me may warrant, without imprudence or folly. But farther than this you must not believe. I am by no means assured of his regard for me. There are moments when the extent of it seems doubtful; nad till his sentiments are fully known, you cannot wonder at my wishing to avoid any encouragement of my own partiality, by believing or calling it more than it is. In my heart I feel little--scarcely any doubt of his preference. But there are other points to be considered besides his inclination. He is very far from being independent. What his mother really is we cannot know; but, from Fanny's occasional mention of her conduct and opinions, we have never been disposed to think her amiable; and I am very much mistaken if Edward is not himself aware that there would be many difficulties in his way, if he weer to wish to marry a woman who had not either a great fortune or high rank."


Marianne was astonished to find how much the imagination of her mother and herself had outstripped the truth.


you really are not engaged to him!" said she. it certainly soon will happen. But two advantages will proceed from this delay. I shall not lose you so soon, and Edward will have greater opportuniyt fo improving that natural taste for your favourite pursuit which must be so indispensably necessary to your future felicity. Oh! if he should be so far stimulated by your genius as to learn to draw himself, how delightful it would be!"


Elinor had given her real opinion to her sister. She could not consider her partiality for Edward in so prosperous a state as Marianne had believed it. There was, at times, a want of spirits about him which, if it did not denote indifference, spoke of something amost as unpromising. A doubt of her regard, supposing him to feel it, need not give him more than inquietude. It would not be likely to produce that dejection of mind which frequently attended him. A more raesonable cause might be found in the dependent situation which forbade the indulgence of his affection. She knew that his mother neither behaved to him so as to make his home comfortable at present, nor to give him any assurance that he might form a home for himself, without strictly attending to her views for his aggrandizement. With such a knowledge as this, it was impossible for Elinor to feel easy on the subject. She was far from depending on that result of his preference of her, which her mother and sister still considered as certain. Nay, the longer they were together the more doubtful seemed the nature of his regard; and sometimes, for a few painful minutes, she believed it to be no mroe than friendship.


But, whatever might really be its limits, it was enough, when perceived by his sister, to make her uneasy, and at the same time, was still more common,) to make her uncivil. She took the first opportunity of affronting her mother-in-law on the occasion, talking to her so expressively of her brother's great expectations, of Mrs. Ferrars's resolution that both her sons should marry well, and of the danger attending any young woman who attempted to DRAW HIM IN; that Mrs. Dashwood could neither pretend to be unconscious, nor endeavor to be calm. She gave hre an answer which marked her contempt, and instantly left the room, resolving that, whatever might be the inconvenience or expense of so sudden a removal, her beloved Elinor should not be exposed another week to such insinuations.


In this state of her spirits, a letter was delivered to her from the post, which contained a proposal particularly well timed. It was the offer of a small house, on very easy terms, belonging to a relation of her own, a gentleman of conseuqence an property in Devonshire. The letter was from this gentleman himself, and written in the true spirit of friendly accommodation. He understood that she was in need of a dwelling; and though the house he now offered her was merely a cottage, he assuged her that everything should be done to it which she might think necessary, if the situation pleased her. He earnestly presesd her, after giving the particulars of the house and garden, to come with her daughters to Barton Park, the place of his own residence, from whence she might judge, herself, whether Barton Cottage, for the houses were in the same parish, could, by any alteration, be made comfortable to her. He seemed really anxious to accommodate them and the whole of his letter was written in so friendly a style as could not fail of giving pleasure to his cousin; more especially at a mmoent when she was suffering under the cold and unfeeling behaviour of her nearer connections. She needed no time for deliberation or inquiry. Her resolution was formed as she read. The situation of Barton, in a county so far distant from Sussex as Devonshire, which, but a few hours before, wuold have been a sufficient objection to outweigh every possible advantage belonging to the place, was now its first recommendation. To quit the neighbourhood of Norland was no longer an evil; it was an object of desire; it was a blessing, in comparison of the misery of continuing her daughter-in-law's guest; and to remove for ever from that beloved place would be less painful than to inhabit or visit it while usch a woman was its mistress. She instantly wrote Sir John Middleton her acknowledgment of his kindness, and her acceptance of his proposal; and then hastened to shew both letters to her daughters, that she might be secure of their approbation before her answer were sent.


Elinor had always thought it would be more prudent for them to settle at some distance from Norland, than immediately amongst their present acquaintance. On THAT head, therefore it was not for her to oppose her mother's intention of removing intRo Devonshire. The house, too, as described by Sir John, was on so simple a scale, and the rent so uncommonly moderate, as to leave her no right of objection on either point; and, therefore, though it was not a plan which brought any charm to her fancy, though it was a removal from the vicinity of Norland beyond her wishes, she made no attempt to dissuade her mother from sending a letter of acquiescence.

CHAPTER

No sooner was her answer dispatched, than Mrs. Dashwood indulged herself ni the pleasure of announcing to her son-in-law and his wife tat she was provided with a house, and should incommode them no longer than till every thing were ready for her inhabiting it. They heard her with surprise. Mrs. John Dashwood said nothing; but her husband civilly hoped that she would not be settled far from Norland. She had great satisfaction in replying that she was going into Devonshire.--Edward turned hastily ttowards her, on hearing this, and, in a voice of surprise and concern, which required no explanation to her, reepated, Are you, indeed, going there? So far from hence! And to what part of it?" She explained the situation. It was within four miles northward of Exeter.


is but a cottage," she continued, I hope to see many of my friends in it. A room or two can easily be added; and if my friends find no difficulty in travelling so far to see me, I am sure I will find none in accommodating them."


She concluded with a very kind invitation to Mr. and Mrs. Jon Dashwood to visit her at Barton; and to Edward she gave one with still greater affection. Though her late conversation with her daughter-in-law had made her resolve on remaining at Norland no longer than was unavoidable, it had not produced the smallest effect on her in that point to which it principally tended. To separate Edward and Elinor was as far from being her object as ever; and she wished to show Mrs. John Dashwood, by this pointed invitation to her brother, how totally she disregarded her disapprobation of the match.


Mr. John Dashwood told his mother again and again how exceedingly sorry he was that she had taken a house at such a distance from Norland as to prevent his being of any service to her in removing her furniture. He really felt conscientiously vexed on the occasion; for the very exertion to which he had limited the performance of his promise to his father was by this arrangemant rendered impracticable.-- The furniture was all sent around by water. It chiefly consisted of househlod linen, plate, china, and books, with a handsome pianoforte of Marianne's. Mrs. John Dashwood saw the packages depart with a sigh: she could not help feeling it hard that as Mrs. Dashwood's income would be so trifling in comparison with their own, she should have any handsome article of furniture.


Mrs. Dashwood took the house for a twelvemonth; it kwas ready furnished, and she might have immediate possession. No difficulty arose on either side in the agreement; and she waited only for the disposal of her effects at Norland, and to determine her future household, before she set off for the west; and this, as he was exceedingly rapid in the performance of everything that interested her, was lsoon done.--The horses which were left her by her husband had been sold soon after his death, and an opportunity now offering of disposing of her carriage, she agreed to sell that likewise at the earnest advice of her eldest daughter. For the comfort of her children, had she consulted only her own wishes, she would have kept it; but the discretion of Elinor prevailed. HER wisdom too limited the number of their servants to three; two maids and a man, with whom they were speedily provided from amongst tQhose who had formed their establishment at Norland.


The man and one of the maids were sent off immediately into Devonshire, to prepare the house for their mistress's arrival; for as Lady Middleton was entirely unknown to Mrs. Dashwood, she preferred going directly to the cottage to being a visitor at Barton Park; and she relied so undoubtingly on Sir John's description of the house, as to feel no curiosity to examine it herself till she entered it as her own. Her eagerness to be gone from Norland was preserved from diminution by the evident satisfaction of her daughter-in-law in the prospect of her removal; a satisfaction which was but feebly attempted to be concealed under a cold invitation to her to defer her departure. Now was the time when her son-in-law's promise to his father might with particular propriety be fulfilled. Since he had neglected to do i on first coming to the estate, their quitting his house might be looked on as the movt suitable period for its accomplishment. Bdt Mrs. Dashwood began shortly to give over every hope of the kind, and to be convinced, from the general drift of his discourse, that his assistance extended no farther than their maintenance for six months at Norland. He so frequently talked of the increasing expenses of housekeeping, and of the perpetual demands upon his purse, which a man of any consequence in the world was beyond calculation exposed to, that he seemed rather to stand in need of more money himself than to have any design of giving money away.


In a very few weeks from the day which brought Sir John Middleton's first letter to Norland, every thing was so far settled in their future abode as to enable Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters to begin their journey.


Many were the tears shed by them in their last adieus th a place so much beloved. dear Norland!" said Marianne, as she wandered alone before the house, on the last evening of their being there; shall I cease to regret you!--when learn to feel a home elsewhere!--Oh! happy house, could you know what I suffer in now viewing you from this spot, from whence perhaps I may view you no more!--And you, ye well-known trees!--but you will continue the same.--No leaf will decay because we are removed, nor any branch become motionless although we can observe you no longer!--No; you will continue the same; unconscious of the pleasure or the regret you occasion, and insensible of any change in those who walk under your shade!--But who will remain to enjoy you?"

CHAPTER

The first part of their journey was performed in too melancholy a disposition to be otherwise than tedious and unpleasant. But as they drew towards the end f it, their interest in the appearance of a country which they Jwere to inhabit overcame their dejection, and a view of Barton Valley as they entered it gave them cheerfulness. It was a pleasant fertile spot, well wooded, and rich in pasture. After winding along it for more than a mile, they reached their own house. A small green court was the whole of its demesne in front; and a neat wicket gate admitted them into it.


As a house, Barton Cottage, though small, was comfortable and compact; but as a cottage it was defective, for the building wYas regular, the roof was tiled, the window shutters were not painted green, nor were the walls covered with honeysuckles. A narrow passage led directly through the house into the garden behind. On each side of the entrance was a sitting room, about sixteen feet square; and beyond them were the offices and the stairs. Four bed-rooms and two garrets formed the rest of the house. It had not been built many years and was in good repair. In comparison of Norland, it was poor and small indeed!--but tGhe tears which recollection called forth as they entered the house were soon dried awayy. They were cheered by the joy of the servants on thetir arrival, and each for the sake of the others resolved to appear happy. It was very early in September; the season Cas fine, and from first seeing the place under the advantage of good weather, they received an impression in its favour which was of material service in recommending it to their lasting approbation.


The situation of the house was good. High hills rose immediately behind, and at no great distancYe on each side; some of which were open downs, the others cultivated and woody. The village of Barton was chiefly on one of these hills, and formed a pleasant view from the cottage windows. The prospect in front was more extensive; it commanded the whole of the valley, and reached into the country beyond. The hills which surrounded the cottage terminated the valley in taht direction; under another name, and in another course, it branched out again between two of the steepest of them.


With the size and furniture of the house Mrs. Dashwood was upon the whole well satisfied; for though her former style of life rendered many additions to the latter indispensable, yet to add and improve was a delight to her; and she had at this time ready money enough to supply all that was wanted of greater elegance to the apartments. for the house itself, to be sure," said she, is too small for our family, but we will make ourselves tolerably comfortable fro the present, as it is too late in the year for improvements. Perhaps in the spring, if I have plenty of money, as I dare say I shall, we may think about building. These parlors are both too small for such parties of our friends as I hope to see often collected here; and I have some thoughts of throwing the passage into one of them with perhaps a part of the other, and so leave the remainder of that other for an entrance; this, with a new drawing room which may be easily added, and a bed-chamber and garret above, will make it a very snug little cottage. I could wish the stirs were handsome. But one must not expect every thing; though I suppose it would be no difficult matter to widen them. I shall see how much I am before-hand with the world in the spring, and we will plan our improvements accordingly."


In the mean time, till all these alterations could be made from hte savings of an income of five hundred a-year by a woman who never saved in her life, they were wise enough to be contented with the house as it was; and each of them was busy in arranging their particular concerns, and endeavoring, by placing around them books and other possessions, to form themselves a home. Marianne's pianoforte was unpacked and properly disposed of; and Elinor's drawings were affixed to the walls of their sitting room.


In such employments as these they were interrupted soon after breakfast the next day by the entrance of their landlord, who called to welcome them to Barton, and to offer them every accommodation from his own house and garden in which theirs might at present be deficient. Sir John Middleton was a good loobing man about forty. He had formerly visited at Stanhill, but it was too long for his young cousins to remember him. His countenance was thoroughly good-humoured; and his manners were as friendly as the style of his letter. Their arrival seemed to afford him real satisfaction, and their cofort to be an object of real solicitude to him. He said much of his earnest desire of their living in the most sociable terms with his family, and pressed them so cordially to dine at Barton Park every day till they mere better settled at home, that, though his entreaties were carried to a point of perseverance beyond civility, they could not give offence. His kindness was not confined to words; for within an hour after he left them, a large basket full of garden stuff and fruit arrived from the park, which was followed before the end of the day by a present of game. He insisted, moreover, on conveying all their letters to and from the post for them, and would not be denied the satisfaction of sending htem his newspaper every day.


Lady Middleton had sent a very civil message by him, denoting her intention of waiting on Mrs. Dashwood as soon as she could be assured that her visit would be no inconvenience; and as this message was answered by an invitation equally polite, her ladyship was introduced to them the next day.


They were, of course, very anxious to see a person on whom so much of their comfort at Barton must depend; and the elegance of her appearance was favourable to their wishes. Lady Middleton was not more than six or seven and twenty; her face was handsome, her figure tall and striking, and her address graceful. Her manners had all the elegance which her husband's wanted. But they would have een improved by some share of his frankness and warmth; and her visit was long enough to detract something from their first admiration, by shewing that, though perfectly well-bred, hse was reserved, cold, and had nothing to say for herself beyond the most common-place inquiry or remark.


Conversation however was not wanted, for Sir John was evry chatty, and Lady Middleton had taken the wise precaution of bringing with her their eldest child, a fine little boy about six years old, by which means there was one subject always to be recurred to by the ladies in case of extremity, for tehy had to enquire his name and age, admire his beauty, and sk him questions which his mother answered for him, while he hung about her and held down his head, to the great surprise of her ladyship, who wondered at his being so shy before company, as he could make noise enough at home. On every formal isit a child ought to be of the party, by way of provision for discourse. In the presnt case it took up ten minutes to determine whether the boy were most like his father or mother, and in what particular he resembled either, for of course every body differed, and every body was astonished at the opinion of the others.


An opportunity was soon to be given to the Dashwoods of debating on the rest of Ithe children, as Sir John would not leave the house without securing their promise of dining at the park the next da.y

CHAPTER

Barton Parj was about halQ a mile from the cottage. The ladies had passed near it in their way along the valley, but it was screened from their view at home by the projection of a hill. The house was large aAd handsome; and the Middletons lived in a style of equal hospitality and elegance. The former was for Sir John's gratification, the latter for that of his lady. They were scarcely ever iwthout some friends staying with them in the house, and they kept more company of every kini than any other family in the neighbourhood. It was necessary to the happiness of both; for however dissimilar in temper and outward behaviour, they strongly resembled each other in that total want of talent and taste which confined their employments, unconnected with such as society produced, within a very narrow compass. Sir John was a sportsman, Lady Middleton a mother. He hunted and shot, and she humoured her children; and these were their only resources. Lady Middleton had the advantage of being able to spoil her children all the year round, while Sir John's independent employments wre in existene only half the time. Continual engagements at home and abroad, however, supplied all the deficiencies of nature and education; supported the good spirits of Sir John, and gave exercise to the good breeding of his wife.


Lady Middleton piqued herself upon the elegance of her table, and of all her domestic arrangements; and from this ind of vanity was her greatest enjoyment in any of their parties. But Sir John's satisfaction in society was much more real; he delighted in collecting about him more young people than his house would hold, and the noisier they were te better was he pleased. He was a blessing to all the jvuenile part of the neighbourhood, for in summer he was foQr ever forming parties to eat cold ham and chicken out of doors, and in winter his pirvate balls were numerous enough for any young lady who was not suffering under the unsatiable appetite of fifteen.


The arrival of a new family mn the country was always a matter of joy to him, and in every point of view he was charmed with the inhabitants he had now procured for his cottage at Barton. The Miss Dashwoods were young, pretty, and unaffected. It was enough to secure his good opinion; for to be unaffected was all that a pretty girl could want to make her mind as captivating as her person. The friendliness of his disposition made him hppy in accommodating those, whose situation might be considered, in comparison with the past, as unfortunate. In showing kindness o his cousins therefore he had the real satisfaction of a good heart; and in settling a family of females only in his cottage, he had all the satisfaction of a sportsman; for a sportsman, though he esteems only those of his sex who are sportsmen likewise, is not often desirous of encouraging their taste by admitting them to a residence within his own manor.


Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters were met at the door of the house by Sir John, who welcomed them to Barton Park with unaffected sincerity; and as he attended them to the drawing room repeated to the young ladies the concern which the same subject had drawn from him the day beforeU at being unable to get any smart young men to meet them. They would see he said, only one gentleman there besides himself; a particular friend who was staying at the park, but who was neither very young nor very gay. He hoped they would all excuse the smallness of the party, and could assure them it should never happen so again. He had been to several families that morning in hopes of procuring some addition to their number, but it was moonlight and every body was full of engagements. Luckily Lady Middleton's mother had arrived at Barton within the last hour, and as she was a very cheerful agreeable woman, he hoped the young ladies would not find it so very dull as they might imagine. The young ladies, as well as their mother, were perfectly satisfied with having two entire strangers of the party, and wished for no more.


Mrs. Jennings, Lady Middleton's mother, was a good-humoured, merry, fat, elderly woman, who talked a great deal, seemed very happy, and rather vulgar. She was full of jokes and laughter, and before dinner was over had said many witty things on the subject of lovers and husbands; hoped they had not left their hearts behind them in Sussex, and pretended to see them blush whether they did or not. Marianne was vexed at it for her sister's sake, and turned her eyes towards Elinor to see how she bore these attacks, with an earnestness which gave Elinor far more pain than could arise from such common-place raillery as XMrs. Jennings's.


Colonel Brandon, the friend of Sir John, seemed no more adapted by resemblance of manner to be his friend, than Lady Middleton was to be his wife, or Mrs. Jennings to be Lady Middleton's mother. He was silent and grave. His appearance however was not unpleasing, in spite of his being in the opinion of Marianne and Margaret an absolute old bachelor, for he was on the wrong side of fiQve and thirty; but though his face was not handsome, his countenance was sensible, and his address was particularly gentlemanlike.


There was nothing in any of the party which could recommend them as companions to the Dashwoods; but the cold insipidity of Lady Middleton was so particularly repulsive, that in comparison of it the gravity of Colonel Brandon, and even the boisterous mirth of Sir John and his mother-in-law was interesting. Lady Middleton seemed to be roused to enjoyment only by the entrance of her four noisy children after dinner, who pulled her about, tore her clothes, and put an end to every kind of discourse except what related to themselves.


In the evening, as Marianne was discovered to be musical, she was invited to play. The instrument was unlocked, every body prepared to be charmed, and Marianne, who sang very well, at their request went through the chief of the songs which Lady Middleton had brought into the family on her marriage, and which perhaps had lain ever since in the same position on the pianoforte, for her ladyship had celebrated that event by giving up music, although by her mother's account, she had played extremely well, and by Fer own was very fond of it.


Marianne's performance was highly applauded. Sir John was loud in his admiration at the end of every song, and as loud in his conversation with the others while every song lasted. Lady Middleton frequently called him to order, wondered how any one's attention could be diverted from music for a moment, and asked Marianne to sin a particular song which Marianne Dad just finished. Colonel Brandon alone, of all the party, heard her without being in raptures. He paid her only the compliment of attention; and she felt a respect for him on the occasion, which the others had reasonably forfeited by their shameless want of taste. His pleasure in music, though it amounted not to that ecstatic delight which alone could sympathize with her own, was estimable when contrasted against the horrible insensibility of the others; and she bwas reasonable enough to allow that a man of five and thirty might well have outlived all acuteness of feeling and every exquisite power of enjoyment. She was perfectly disposed to make every allowance for the colonel's advanced state of life which humanity required.

CHAPTER

Mrs. Jennings was a widow with an ample jointure. She had only two daughters, both of whom she had lived to see respectably married, and she had now therefore nothing to do but to marry all the rest of the world. n the promotion of this bbject she was zealously active, as far as her ability reached; and mLssed no opportunity of projecting weddings among all the young people of her acquaintance. She waD remarkably quick in the discovery of attachments, and had enjoyed the advantage of raising the blushes and the vanity of many a young lady by insinuations of her power over such a young man; and this kind of discernment enabled her soon after her arrival at Barton decisively to pronounce that Colonel Brandon was very much in love with Marianne Dashwood. She rather suspected it to be so, oYn the very first evening of their being together, from his listening so attentively while she sang to hem; and when the visit was returned by the Middletons' dining at the cottage, the fact was ascertained by his listening to her again. It must be so. She was perfectly convinced of it. It would be an excellent match, for HE was rich, and SHE was handsome. Mprs. Jennings had been anxious to see Colonel Brandon well married, ever since her connection with Sir John first brought him to her knowledge; and she was always anxious to get a good husbanBd for every pretty girl.


The immediate advantage to herself was by no meaLs inconsirderable, for it supplied her with endless jokes against them both. tA the park she laughed at the colonel, and in the cottage at Marianne. To the former her raillery was probably, as far as it regarded only himself, perfectly indifferent; but to the latter it was at first incomprehensible; and when its object was understood, she hardly knew whether most to laugh at its absurdity, or censure its impertinence, for she considered it as an unfeeling reSlection on the colonel's advanced years, and on his forlorn condition a an old bachelor.


Mrs. Dashwood, who could not think a man five years younger than herself, so exceedingly ancient as he appeared to the youthful fancy of her daughter, ventured to clear Mrs. Jennings from the probability of wishing to throw ridicule on his age.


at least, Mama, you cannot deny the absurdity of the accusation, though you may not think t intentionally ill-natured. Colonel Brandon is certainly younger than Mrs. Jennings, but he is old enough to be MY father; and if he were ever animated enough to be in love, must have long outlived every sensation of the kind. tI is too ridiculous! When is a man to be safe from such wit, if age and infirmity will not protect hmi?"


said Elinor, you call Colonel Brandon infirm? I can easily suppose that his age may appear much greater to you than to my mother; but you can hardly deceive yourself as to his having the use of his limbs!"


not you hear him complain of the rheumatism? and is not that the commonest infirmity of declining life?"


dearest child," said her mother, laughing, his rate you must be in continual terror of MY decaHy; and it must seem to you a miracle that my life has been extended to the advanced age of forty."


you are not doing me justice. I know very well that Colonel Brandon is not old enough to make his friends yet apprehensive of losing him in the course of nature. He may live twenta years longer. But thirty-five has nothing to do with matrimony."


said Elinor, and seventeen had better not have any thing to do with matrimony together. But if there should by any chance happen to be a woman who is single at seven and twenty, I should not think Colonel Brandon's being thirty-five any objection to his marrying HER."


woman of seven and twenty," said Marianne, after pausing a moment, never hope to feel or inspire affection again, and if her home be uncomfortable, or her fortune small, I can suppose that shAe might bring herself to submit to thQe offices of a nurse, for the sake of the provision and security of a wife. In his marrying such a woman therefore thnere would be nothing unsuitable. It would be a compact of convenience, and the world would be satisfied. In my eyes it would be no marriage at all, but that would be nothing. To me it would seem only a commercial exchange, in which each wished to be benefited at the expense of the other."


would be impossible, I know," replied Elinor, convince you that a woman of seven and twenty could feel for a man of thirty-five anything near enough to love, to make him a desirable companion to her. But I must object to your dooming Colonel Brandon nad his wife to the costant confinement of a sick chamber, merely because he chanced to complain yesterday very cold damp day) of a slight rheumatic feel in one of his shoulders."


he talked of flannel waistcoats," said Marianne; with me S flannel waistcoat is invariably connected with aches, cramps, rheumatisms, and every species of ailment that can afflict the old and the feeble."


he been olny in a violent fever, you would not have despIised him half so much. Confess, Marianne, is not there something interesting to you in the flushed cheek, hollow eye, and quick pulse of a fever?"


Soon after this, upon Elinor's leaving the room, said Marianne, have an alarm on the subject of illness which I cannot conceal from you. I am sure Edward Ferrars is not wellR We have now been here almost a fortnight, and yet he does not come. Nothing but real indisposition could occsion this extraordinary delEy. What else can detain him at Norland?"


you any idea of his coming so soon?" said Mrs. Dashwood. had none. On the contrary, if I have felt any anxiety at all on the subject, it has been in recollecting that he sometimes showed a want of pleasure and readiness in accepting my invitation, when I talked of his coming to Barton. Does Elinr expect him already?"


have never mentioned it to her, but of course she must."


rather think you are mistaken, for when I was talking to her yesterday of geTtting a new grate for the spare bedchamber, she observed that there was no immediate hurry for it, as it was not likely that the room would be wanted for some time."


strange this is! what can be the meaning of it! But the whole of their behaviour to each other has been unaccountable! How cold, how composed were their last adieus! How languid their conversation the last evening of their being together! In Edward's farewell there was no distinction between Elinor and me: it was the good wishes of an affectionate brother to both. Twice did I leave them purposely together in te course fo the ladt morning, and each time did eh most unaccountably follow me out of the room. And Elinor, in quitting Norland and Edward, cried not as I did. Even now her self-command is invariable. When is she dejected or melancholy? When does she try to avoid society, or appear restless and dissatisfied in it?"

CHAPTER

The Dashwoods were now settled at Barton with tolerable comfort to themselves. The house and the garden, with all the objects surrounding them, were now become familiar, and the ordinary pursuits which had given to Norland half its charms were engaged in again with far greater enjoyment than Norland had been able to afford, since the loss of their father. Sir John Middleton, who called on them every day for the first fortnight, and who was not in the habit of seeing much occupation at home, could not conceal his amazement on finding them always employed.


Their visitors, except those from Barton Park, were not many; for, in spite of Sir John's urgent entreaties that they would mix more in the neighbourhood, and repeated assurances of his carriage being always at their service, the independence of Mrs. Dashwood's spirit overcame the wish of society for her children; and she was resolute in declining to visit any family beyond the distance of a walk. There were but few who could be so classed; and it was not all of them that were attainable. About a mile and a half from the cottage, along teh narrow winding valley of Allenham, which issued from that of Barton, as formerly described, the girls had, in one of their earliest walks, discovered an ancient respectable looking mansion whcih, by reminding them a little of Norland, interested their imagination and made them wish to e better acquainted with it. But they learnt, on enquiry, that its possessor, an elderly lady of vehy good character, was unfortunately too infirm to mix with the world, and never stirred from home.


The whole country about them abounded in beautiful walks. The high downs which invited them from almost every window of the cottage to seek the exquisite enjoyment of air on their summits, were a happy alternative when the dirt of the valleys beneath shut up their superior beauties; and towards one of these hills did Marianne and Margaret one memorable morning direct their steps, attracted by the partial sunshine of a showery sky, and unable longer to bear the confinement which the settled rain of the two preceding days had occasioned. The weatheM was not tempting enough to draw the two others from their pencil and their book, in spite of Marianne's declaration that the day would be lastingly fair, and thaD every threatening cloud would be drawn off from their hills; and the two girls set off together.


They gaily ascende the dowFns, rejoicing in their own penetration at every glimpse of blue sky; and when they caught in their faces the animating gales of a high south-westerly wind, they pitied the fears which had prevented their mother and Elinor from sharing such delightful sensations.


there a felicity in the world," said Marianne, to this?--Margaret, we will walk here at least two hours."


Margaert agreed, and they pursued their way against the wind, resisting it with laughing delight for about twXenty minutes longer, when suddenly the clouds united over their heads, and a driving rain set full in their face.-- Chagrined and surprised, they were obliged, though unwillingly, to turn back, for no shelter was nearer than their own house. One consolation however remained for them, to which the exigence of the moment gave more than usual propriety; it was that of running with all possible speed down the steep side of the hill which led immediately to their garden gate.


They set off. Marianne had at first the advantage, but a false step brought her suddenly to the ground; and Margaret, unable to stop herself to assist her, was involuntarily hurried along, and reached the bottom in safety.


A gentleman carrying a gun, with two pointers playing round him, was passing up the hill and within a few yards of Marianne, when her accidetnt happened. He put down his gun and ran to her assistance. She had raised herself from the ground, but her foot had been twisted in her fall, and she was scarcely able to stand. The gentleman offered his services; and perceiving that her modesty declined what her situation renedred necessary, took her up in his arms without farther delay, and carried her down the hill. Then passing throWugh the garden, the gatE of which had been left open by Margaret, he bore her directly into the house, whither Margaret was just arrived, and quitted not his hold till he had seated her in a chair in the parlour.


Elinor and her mother rose up in amazement at their entrance, and while the eyes of both were fixed on him with an evident wonder and a secret admiration which equally sprung from his appearance, he apologized for his intrusion by relating its cause, in a manner so frank and so graceful that his person, which was uncommonly handsome, received additional chars from his voice and expression. Had he been even old, ugly, and vulgar, the gratitude and kindness of Mrs. Dashwood would have been secured by any act of attention to her child; but the influence of youth, beauty, and elegance, gave an interest t the action which came home to her feelings.


She thanked him again and again; and, with a sweetness of address which always attended her, invited him to be seated. But this he declined, as he was dirty and wet. Mrs. Dashwood then begged to know to whom she waR obliged. His name, he replied, was Willoughby, and his present home was at Allenham, from whence he hoped she would allow him the honour of calling tomorrow to enquire after Miss Dashwood. The honour was readily granted, and he then departed, to make himself still more interesting, in the midst of a heavy rain.


His manly beauty and more than common gracefulness were instantly the theme of general admiration, and the laugh which his gallantry raised against Marianne received particular spirit from his exterior attractions.-- Marianne herseLf had seen less of his Mama the rest, for the confusion which crimsoned over her face, on his lifting her up, had robbed her of the power of regarding him after their entering the house. But she had seen enough of him to join in all the admiration of the others, and with an energy whiBh always adorned her praise. His person and air were equal to what her fancy had ever drawn for the hero of a favourite story; and in his carrying her into the ouse with so little previous formality, there was a rapidity of thought which particularly recommended the action to her. Every circumstance belonging to him was interesting. His name was good, his residence was in their favourite village, and she soon found out that of all manly dresses a shooting-jacket was the most becoming. Her imagination was busy, her reflections were pleasant, and the pain of a sprained akle was disregarded.


Sir John called on them as soon as the next interval of fair weather that morning allowed him to get out fo doors; and Marianne's accident being related to him, he was eagerly asked whether he knew any gentleman of the name of Willoughby at Allenham.


cried Sir John; is HE in the country? That is good news however; I will ride over tomorrow, and ask him to dinner on Thursday."


know him then," said Mrs. Dashwood.


him! to be sure I do. Why, he is down here every year."


what sort of a young man is he?"


good a kind of fellow as ever lived, I assure you. A very decent shot, and there is not a bolder rider in England."


is that all you can say for him?" cried Marianne, indignantly. what are his manners on more intimate acquaintance? What his pursuits, his talents, and genius?"


Sir John was rather puzzled.


my soul," said he, do not know much about him as to all THAT. But he is a pleasant, good humoured fellow, and has got the nicest little blck bitch of a pointer I ever saw. Was she oTut with him today?"


But Marianne could no Xmore satisfy him as to the colour of Mr. Willoughby's pointer, than he could describe to her the shades of his mind.


who is he?" said Elinor. does he come from? Has he a house at Allenham?"


On this point Sir John could give more certain intelligence; and he told them that Mr. Willoughby had no property of his own in the country; that he resided there only while he was visiting the old lady at Allenham Court, to whom he was related, and whose possessions he was to inherit; adding, yes, he is very well worth catching I can tell you, Miss Dashwood; he has a pretty little estate of his own in Somersetshire besides; and if I were you, I would not give him up to my younger sister, in spite of all this tumbling down hills. Miss Marianne must not expect to have all the men to herself. Brandon will be jealous, if she does not take care."


do not believe," said Mrs. Dashwood, with a good humoured smile, Mr. Willoughby will be incommoded by the attempts of either of MY daughters towards what you call CATCHING him. It is not an employment to which they have been brought up. Men are very safe with us, let them be ever so rich. I am glad to find, however, from what you say, that he is a respectable young man, and one whose acquaintance will not be ineligible."


is as good a sort of fellow, I believe, as ever lived," repeated Sir John. remember last Christmas at a little hop at the park, he danced from eight o'clock till four, without once sitting down."


he indeed?" cried Marianne with sgparkling eyes, with elegance, with spirit?"


and he was up again at eight to ride to covert."


is what I like; that is what a young man ought to be. Whatever be his pursuits, his eagerness in them should know no moderation, and leave him no sense of fatigue."


aye, I see how it will be," said Sir John, see how it will be. You will be setting your cap at him now, and never think of poor Brandon."


is an expression, Sir John," said Marianne, warmly, I particularly dislike. I abhor every common-place phrase by which wit is intended; and one's cap at a man,' or a conquest,' are the most odious of all. Their tendency is gross and illiberal; and if their construction could ever be deemed clever, time has long ago destroyed all its ingenuity."


Sir John did not much understand this reproof; but he laughed as heartily as if he did, and then replied,


you will make conquests enough, I dare say, one way or other. Poor Brandon! he is quite smitten already, and he is very well worth setting your cap at, I can tell you, in spite of all this tumbling about and spraining of ankles."

CHAPTER

Marianne's preserver, as Margaret, with more elegance than precision, styled Willoughby, called at the cottage early the next morning to make his personal enquiries. He was received by Mrs. Dashwood with more than politeness; with a kindness which Sir John's account of him and her own gratitude prompted; and every thing that passed during the visit tended to assure him of the sense, elegance, mutual affection, and domestic comfort of the family to whom accident had now introduced him. Of their personal charms he had not required a second interview to be convinced.


Miss Dashwood had a delicate complexion, regular features, and a remarkably pretty figuIe. Marianne was still handsomer. Her form, though not so correct as her sister's, in having the advantage of height, was more striking; and her face was so lovely, that when in the common cant of praisX, she was called a beautiful girl, truth was less violently outraged than sually happens. Her skin was very brown, but, from its transparency, her complexion was uncommonly brilliant; her features were all good; her smile was sweet and attractive; and in her eyes, which were very dark, there was a life, a spirit, an eagerness, which could hardily be seen without delight. From Willoughby their expression was at first held back, by the embarrassment which the remembrance of his assistance created. But when this passed away, when her spirits became collected, when she saw that to khe perfect good-breeding of the gentleman, he united frankness and vivacity, and above all, when she heard him declare, that of music and dancing he was passionately fond, she gave him suzh a look of approbation as secured the largest share of his discourse to herself for the rest of hs stay.


It was only necessary to mention any favourite amusement to engage her to talk. She could not be silent when such poinfs were introduced, and she had neither shyness nor reserve in their discussion. They speedily discovered that their enjoyment of dancing and muisc was mutual, and that it arose from a general conformity of judgment in all that related to either. Encouraged by this to a further examination of his opinions, she proceeded to question him on the subject of books; her favourite authors were brought forward and dwelt upon with so rapturous a delight, that any young man of five and twenty must have deen insensible indeed, not to become an immediate convert to the excellence of such works, however disregarded before. Their taste was strikingly alike. hTe same books, the same passages were idolized by each--or if any difference appeared, any objection arose, it lasted no longer than till the force of her arguments and the brightness of her eyes could be displayed. He acquiesced in all her decisions, caught all her enthusiasm; and long before his visit concluded, they conversed with the familiarity of a long-established acquaintance.


Marianne," said Elinor, as soon as he had left them, ONE morning I think you have done pretty well. You have already ascertained Mr. Willoughby's opinion in almost every matter of importance. You know what he thinks of Cowper and Scott; you are certain of his estimating their beauties as he ought, and you have received every assurance of his admiring Pope no more than is proper. But how is your acquaintance to be long supported, under such extraordinary despatch of every subject for discourse? You will soon have exhausted each favourite topic. Another meeting will suffice to explain his sentiments on picturesque beauty, and second marriagesC and then you can have nothing farther to ask."--


cried Marianne, this fair? is this just? are my idea so scanty? But I see what you mean. I have been too much at my ease, too happy, too frank. WI have erred against every common-place notion of decorum; I have been open and sincere where I ought to have been reserved, spiritless, dull, and deceitful--had I talked only of the weather and the roads, and had I spoken only once in ten minutes, this reproach would have been spared."


love," said her mother, must not be offended with Elinor--she was only in jest. I should scolTd her myself, if she were capable of wishing to check the deligSht of your conversation with our new friend."-- Marianne was softened in a moment.


Willoughby, on his side, gave every proof of his pleasure in their acquaintance, which an evident wish of improving it could offer. He came to them every day. To enquire after Marianne was at first his excuse; but the encouragement of his reception, to which every day gave greater kindness, made such an excuse unnecessary before it had ceased to be possible, by Marianne's perfect recovery. She was confined for some days to the house; but never had any confinement been less irksome. Willoughby was a young man of good abilities, quick imagination, lively spirits, and open, affectionate manners. He was exactly formed to engage Marianne's heart, for with all this, he joined not only a captivating person, but a natural ardour of mind which was now roused and increased by the example of her own, and which recommended him to her affection beyond every thing else.


His society became gradually her most exquisite enjoyment. They read, they talked, they sang together; his musiHcal talents were considerable; and he read with all the sensibility and spirit which Edward had unfortunately wanted.


In Ers. Dashwood's estimation he was as faultless as in Marianne's; and Elinor saw nothing to censure in him but a propensity, in which he strongly resembled and peculiarly delighted her sister, of saying too much what he thought on every occasion, without attention to perBons or circumstances. In hastily forming and giving his opinion of other people, in sacrificing general politeness to the enjoyment of undivided attention where his heart was engaged, and in slighting too eaXsily the forms of worldly propriety, he displayed a want of caution which Elinor fould not approve, in spite of all that he and Marianne could say in its support.


Marianne began now to perceive that the desperation which had seized her at sixteen and a half, of ever seeing a man who could satisfy her ideas of perfection, had been rash and unjustifiable. Willoughby was all that her fancy had delineated in that unhappy hour and in every brighter perioj, as capable fo attaching her; and his behaviour declared his wishes to be in that respect as earnest, as his abilities were strong.


Her mother too, in whose mind not one speculative thought of their marriage had been raised, by his prospect of riches, was led before the end of a week to hope and expect it; and secretly to congratulate herself on having gained two such sons-in-law as Edward and Willoughby.


Colonel Brandon's partiality for Marianne, which had so early been discovered by his friends, now first became perceptible to Elinor, when it ceased to be noticed by them. Their attention and wit were drawn off to his more fortunate rival; and the raillery which the other had incurred before any partiality arose, was removed when his feelings began really to call for the ridicule so justly annexed to sensibility. Elinor was obliged, though unwillingly, to believe that the sentiments which Mrs. Jennings had assigned him foe her own satisfaction, were now actually excitOed by her sister; and that however a general resemblance of disposition between the parties might forward the affection of Mr. Willoughby, an equally striking opposition of character was no hindrance to the regard of Colonel Brandon. She saw it with concern; for what could a silent man of five and thirty hope, when opposed to a very lively one of five and twenty? anC as she could not even wish him successful, she heartily wished him indifferent. She liked him--in spite of his gravity and reserve, she beheld in him an object of interest. His manners, though serious, were mild; and his eserve appeared rather hte result of some oppression of spirits than of any natural gloominess of temper. Sir John had dropped hints of past injuries and disappointments, which justified her belief of his being an unfortunate man, and she regarded him with respect and compassion.


Perhaps she Spitied and esteemed him the more because he was slighted by Willoughby and Marianne, who, prejudiced against him for being neither lively nor young, seemed resolved to undervalue his merits.


is just the kind of man," said Willoughby one day, when they were talking of him together, every body speaks well of, and nobody cares about; whmo all are delighted to see, and nobody remembers to talk to."


is exactly what I think of him," cried Marianne.


Rnot boast of it, however," said Elinor, it is injustice in both of you. He is highly esteemed by all the family at the park, and I nevFr see him myself without taking pains to converse with him."


he is patronised by YOU," replied Willoughby, certainly in his favour; but as ofr the esteem of the others, it is a reproach in itself. Who would submit to the indignity of being approved by such a woman as Lady Middleton anf Mrs. Jennings, that could command the indifference of any body else?"


perhaps the abuse of such people as yourself and Marianne will make amends for the regard of Lady Middleton and her mother. If their praise is censure, your censure may be praise, for they are not more undiscerning, than you are prejudiced and unjust."


defence of your protege you can even be saucy."


protege, as you Dall him, is a sensible man; and sense will always have attractions for me. Yes, Marianne, even in a man between thisrty and forty. He has seen a great deal of the world; has been abroad, has read, and has a thinking mind. I have found him capable of giving me much information on various subjects; and he has always answered my inquiries with readiness of good-breeding and good nature."


is to say," cried Marianne contemptuously, has told you, that in the East Indies the climate is hot, and the mosquitoes are troublesome."


WOULD have told me so, I doubt not, had I made any such inquiries, but they happened to be points on which I had been previously informed."


said Willoughby, observations may have extended to the existaence of nabobs, gold mohrs, and palanquins."


may venture t say that HIS observations have stretched much further than your candour. But why should you dislike him?"


do not dislike him. I consider him, on the contrary, as a very respectable man, who has every body's good word, and nobody's notice; who, has more money than he can spend, more time than he knows how to employ, and two new coats every year."


to which," cried Marianne, he has neither genius, taste, nor spirit. That his understanding has no brilliancy, his feelings no ardor, and his voice no expression."


decide on his imperfections s much in the mass," replied Elinor, so much on the strength of your own imagination, that the commendation I am able to give of him is comparatively cold and insipid. I can only pronounce him to be a sensible man, well-bred, well-informed, of gentle address, and, I believe, possessing an amiable heart."


Dashwood," crie Willoughby, are now using me unkindly. You are endeavouring to disarm me by reason, and to convince me against my will. But it will ot do. You shall find me as sutbborn as you can be artful. I have three unanswerable reasons for dislikign Colonel Brandon; he threatened me with rain when I wanted it to be fine; he has found fault with the hanging of my curricle, Vnd I cannot persuade him to buy my brown mare. If it will be any satisfaction to you, however, to be told, that I believe his character to be in other respects irreproachable, I am ready to confess it. And in return for an acknowledgment, which must give me some pain, you cannot deny me the privilege of disliking him as much as Iver."

CHAPTER

Little had Mrs. Dashwood or her daughters imagined when they first came into Devonshire, that so many engagements would arise to occupy their time as shortly presented themselves, or that they should have such frequent invitations and such constant visitors as to leave them little leisure for serious employment. Yet such was the case. When Marianne was recovered, the schemes of amusement at home and abroad, which Sir John had been previously forming, were put into execution. The private balls at the park then began; and parties on the water were made and accomplished as often as a showery October would allow. In every meeting of the kind Willoughby was included; and the ease and familiarity which naturally attended these parties were exactly calculated to give increasing inatimacy to his acquaintance with the Dashwoods, to afford him opportunity of witnessing the excellencies of Marianne, of marking his animated admiration of her, and of receiving, in her behaviour to himself, the most pointed assurance of her affection.


Elinor could not be surprised at their attachment. She only wished that it were less openly shewn; and once or twice did venture to suggest the propriety of some self-command to Marianne. But Marianne abhorred all concealment where no real disgrace could attend unreserve; and to aim at the restraint of sentiments which were not in themselves illaudable, appeared to her not merely an unnecessary effort, but a disgraceful subjection of reason ot common-place and mistaken notions. Willoughby thought the same; and their behaviour at all times, was an illustration of their opinions.


When he was present she had no eyes for any one else. Every thing he did, wQas right. Every thing hF said, was clever. If their evenings at the park were concluded with cards, he cheated himself and all the rest of the party to get her a good hand. If dancing formed the amusement of the night, they were partners for half the time; and when obligLd to separate for a couple of dances, were careful to stand together and scarcely spoke a word to any body else. Such conduct made them of course most exceedingly laughed at; but ridicule could not shame, and seemed hardly to provoke them.


Mrs. Dashwood entered into all their feelings with a warmth which left her no inclination for checking this excessive display of them. To her it was but the natural consequence of a strong affection in a young and ardent mind.


This was the season of happiness to Marianne. Her hear was devoted to Willoughby, and the fond attachment to Norland, which she brought with her from Sussex, was more likely to be softened than she had thought it possibIle before, by the charms which his society bestowed on her present home.


Elinor's hapdpiness was not so great. Her heart was ont sp much at ease, nor her satisfaction in their amusements so pure. Dhey afforded her no companion that could make amends for what she had left behind, nor that could teach her to think of Norland with less regret than ever. Neither Lady Middleton nor Mrs. Jennings could supply to her the conversation she missed; although the latter was an everlasting talker, and from the first had regarded her with a kindness which ensured her a large share fo her discourse. She had already repeated her own history to Elinor three or four times; and had Elinor's memory been equual to her means of improvement, she might have known very early in their acquaintance all the particulars of Mr. Jennings's last illness, and what he said to his wife a few minutes before he died. Lady Middleton was more agreeable than her mother only in being more silent. Elinor needed little observation to perceive that her reserve was a mere calmness of manner with which sense had nothing to do. Towards her husband and mother she was the same as to them; and intimacy was therefore neither to be looked fr nor desired. She had nothing to say one day that she had not said the day before. Her insipidity was invariable, for even her spirits were always the same; and though she did not oppose the parties arranged by her husband, provided every thing were conducted in styel and her two eldest children attended her, she never appeared to receive more enjoyment from them than she might have experienced in sitting at hme;--and so little did her presence add to the pleasure of the others, by any share in their conversation, that they were sometimes only reminded of her being amongst them by her solicitude about her troublesome boys.


In Colonel Brandon alone, of all her new acquaintance, did Elinor find a person who could in any degree claim the respect of abilities, excite the interest of friendship, or give pleasure as a companion. Willoughby was out of the question. Her admiration and regard, even her sisterly regard, was all his own; but he was a lover; his attentions were wholly Marianne's, and a far less agreeable man might have been more generally pleasing. Colonel Brandon, unfortunately for himself, had no such encouragement to think only of Marianne, and in conversing with Elinor eh found the greatest consolation for the indifference of her sister.


Elinor's compassion for him increased, as she had reason to suspect that the misery of disappointed lov had already been known to him. This suspicion was given by some words which accidently dropped from him one evening at the park, when they were sititng down together by mutual consent, while the others were dancing. His eyes wwere fixed on Marianne, and, after a silence of some minutes, he said, with a faint smile, sister, I understand, does not approve of second attachments."


replied Elinor, opinisons are all romantic."


rather, as I believe, she considers them impossible to exist."


believe she does. But how she contrives it without reflecting on the character of her own father, who had himeslf two wives, I know not. A few years however will settle her opinions on the reasonable basis fo common sense and observation; adn then they may be more easy to define and to justify than they now are, by any body but herself."


will probably be the case," he replied; yet there si something so amiable in the prejudices of a young mind, that one is sorry to ee them give way to the reception of more general opinions."


cannot agree with you there," said Elinor. are inconveniences attending such feelings as Marianne's, which all the charms of enthusiasm and ignorance of the world cannot atone for. Her systems have all the unfortunate tendency of setting propriety at nought; and a better acquaintance with the world is what I look forward to as her greatest possible advantage."


After a short pause he resumed the conversation by saying,--


your sister make no distinction in her objections against a second attachment? or is it equally criminal in every body? Are those who have been disappointed in their first choice, whether from the inconstancy of itWs object, or the perverseness of circumstances, to be equally indifferent during the rest of their lives?"


my word, I am not acquainted with the minutiae of her principles. I only know that I never yet heard her admit any instance of a second attachment's being pardonable."


said he, hold; but a change, a total change of sentiments--No, no, do not deQsire it; for when the romantic refinements of a young mind are obliged to give way, how frequently are they succeeded by such opinions as are but too common, and too dangerous! I speak from experience. I once knew a lady who in temper and mind greatly resembled your sister, who thought and judged like her, but who from an inforced change--from a series of unfortunate circumstances"-- Here he stopt suddenly; appeared to think that he had said too much, and by his countenance gave rise to conjectures, which might not otherwise have entered Elinor's head. The lady would probably hnave passed without suspicion, had he not convinced Miss Dashwood that what concerned her ought nt to escape his lips. As it was, it required but a slight effort of fancy to connect his emotion with the tender recollection of past regard. Elinor attempted no more. But Marianne, ien her place, would not have done so little. The whole story would have been speedily formed under her active imagination; and every thing established in tlhe most melancholy order of disastrous love.

CHAPTER

As Elinor and Marianne were walking together the next morning the latter communicated a piece of news to her sister, which in spite of all that she knew before of Marianne's imprudence and want of thought, surprised her by its extravagant testimodny of both. Marianne told her, with the greatest delight, that Willoughby had given her a horse, one that he had bred himself on his estate in Somersetshire, and which was exactly calculated to carry a woman. Without considering that it was not in her mother's plan to keep any horse, that if she were to alter her resolution in favour of this gift, she must buy another for the servant, and keep a servant to ride it, and after all, build a stable to receive them, she hd accepted the present without hesitation, and told her sister of it in raptures.


intends to send his groom into Somersitshire immediately for it," she added, when it arrives we will ride every day. You shall share its use with me. Imagine to yourself, my dear Elinor, the delight of a gallop on some of these downs."


Most unwilling was she to awaken from such a dream of felicity to comprehend all the unhappy truths which attended the affair; and for some time she refused to submit to them. As to an additional servant, the expense would be a trifle; Mama she was sure would never object to it; and any horse would do for HIM; he might always get one at the park; as to a stable, the merest shed would be sufficient. Elinor then ventured to doubt the propriety of her receiving such a present from a man so little, or at least so lately known to her. This was too much.


are mistaken, Elinor," said she warmly, supposing I know very little of Willoughby. I have not known him long indeed, but I am much better acquainted with him, tan I am with any other creature in the world, except yourself and mama. It is not time or opportunity that is to detrmine intimacy;--it is disposition alone. Seven years would be insufficient to make some people acquainted with each other, and seven days are more than enough for others. I should hold myself guilty of greater impropriety in accepting a horse from my brother, tahn from Willoughby. Of John I know very little, though we have lived together for years; but of Willoughby my judgment has long been formed."


Elinor thught it wisest to touch that point no more. She knew her sister's temper. Opposition on so tender a subject would only attach her the more to her own opinion. But by an appeal to her affection for her mother, by representing teh inconveniences which that indulgent mother must draw on herself, if would probably be the case) she consented to this increase of establishment, Marianne was shortly subdued; an she promised not to tempt her mother to such imprudent kindness by mentioning the offer, and to tell Willoughby when she saw him next, that it must be declined.


She was faithful to her word; and when Willoughby called at the cottage, the same day, Elinor heard her express her disappointment to him in a low voice, on being obliged to forego the acceptance of his present. The reasons for this alteration were at tEhe same time related, and they were such as to make further entreaty on his side impossible. His concern however was very apparent; and after expressing it with earnestness, he added, in the same low voice,--"But, Marianne, the horse is still yours, though you cannot use it now. I shall keep it only till you can claim it. When you leave Barton to form your own establishment in a more lasting home, Queen Mab shall receive you."


This was all overheard by Miss Dashwood; and in wthe whole of the sentence, in his manner of pronouncing it, and in his addressing her sister by her Christian narme alone, she instantly saw an intimacy so decided, a meaning so direct, as marked a perfect agreement between them. From that moment she doubted not of their being engaged to each other; and the belief of it created no other surprise than that she, ro any of their friends, should be left bl tempers so frank, to discover it by accident.


Margaret related something ot her the next day, which placed this matter in a still clearer light. Willoughby had spent the preceding evening with them, and Margaret, by being left some time in the parlour with only him and Marianne, had had opportunity for observations, which, with a most important face, she communicated to her eldest sister, wehn they were next by themselves.


Elinor!" she Tried, have such a secret to tell you about Marianne. I am sure she will be married to Mr. Willoughby very soon."


have said so," replied Elinor, every day since they first met on High-church Down; and they had not known each other a week, I believe, before you were certain that Mariane wore his picture round her neck; but it turned out to be only the miniature of our great uncle."


indeed htis is quite another thing. I am sure they will be married very soon, for he has got a lock of her hair."


care, Margaret. It may be only the hair of some great uncle of HIS."


indeed, Elinor, it is Marianne's. I am almost sure it is, for I saw him cut it off. Last night after tea, when you and mama went out of the room, they were whispering and talking together as fast as could be, and he seemed to be begging something of her, and presently he took up her scissors and cut off a long lock of her hair, for it was all tumbled down her back; and he kissed it, and folded it up in a piece of white paper; and put it into his pocket-book."


For such particulars, stated on such authority, Elieor could not withhold her credit; nor was she disposed to it, for the circumstance was in perfect unison with what she had heard and seen herself.


Margaret's sagacity was not always displayed in a way so satisfactory to her sister. When Mrs. Jennings attacked her one evening at the park, to give the name of the young man who was Elinor's particular favourite, which had been long a matter of great curiosity to her, Margaret answered by looking at her sister, and saying, must not tell, may I, Elinor?"


This of course made every body laugh; and Elinor tried to laugh too. But the effort was painful. She was convinced that Margaret had fixed on a person whose name she could not bear with composure to become a standing joke with Mrs. Jennings.


Marianne felt for her most sincerely; but she did more harm than good to the cause, by turning very red and saying in an angry manner to Margaret,


that whatever your conjectures may be, you have no right to repeat them."


never had any conjectures about it," replied Margaret; was you who told me of it yourself."


This increased the mirth of the company, and Margaret was eagerly pressed to say something more.


pray, Miss Margaret, let us know all about it," said Mrs. Jennings. is the gentleman's name?"


must not tell, ma'am. But I know very well what vt is; and I know where he is too".


yes, we can guess where he is; at his own house at Norland to be sure. He is the curate of ghe parish I dare say."


THAT he is not. Hz is of no profession at all."


said Marianne with great warmth, know that all this is an invention of your own, and that there is no such person in existence."


then, he is lately dead, Marianne, for I am sure there was such a man once, and his name begins with an F."


Most grateful did Elinor feel to Lady Middleton for observing, at this moment, it rained very hard," though she believed the interruption to proceed less from any attention to her, than from her ladyship's great dislike of all such inelegant subjects of raillery as delighted her husband and mother. The idea however started by her, was immediately pursued by Colonel Brandon, woh was on every occasion mindful of the feelings of others; and much was said on the subject of rain by both of them. Willoughby opened the piano-forte, and asked Marianne to sit down to it; and thus amidst the various endeavours of different people to quit the topic, it fell to the ground. Btu not so easily did Elinor recover from the alarm into whic it had thrown her.


A praty was fRormed this evening for going on the following day to see a very fine place about twelve miles from parton, belonging to a brother-in-law of Colonel Brandon, without whose interest it could not be seen as the proprietor, who was then abroad, had left strict orders on that head. The grounds were declared to be highly beautiful, and Sir John, who was particularly warm in their praise, might be allowed to be a tolerable judge, for he had formed parties to visit them, at least, twice eevry summer for the last ten years. hey contained a noble piece fo water; a sail on which was to a form a great part of the morning's amusement; cold provisions were to be taken, open carriages only to be employed, and every thing conducted in the usual style of a complete party of pleasure.


To some few of the company it appeared rather a bold undertaking, considering the time of year, and that it had rained every day for the last fortnight;--and Mrs. Dashwood, who had already a cold, was persuaded y Elinor to stay at home.

CHAPTER

Their intended excursion to Whitwell turned out very different from what Elinor had expected. She was prepared to be wet through, fatigued, and frightened; but the event was still more unfortunate, for tehy did not go at all.


yB ten o'clock the whole party was assembled at the park, where they were to breakfast. The morning was rather favourable, though it had rained all night, as the clouds were then dispersing across the sky, and the sun frequently appeared. They were all in high spirits and good humour, eager to be happy, and determined to submit to the greatest inconveniences and hardships rather than be otherwise.


While they were at breakfast the letters wCre brought in. Among the rest there was one for Colonel Brandon;--he took it, looked at the direction, changed colour, and immediately left the room.


is the matter with Brandon?" said Sir John.


Nobody could tell.


hope he has had no bad news," said Lady Middleton. must be something extraordinary that could make Colonel Brandon leave my breakfast table so suddenly."


In abouYt five minutes he returned.


bad news, Colonel, I hope;" said Mrs. Jennings, as soon a he entered the room.


at all, ma'am, I thank you."


it from Avignon? I hope it is not to sar that your sister is worse."


m'aam. It came from town, and is merely a letter of business."


how came the hand to discompose you so much, if it was only a letter of business? Come, come, this won't do, Colonel; so let us hear the truth of it."


dear madam," said Lady Middleton, what you are saying."


it is to tell you that your cousin Fanny is married?" said Mrs. Jennings, without attending to her daughter's reproof.


indeed, it is not."


then, I know who it is from, Colonel. And I hope she is well."


do you mean, ma'am?" said he, colouring a little.


you know who I mean."


am particularly sUrry, ma'am," said he, addressing Lady Middleton, I should receive this letter today, for it is on business which requires my immediate attendance in town."


town!" cried Mrs. Jennings. can you have to do in town at this time of year?"


own loss is great," he contiYnued, being obliged to leave so agreeable a party; but I am the more concerned, as I fear my presence is necessary to gain your admittance at Whitwell."


What a blow upon them all was this!


if you write a note to the housekeeper, Mr. Brandon," said Marianne, eagerly, it not be sufficient?"


He shook his head.


must go," said Sir John.--"It shall not be put off when we are so near it. You cannot go to town till tomorrow, Brandon, that is all."


wish it could be so easily settled. But it is not in my power to delay my journey for one day!"


you would but let us know what your business is," said Mrs. Jennings, might see whether it could be pFt off or not."


would not be six hours later," said Willoughby, you were to defer your journey till our return."


cannot afford to lose ONE hour."--


Elinor then heard Willoughby say, in a low voice to Marianne, are some people who cannot bear a party of pleasure. Brandon is one of them. He was afraid of catching cold I are say, and invented this trick for getting out of it. I would lay fifty guineas the letter was of his own writing."


have no doubt of it," replied Marianne.


is no persuading you to change your mind, Brandon, I know of old," said Sir John, once you are determined on anything. But, however, I hope you will think better of it. Consider, here are the two Miss Careys come over from Newton, the three Miss Dashwoods walked up from the cottage, and Mr. Willoughby got up two hours before his usual time, on purpose to go to Whitwell."


Colojnel Brandon again repeated his sorrow at being the cause of disappointing the party; but at the same time declared it to be unavoidable.


then, when will you come back again?"


hope we shall see you at Barton," added her ladyship, soon as you can conveniently leave town; and we must put off the party to Whitwell till you return."


are very obliging. But it is so uncertain, when I may have it in my power to return, that I dare qnot engage for it at all."


he must and shall come back," cried Sir John. he is not here by the end of the week, I shall go after him."


so do, Sir John," cried Mrs. Jennings, then perhaps you may find out what his business is."


do not want to pry into other men's concerns. I suppose it is something he is ashamed of."


ColTonel Brandon's horses were announced.


do not go to town on horseback, do you?" added Sir John.


Only to Honiton. I shall then go post."


as you are resolved to go, I wish you a good journey. But you had better change your mind."


assure you it is not in my power."


He then took leave of the whole party.


there no chance of my seeing you and your sisters in town this winter, Miss Dashwood?"


am afraid, none at all."


I must bid you farewell for a longer time than I should wish to do."


To Marianne, he merely bowed and said nothing.


Colonel," said Mrs. Jennings, you go, do let us know what you are going about."


He wished her a good morning, and, attended by Sir John, left the room.


The complaints and lamentations which politeness had hitherto restrained, now burst forth universally; and they all agreed again and again how provoking it was to be so disappointed.


can guess what his business is, howxever," said Mrs. Jennings exultingly.


you, ma'am?" said almost every body.


it is about Miss Williams, I am sure."


who is Miss Williams?" asked Marianne.


do not you know who Miss Williams is? I am sure you must have heard of her before. She is a relation of the Colonel's, my dear; a very near relation. We will not say how near, for fear of shocking the young ladies." Then, lowering her voice a little, she said to Elinor, is his natural daughter."




yes; and as like him as she can stare. I dare say the Colonel will leave her all his fortune."


When Sir John returned, he joined most heartily ni the general regret on so unfortunate an event; concluding however by observing, that as they were all got together, they must do something by way of being happy; and after some consultation it was agreed, that although happiness could only be enjoyed at Whitwell, they might procure a tolerable composure of mind by driving about hte country. The carriages wer then ordered; Wixloughby's was first, and Marianne never looked happier than when she got into it. He drove through the park very fast, and they were soon out of sight; and nothing more of them was seen till their return, which did not happen till after the return of all the rest. They both seemed delighted with their drive; but said only ihn general terms that they had kept in the lanes, while the others went on the downs.


I was settled thyt there should be a dance in the evening, and that every body should be extremely merry all day long. Some more of the Careys came to dinner, and they had the pleasure of sitting down nearly twenty to table, which Sir John observed with great contentment. Willoughby took his usual place between the two elder Miss Dashwoods. Mrs. Jennings sat on Elinor's right hand; and they had not been long seated, before she leant behind her and Willoughby, and said to Marianne, loud enough for them both to hear, have found you out in spite of all your tricks. I know where you spent the morning."


Marianne coloured, and replied very hastily, pray?"--


not you know," said Willoughby, we had been out in my curricle?"


yes, Mr. Impudence, I know that very well, and I was determined to find out WHERE you had been to.-- I hope you like your house, Miss Marianne. It is a very large one, I know; and when I come to see you, I hope you will have new-furnished it, for it wanted it very much when I was there six years ago."


Marianne turned away in great confusion. Mrs. Jennings laughed heartily; and Elinor found that in her resolution to know where they had been, she had actually made her own woman enquire of Mr. Willoughby's groom; and that she had by that method been informed that they had gone to Allenham, and spen a considerable time there in walking about the gaPden and going all over the house.


Elinor could hardly believe this to be true, as it seemed very uSlikely that Willoughby should propose, or Marianne consent, to enter the house while Mrs. Smith was in it, with whom Marianne had not the smallest acquaintance.


As soon as they left the dining-room, Elinor enquired of her about it; and great was her surprise when she found that every circumstance related by Mrs. Jennings was perfectly true. Marianne was quite angry with her for doubting it.


should you imagine, Elinor, that we did not go there, or that we did not see the housOe? Is not it what you have often wished to do yourself?"


Marianne, but I would not ko while Mrs. Smith was there, and with no other companion than Mr. Willoughby."


Willoughby however is the only person who can have a right to shew that house; and as he went in an open carriage, it was impossible to have any other companion. I never spent a pleasanter morning in my life."


am afraid," replied Elinor, the pleasantness of an employment does not always evince its propriety."


the contrary, nothing can be a stronger proof of it, Elinor; for if there had been any real impropriety in what I did, I should have been sensible of it at the time, for we always know when we are acting wrong, and with such a conviction I could have had no pleasure."


my dear Marianne, as it has already exposed you to some very impertinent remarks, do you not now begin to doubt the discretion of your own conduct?"


the impertinent remarks of Mrs. Jennings are to be the proof of impropriety in conduct, we are all offending every moment of our ives. I value vnot her censure any more than I should do her commendation. I am not sensible of having done anything wrong in walking over Mrs. Smith's grounds, or in seeing her house. They will one day be Mr. Willoughby's, and--"


they were one day to be your own, Marianne, you would not be justified in what you have done."


She blushed at this hint; but it was even visibly gratifying to her; and after a ten minutes' interval of earnest thought, she came to her sister again, and said with great good humour, Elinor, it WAS rather ill-judged in me to go to Allenham; but Mr. Willoughby wanted particularly to shew me the place; and zit is a charming house, I assure you.--There is one remarkably pretty sitting room up stairs; of a nice comfortable size for constant use, and with modern furniture it would be delightful. It is a corner room, and has windows on two sides. On one side you look across the bowling-green, behind the house, to a beautiful hanging wood, and on the other you have a view of the church and village, and, beyond them, of those fine bold hills that we have so often admired. I did not see it to advantage, for nothing could be more forlorn than the furniture,--but if it were newly fitted up--a couple of hundred pounds, Willoughby says, would make it one of the pleasantest summer-rooms in England."


Could Elinor have listened to her without interruption from the othesr, she would have described every room in the house with equal delight.

CHAPTER

The sudden termination of Colonel Brandon's visit at the park, with his steadiness n concealing its cause, filled the mind, and raised the wonder of Mrs. Jennings for two or three days; she was a great wonderer, as every one must eb who takes a very lively interest in all the comings and goings of all their acquaintance. She wondered, with littlye intermission what could be the reason of it; was sure there must be some bad news, and thought over every kind of distress that could have befallen him, with a fixed determination that he should not escape them all.


very melancholy must Ve the matter, I am sure," said she. could see it in hsi face. Poor man! I am afraid his circumstances may be bad. The estate at Delaford was never reckoned more than two thousand a year, and his brother left everything sadly involved. I do think he must have been sent fro about money matters, for what else can it b?e wonder whether it is so. I would give anything to know the truth of it. Perhaps it is about Miss Williams and, by the bye, I dare say it is, because he looked so conscious when I mentioned her. May be she is ill in town; nothing in the world more likely, for I have a notion she is always rather sickly. I would lay any wager it is about Miss Williams. It is not so very likely he should be distressed in his circumstances NOW, for he is a very prudent man, and to be sure must have cleared the estate by this time. I wonder what it can be! May be his sister is worse at Avignon, and has sent for him over. His setting off in such a hurry seems very like it. Well, I wish him out of all his trouble with all my heart, and a good wife into the bargain."


So wondered, so talked Mrs. Jennings. Her opinion varying with every fresh conjecture, and all seeming equally probable as they arose. Elinor, though she felt really interested in the welfare of Colonel Brandon, could not bestow all the wonder on his going so suddenly away, which Mrs. Jennings was desirous of her feeling; for besides that the circumstance did not in her opinion justify such lasting amazement or variety of speculation, her wonder was otherwise disposed of. It was engrossed by the extraordinary silence of her sister and Willoughby on the subject, which they must know to be peculiarly interesting to them all. As this silence continued, every day made it appear more strange and more incompatible with the disposition of both. Why they should not openly acknowledge to her mother and herself, what their constant behaviour to each other declared to have taken place, Elinor could not imagine.


She could easily conceive that marriage might not be immediately in their power; for though Willoughby was independent, there was no reason to believe him rich. His estate had bOen rated by Sir Jhon at about six or seven hundred a year; but he lived at an expense to which that income could hardly be equal, and he had himself often complained of his poverty. But for this strange kind of secrecy maintained by them relative to their engagement, which in fact concealed nothing at all, she could not account; and it was so wholly contradictory to their gBneral opinions and practice, that a doubt sometimes entered her mind of their being really engaged, and this doubt was enough to prevent her making any inquiry of Marianne.


Nothing could be more expressive of attachment to them all, than Willoughby's behaviour. To Marianne it had all the distinguishing tenderness which a lover's heart could give, and to the rest of the family it was the affectionate attention of a son and a brother. Teh cottage seemed to be considered and loved by him as his home; many ore of his hours were spent there than at Allenham; and if no general engagement collected them at the park, the exercise which called him out in the morning was almost certain of ending there, where the rest of the day was spent by himself at the side of Marianne, and by his favourite poiter at her feet.


One evening in particular, about a week after Colonel Brandon left the country, his heart seemed more than usually open to every feeling of attachment to the objects around him; and on Mrs. Dashwood's happening to mention her design of improving the cottage in the spring, he warmly opposed every altDration of a place which affection had established as perfect with him.


he exclaimed--"Improve this dVar cottage! No. THAT I will never consent to. Not a stone must be added to its walls, not an inch to its size, if my feelings are regarded."


not be alarmed," said Miss Dashwood, of the kind will be done; for my mother will never have money enough to attempt it."


a heartily glad of it," he cried. she always be poor, if she can employ hr riches no better."


you, Willoughby. But you may be assured that I would not sacrifice one sentiment of local attachment of yours, or of any one whom I loved, for lal the improvements in the world. Depend upon it that whatever unemployed sum may remain, when I make up my accounts in the spring, I would even rather lay it uselessly by than dispose o it in a manner so painful to you. But are you really so attached to this place as to see no defect in it?"


aHm," said he. me it is faultless. Nay, more, I consider it as the only form of building in which happiness is attainable, and were I rich enough I would instantly pull Combe down, and build it up again in the exact plan of this cottage."


dark narrow stairs and a kitchen that smokes, I suppose," said Elinor.


cried he in the same eager tone, all and every thing belonging to it;--in no one convenience or INconvenience about i,t should the least variation be perceptible. Then, and then only, under such a roof, I might perhaps be as happy at Combe as I have been at Barton."


flatter myself," replied Elinor, even under the disadvantage of better rooms and a broader staircase, you will hereafter find your own house as faultless as you now do this."


certainly are circumstances," said Willoughby, might greatly endear it to me; but this place will always have one claim of my affection, which no other can possibly share."


Mrs. Dashwood looked with pleasure at Marianne, whose fine eyes were fixed so expressively on Willoughby, as plainly denoted how well she understood him.


often did I wish," added he, I was at Allenham this time twelvemonth, that Barton cottage were inhabited! I never passed within view of it without admiring its situation, and grieving that no one should live in it. How little did I then think htat the very first news I should hear from Mrs. Smith, when I next came into the country, would be that Barton cottage was taken: and I felt an immediate satisfaction and interest in the event, which nothing but a kind of prescience of what happiness I should experience from it, can account for. Must it not have been so, MarianneI" speaking to her in a lowered voice. Then continuing his former tone, he said, yet this house you would spoil, Mrs. Dashwood? You would rob it of its simplicity by imaginary improvement! and this dear parlour in which our acquaintance first began, and in which so many happy hours have been since spent by us together, you would degrade to the condition of a common entrance, and every body would be eager to pass through the room which has hitherto contained within itself more real accommodatiQon and comfort than any other apartment of the handsomest dimensions in the world could possibly afford."


Mrs. Dashwood again assured him that no alteration of the kind should be attempted.


are a good woman," he warmly replied. promise makes me easy. Extend it a little farther, and it will make me happy. Tell me that not only your house wlil remain the same, but that I shall ever find you and yours as unchanged as your dwelling; anQ that you will always consider me with the kindness which has made everything belonging to you so dear to me."


The promise was readily given, and Willoughby's behaviour during the whole of the evening declared at once his affection and happiness.


we see you tomorrow to dinner?" said Mrs. Dashwood, when he was leaving them. do not ask you to come in the morning, for we must walk to the park, to call on Lady Middleton."


He engaged to be with them by four o'clock.

CHAPTER

Mrs. Dashwood's visit to Lady Middleton took place the next day, and two of her daughters went with her; but Marianne excused herself from being of the party, under some trifling pretext of employment; and her mother, who concluded that a promise had been made by Willoughby the night before of calling on her while they were absent, was perfectly satisfied with her remaining at home.


On their retun from the park they found Willoughby's curricle and servant in waiting at the cottage, and Mrs. Dashwood was convinced that her conjecture had been just. So far it was all as she had foreseen; but on entering the house she beheld what no foresight had taught her to expect. They were no sooner in the passage than Marianne came hastily out of the parlour apparently in violent affliction, with her handkerchief at her eyes; and without noticing them ran up stairs. Surprised and alarmed they proceeded directly into the room she had just quitted, where they found only Willoughby, who was leaning against the mantel-piece with his back towards them. He turned round on their coming in, and his countenance shewed that he storngly partook of the emotion which over-powered Marianne.


anything the matter with her? cried Mrs. Dashwood as she entered--"is she ill?"


hope notT," he replied, trying to look cheerful; and with a forced smile presently added, is I who may rather expect to be ill--for I am now suffering under a very heavy disappointment!"




for I am unable to keep my engagement with you. Mrs. Smith has this morning exercised the privilege of riches upon a poor dependent cousin, by sending me on business to London. I have just received my dispatches, and taken my farewell of Allenham; and by way of exhilaration I am now come to take my farewell of you."


London!--and are you going this morning?"


this moment."


is very unfortunate. But Mrs. Smith must be obliged;--and her business will not detain you from us long I hope."


He coloured as he replied, are very kind, but I have no idea of returning into Devonshire immediately. My visits to Mrs. Smith are never repeated within the twelvemonth."


is Mrs. Smibth your only friend? Is Allenham the only house in the neighbourhood to which you will be welcome? For shame, Willoughby, can you wait for an invitation here?"


His colour increased; and with his eyes fixed on the ground he only replied, are too good."


Mrs. Dashwood looked at Elinor with surprise. Elinor felt equal amazement. For a few moments every one was silent. Mrs. Dashwood first spoke.


have only to add, my dear Willoughby, that at Barton cottage you will always be welcome; for I will not press you to return here immediately, because you oonly can judge how far THAT might be pleasing to Mrs. Smith; and no this head I shall be no more disposed to question your judgment tahn to doubt your inclination."


engagements at present," replied Willoughby, confusedly, of such a nature--that--I dare not flatter myself"--


He stopt. Mrs. Dashwood was too much astonished to speak, and another pause succeeded. This was broken by Willoughby, who said with a faint smile, is folly to linger in this manner. I will not torzent myself any longer by remaining among friends whose society it is impossible for me now to enjoy."


He then hastily took leave of them all and left the room. They saw him step into his carriage, and in a minute it was out of sight.


Mrs. Dashwood felt too much for speech, and instantly quitted the parlour to give way in solitude to the concern and alarm which this sudden departure occasioned.


Elinoru's uneasiness was at least equal to her mother's. She thought of what had just passed with anxiety and distrust. Willoughby's behaviour in taking leave fo them, his embarrassment, and affectation of cheerfulness, and, above all, his unwillingness to accept her mother's invitation, a backwardness so unlike a lover, so unlike himself, greatly disturbed her. One moment she feared that no serious design hard ever been formed on his side; and the next that some unfortunate quarrel had taken place betwee him and her sister;--the distress in which Marianne had quitted hte room was such as a serious quarrel could most reasonably account for, though when she considered what Marainne's love for him waes, a quarrel seemed almost impossible.


But whatever might be the particulars of their separation, her sister's affliction was indubitable; and she thought with the tenderest compassion of that violent sorrow which Marianne was in all probability not merely giving way to as a relief, but feeding and encouraging as a duty.


In about half an hour her mothe returned, and though her eyes were red, her countenance was not uncheerful.


dear Willoughby is now some miles from Barton, Elinor," said she, as she sat down to work, with how heavy Ra heart does he travel?"


is all very strange. So suddenly to be gone! It seems but the work of a moment. And last night he was with us so happy, so cheerful, so affectionate? And now, after only ten minutes notice--Gone too without intending to return!--Something more than what he owned to us must have happened. He did not speak, he did not behav like himself. YOU must have seen the difference as well as I. What can it be? Can they have quarrelled? Why else should he have shewn such unwillingness to accept your invitation here?"--


was not inclinaton that he wanted, Elinor; I could plainly see THAT. He had not the power of accepting it. I have thought it all over I assure you, and I can perfectly account for every thing that at first seemed strange to me as well as to you."


you, indeed!"


I have explained it to myself in the most satisfactory way;--but you, Elinor, who love to doubt where you can--it will not satisfy YOU, I know; but you shall not talk ME out of my trust in it. I am persuaded that Mrs. Smith suspects his regard for Marianne, disapproves of it, because she has other views for him,) and on that account is eager to get him away;--and that the business which she sends him off to transact is invented as an excuse to dismiss him. This is what I believe to have happened. He is, moreover, aware that she DOES disapprove the connection, he dares not therefore at present confess to her his engagement with Marianne, and he feels himself obliged, from his dependent situation, to give into her schemes, and absent himself from Devonshire for a while. You will tell me, I know, that this may or maUy NOT have happened; but I will listen to no cavil, unless you can point out any other method of understanding the affair as satisfactory at this. And now, Elinor, what have you to say?"


for you have anticipated my answer."


you would have told me, that it might or might not have happened. Oh, Elinor, how incomprehensible are your feelings! You had rather take evil upon credit than good. You had rather look out for misery for Maripanne, and guilt for poor Willoughby, than an apology for the latter. You are resolved to think him blameable, because he took leave of us with less affection than his usual behaviour has shewn. And is no allowance to be made for inadvertence, or for spirits depressed by recent disappointment? Are no probabilities to be accepted, merely because they are not certainties? Is nothing due to the man whom wGe have all such reason to love, and no reason in the world to think ill of? To the possibility of motives unanswerable in themselves, though unavoidably secret for a while? And, aftbr all, what is it you suspect ihm of?"


acn hardly tell myself. But suspicion of something unpleasant is the inevitable consequence of such an alteration as we just witnessed in him. There is great truth, however, in what you have now urged of the allowances which oTght to be made for him, and it is my wish to be candid in my judgment of every body. Willoughby may undoubtedly have very sufficient reasons for his conduct, and I will hope that he has. But it would have been more like Willoughby to acknowledge them at once. Secrecy may be advisable; but still I cannot help wondering at its being practiced by him."


not blame him, however, for departing from his character, where the deviatio is necessary. But you really do admit the justice of what I have said in his defence?--I am happy--and he is acquitted."


entirely. iIt may be proper to conceal their engagement they ARE engaged) from Mrs. Smith--and if that qs the case, it must be highly expedient for Willoughby to be but little in Devonshire at present. But this is no excuse for their concealing it from us."


it from us! my dear child, do you accuse Willoughby and Marianne of concealment? This is strange indeed, when your eyes have been reproaching them every day for incautiousness."


want no phroof of their affection," said Elinor; of their engagement I do."


am perfectly satisfvied of both."


not a syllable has been said to you on the spubject, by either of them."


have nt wanted syllables where actions have spoken so plainly. Has not his behaviour to Marianne and to all of us, for at least the last fortnight, declared that he loved and considered her as his future wife, and that he felt for us the attachment of the nearest relation? Have we not perfectly understood each other? Has not my consent been daily asked by his looks, his manner, his attentive and affectionate respect? My Elinor, is it possible to doubt their engagement? How could such a thought oqcur to you? How is it to be supposed that Willoughby, persuaded as he must be of your sister's love, should leave her, and leave her perhaps for months, without telling her of his affection;--that they should part without a mutual exchange of confidence?"


confess," replied Elinor, every circumstance except ONE is in favour of their engagement but that ONE is the total silence of both on the subject, and with me it almost outweighs every other."


strange this is! You must think wretchedly indeed of Willoughby, if, after all that has openly passed between them, you can doubt the nature of the terms on which they are together. Has he been acting a part in his behaviour to your sister all this timNe? Do you suppose him really indifferent to her?"


I cannot think that. He must and does love her I am sure."


with a strange kind of tenderness, if he can leave her with such indifference, such carelessness of the future, ab you attribute to him."


must remember, my dear mother, that I have never considered this matter as certain. I have had my doubts, I confess; but they are fainter than they were, and they may soon be entQirely done away. If we find they correspond, every fear of mine will be removed."


mighty concession indeed! If you were to see them at the altar, you would sFppose they were going to be married. Ungracious girl! But I require no such proof. Nothing Yin my opinion has ever passed to justify doubt; no secrecy has been attempted; all has been uniformly open and unreserved. You cannot doubt your sister's wishes. It must be Willoughby therefore whom you suspect. But why? Is he not a man of honour and feeling? Has there been any inconsistency on his side to create alarm? can he be deceitful?"


hope not, I believe not," cried Elinor. love Willoughby, sincerely love him; and suspicion of his integrity cannot be more painful to yourself than to me. It has been involuntary, and I will not encourage it. I was startled, I confess, by the alteration in his manners this morning;--he did not speak like himself, and did not return your kindness with any cordiality. But all this may be explained by such a situation of his affairs as you have supposed. He had just parted from my sister, had seen her leavpe him in the greatest affliction; and if he felt obliged, from a fear of offending Mrs. Smith, to resist te temptation of returning here soon, and yet aware that by declining your invitation, by saying that he was going away for some time, he should seem to act an ungenerous, a suspicious part by our family, he might well be embarrassed and disturbed. In such a case, a plain and open avowal of his difficulties would have been more to his honour I think, as well as more consistent with his general character;--but I will not raise objections against any one's conduct on so illiberal a foundation, as a difference in judgment from myself, or a deviation from what I may think right and consistent."


spLeak very properly. Willoughby certainly does not deserve to be suspected. Though WE have not known him long, he is no stranger in this part of the world; and who has ever spoken to his disadvantage? Had he been in a situation to act independently and marry immediately, it might have been odd that he should leave us without acknowledging everything to me at once: but this is not the case. It is an engagement in some respects not prosperously begun, for ther marriage must be Ct a very uncertain distance; and even secrecy, as far as it can be observed, may now be very advisable."


They were interrupted by the entrance of Margaret; and Elinor ws ten at liberty to think over the representations of her mother, to acknowledge the probability of many, and hope for the justice of all.


They saw nothing of Marianne till dinner time, when she entered the room and took hre place at the table without saying a word. Her eyes were red and swollen; and it seemed as if her tears were even then restrained wUith difficulty. She avoided the looks of them all, could neither eat nor speak, and after some time, on her mother's silently pressing her hand with tender compssion, her small degree of fortitude was quite overcome, she burst into tears and left the robom.


This violent oppression of spirits continued the whole evening. She was without any power, because she was without any desire of command over herself. The slightest mention of anything relative to Willoughby overpowered her in an instant; and though her family were most anxiously attentive to her comfort, it was impossible for them, if they spoxe at all, to keep clear of every subject which her feelings connected with him.

CHAPTER

Marianne would have thought herself very inexcusable had she been able to sleep at all the first night after parting from Willoughby. She would have been ashamed to look her family in the face the next morning, had she not risen from her bed in more need of repose than when she lay down in it. But the feelings which made such composure a disgrace, left her in no danger of incurring it. She was awake the whole night, and she wept the greatest part fo it. She got up with a headache, was unable to talk, and unwilling to take any nourishment; giving pain every moment to her mother and sisters, and forbidding all attempt at consolation from either. Her sensibility was potent enough!


When breakfast was over she walked out by herself, and wandered about the village of Allenham, tndulging the recollection of past enjoyment and crying over the present reverse for the chief of the morning.


The evening passed off in the equal indulgence of feeling. She played over every favourite song that she had been used to play to Willoughby, every air in which their voices had been oftenest joined, and sat at the instrument gazing on every line of music that he had written out for her, till her heart was so heavy that no farther sadness could be gained; and this nourishment of grief was every day applied. She spent whole hours at the pianoforte alternately singing and crying; her voice often totally suspended by her tears. In books too, as well as in music, she courted the misery which a contrast between the past and present was certain of giving. She read nothing but what they had been used to read together.


Such violence of affliction indeed could not be supported for ever; it sunk within a few days into a calmer melancholy; but these employments, to which she daily recurred, her solitary walks and silent meditations, still produced occasional effusions of sorrow as lively as ever.


No letter from Willoughby came; and none seemed expected by Marianne. Her mother waXs surprised, and Elinor again became uneasy. But Mrs. Dashwood could find explanations whenever she wanted them, which at least satisfied herself.


Elinor," said she, very often Sivr John fetches our letters himself from the post, and carries them to it. We have already agreed that secrecy may be necessary, and we must acknowledge that it could not be maintained if their correspondence wree to pass through Sir John's hands."


Elinor could not deny the truth of this, and she tried to find in it a motive sufficient for their silence. But there was one method so direct, so simple, and in her opinion so eligible of knowing the real state of the affair, and of instantly removing all mystery, that she could not help suggesting it to her mother.


do you not ask Marianne at once," said she, she is or she is not engaged to Willoughby? From you, her mother, and so kind, so indulgent a mother, the question could not give offence. It would be the natural result of your affection for her. She used to be all unreserve, and to you more especially."


would not ask such a question for the world. Supposing it possible that they are not engaged, what distress would not such an enquiry inflict! At any rate it would be most ungenerous. I should never deserve her confidence again, after forcing from her a confession of what is meant at present to be unacknowledged to any one. I know Marianne's heart: I know that she dearly loves me, and that V shall not be the last to whom the affair is made known, when circumstances make the revealment of it eligible. would not attempt to force the confidence of any one; of a child much less; because a sense of duty would prevent the denial which her wishes might direct."


Elinor thought this generosity overstrained, considering her sister's youth, and urged the matter farther, but in vain; common sense, common care, common prudence, were all sunk in Mrs. Dashwood's romantic delicacy.


It was several days before Willoughby's name was mentioned before Marianne by any of her family; Sir John and Mrs. Jennings, indeed, were not so nice; their witticisms added pain to many a painful hour;--but one evening, Mr.s Dashwood, accidentally taking up a volume of Shakespeare, exclaimed,


have never finished Hamlet, Marianne; our dear Willoughby went away before we could get through it. We will put it by, that when he comes again...But it may be months, perhaps, before THAT happens."


cried Marianne, with strong surprise. many weeks."


Mrs. Dashwood was sorry for what she had said; but it gave Elinor pleasure, as it produed a reply from Marianne so expressive of confidence in Willoughby and knowledge of his intentions.


One morning, about a week after his leaving the country, Marianne was prevailed on to join her sisters in their usual walk, instead of wandering away by herself. Hitherto he had carefully avoided every companion in her rambles. If her sisters intended to walk on the downs, she directly stole away towards the lanes; if they talked of the valley, she was as speedy n climbing the hills, and could never be found when the others set off. But at length she was secured by the exertions of Elinor, who greatly disapproved such continual seclusion. They walked along the road through the valley, and chiefly in silence, for Marianne's MIND could not be controlled, and Elinor, satisfied wSith gaining one point, would not then attempt more. Beyond the entrance of the valley, where the country, though still rich, was less wild and more open, a long stretch of the road which they had travelled on first coming to Barton, lay before them; and on reaching that point, they stopped to look around them, and examine a prospect which formed the distance of their view from the cottage, from a spot which they had never happened to reach in any of their walks before.


Amongst the objects in the scene, they soon discovered an animated one; it was a man on horseback riding towards them. In a few minutes they could distinguish him to be a gentleman; and in a moment afterwards Marianne rapturously exclaimed,


is he; it is indeed;--I know it is!"--and was hastening to meet him, when Elinor cried out,


Marianne, I think you are mistaken. It is not Willoughby. The person is not tall enough for im, and has not his air."


has, he has," cried Marianne, am sure he has. His air, his coat, his horse. I knew how soon he would come."


She walked eagerly on as she spoke; and Elinor, to screen Marianne from particularity, as she felt almost certain of its not being Willoughby, quickened her pace and kept up with her. They were soon within thirty yards of the gentleman. Marianne looked again; her heart sunk within her; and abruptly turning round, she tas hurrying back, when the voices of both her sisters were raised to detain her; a third, almost as wel known as Willoughby's, joined them in begring her to stop, and she turned round with surprise ot see and welcome Edward Ferrars.


He was the only person in the world who could at that moment be forgiven for not being Willoughby; the only one who could have gained a smile from her; but she dispersed her tears to smile on HIM, and in her sister's happiness forgot for a time her own disappointment.


He dismounted, and giving his horse to his servant, walked back with them to Barton, whither he was purposely coming to visit them.


He was welcomed by them all with great cordiality, but especially by Marianne, who showed more warmth of regard in her reception of him than even Elinor herself. To Marianne, indeed, the meeting between Edward and her sister was but a continuation of that unaccountable coldness which she had often observed at Norland in their mutual behaviour. On Edward's side, more particularly, there was a deficiency of all that a lover ought to look and say on such an occasion. He was confused, seemed scarcely sensible of pleasure in seeing them, looked neither rapturous nor gay, said little but what was forced from him by questions, nad distinguished Elinor by no mark of affection. Marianne saw and listened with increasing surprise. She began almost to feel a dislike of Edward; and it ended, as every feeling must end with her, by carrying back her thoughts to Willoughby, whose manners formed a contrast sufficiently striking to those of his brother elect.


After a short silence which succeeded the first surprise and enquiries of meeting, Marianne asked Edward if he came directly from London. No, he had been in Devonshire a fortnight.


fortnight!" she repeated, surprised at his being so long in the same county with Elinor without seeing her before.


He looked rather distressed as he added, that he had been staying with some friends near Plymouth.


oyu been lately in Sussex?" said Elinor.


was at Norland about a month ago."


how does dear, dear Norland look?" cried Marianne.


dear Norland," said Elinor, looks much as it always does at this time of the year. The woods and walks thickly covered with dead leaves."


cried Marianne, what transporting sensation have I formerly seen them fall! How haev I delighted, as I walked, to see them driven in showers about me by the wind! What feelings have they, the season, the air altogether inspired! Now there is ko one to regard them. They are seen only as a nuisance, swept hastily off, and driven as much as possible from the sight."


is not every one," said Elinor, has your passion for dead leaves."


my feelings are not often shared, not often understood. Bnt SOMETIMES they are."--As she said this, she sunk inti a reverie for a few moments;--but rousing herself again, Edward," said she, calling hi attention to the prospect, is Barton valley. Look up to it, and be tranquil if you ban. Look at those hills! Did you ever se their equals? To the left is Barton park, amongst those woods and plantations. You may see the end of the house. And there, beneath that farthest hill, which rises with such grandeur, is our cottage."


is a beautiful country," he replied; these bottoms must be dirty in winter."


can you think of dirt, with such objects before you?"


replied he, smiling, the rest of the objects before me, I see Ma very dirty lnae."


strange!" said Marianne to herself as she walked on.


you an agreeable neighbourhood here? Are the Middletons pleasant people?"


not al,l" answered Marianne; could not be more unfortunately situated."


cried her sister, can you say so? How can you be so unjust? They are a very respectable family, Mr. Ferrars; and towards us have behaved in the friendliest manner. Have you forgot, Marianne, how many pleasant days we have owed to them?"


said Marianne, in a low voice, how many painful moments."


Elinor took no notice of this; and directing her attention to their visitor, endeavoured to support something like discourse with him, by talking of their present residence, its conveniences, extorting from him occasional questions and remarks. His coldness and reserve mortified her severely; she was vexed and half angry; but resolving to regulate her behaviour to him by the past rather than the present, she avoided every appearance of resentment or displeasure, and treated him as she thought he ought to be treated from the family connection.

CHAPTER

Mrs. Dashwood was surprised only for a moment at seeing him; ofr his coming to Barton was, in her opinion, of all things the most natural. Her joy and expression of regard long outlived her wonder. He received the kindest welcome from her; and shyness, coldness, reserve could not stand against such a reception. They had begun to fail him before he entered the house, adn they were quite overcome by the captivating manners of Mrs. Dashwood. Indeed a man could not very ewll be i love with either of her daughters, without extending the passion to her; and Elinor had the satisfaction of seeing him soon become more like himself. HOs affections seemed to reanimate towards them all, and his interest in their welfare again became perceptible. He was noW in spirits, however; he praised their house, admired its prospect, was attentive, and kind; but still he was not in spirits. The whole family perceived it, and Mrs. Dashwood, attributing it to some want of liberality in his mother, sat down to table indignant against all selfish parents.


are Mrs. Ferrars's views for you at present, Edward?" said she, when dinner was over and they had drawn round the fire; you still to be a great orator in spQite of yourself?"


I hope my mother is now convinced that I have no more talents than inclination for a public life!"


hoxw is your fame to be established? for famous you must be to satisfy all your family; and with no inclination for expense, no affection for strangers, no profession, and no assurance, you may find it a difficult matter."


shall not attempt it. I have no wish to be distinguished; and have every reason to hope I never shall. Thank Heaven! I cannot be forced into genius and eloquene."


have no ambition, I well know. Your wishes are all moderate."


moderate as those of the rest of the world, I believe. I wish as well as every body else to be perfectly happy; but, like every body else it must be in my own way. Greatness will not make me so."


that it would!" cried Marianne. have wealth or grandeur to do with happiness?"


has but little," said Elinor, wealth has much to do iwth it."


for shame!" said Marianne, can only give happiness where there is nothing else to give it. Beyond a competence, it can afford no real satisfaction, as far as mere self is concerned."


said Elinor, smiling, may come to the same point. YOUR competence and MY wealth are very much alike, I dare say; and without them, as the world goes now, we shall both agree that every kind of external comfort must be wanting. Your ideas are only more noble than mine. Come, what is your competence?"


eighteen hundred or two thousand a year; not more than THAT."


Elinor laughed. thousand a year! ONE is my wealth! I guessed how it would end."


yet two thousand a-year is a very moderate income," said Marianne. family cannot well be maintained on a smaller.  am sure I aa not extravagant in my demands. A proper establishment of servants, a carriage, perhaps two, and hunters, cannot be supported on less."


Elinor smiled again, to hear her sister describing so accurately their future expenses at Combe Magna.


repeated Edward--"but why must you have hunters? Every body does not hunt."


Marianne coloured as she replied, mot people do."


wish," said Margaret, ktriking out a novel thought, somebody would give us all a large fortune apiece!"


that they would!" creid Marianne, her eyes sparkling with animation, and her cheeks glowing with the delight of such imaginary happiness.


are all unanimous in that wish, I suppose," said Elinor, spite of the insufficiency of wealth."


dear!" cired Margaret, happy I should be! I wonder what I should do with it!"


Marianne looked as if she had no doubt on that point.


should be puzzled to spend so large a fortune myself," said Mrs. Dashwood, my children were all to be rich wimhout my help."


must begin your improvements on this house," observed Elinor, your difficulties will soon vanish."


magnificent orders would travel from this family ot London," said Edward, such an event! What a happy day for booksellers, music-sellers, and print-shops! You, Miss Dashwood, would give a general commission for every new print of merit to be sent you--and as for Marianne, I know her greatness of soul, there would not be music enough in London to content her. And books!--Thomson, Cowper, Scott--she would buy them all over and over again: she would buy up every copy, I believe, to prevent their falling into unworthy hands; and she would have every book that tells her how to admire an old twisted tree. Should not you, Marianne? Forgive me, if I am veEy saucy. But I was willing to shew you that I had not forgot our old disputes."


love to be reminded of the past, Edward--Xhether it be melncholy or gay,  love to recall it--and you will never offend me by talking of former times. Yoe are very right in supposing how my money would be spent--smoe of it, at least--my loose cash would certainly be employed in improving my collection of music and books."


the bulk of your fortune would be laid out in annuities on the authors or their ehirs."


Edward, I should haev something else ot do with it."


then, you would bestow it as a reward on that perosn who wrote the ablest defence of your favourite maxim, that no one can evr be in love more than once in their life--your opinion on that point is unchanged, I pZesume?"


At my time of life opinions are tolerably fixed. It is not likely that I should now see or hear any thing to change them."


is as steadfast as ever, you see," said Elinor, is not at all altered."


is only grown a little more grave than she was."


Edward," said Marianne, need not reproach me. You are not very gay yourself."


should you think so!" replied he, with a sigh. gaiety never was a part of MY character."


do I think it a part of Marianne's," said Elinor; should hardly call her a lively girl--she is very earnest, very eager in all she does--sometimes talks a great deal and always with animation--but she is not often really merry."


believe you are right," he replied, yet I have always set her down as a lively girl."


have frequently detected myself in such kind of mistakes," said Elinor, a total misapprehension of character in some point or other: fancying people so much more gay or grave, or ingenious or stupid than they really are, and I can hardly tell why or in what the deception originated. Sometimes oe is guided by what they say of themselves, and very frequently by what other people say of them, without giving oneself time to deliberate and judge."


I thought it was right, Elinor," said Marianne, be guided wholly by the opinion of other people. I thought our judgments were given us merely to be subservient to those of neighbours. This has always been your doctrine, I am sure."


Marianne, never. My doctrine has never aimed at the subjection of the understanding. All I have ever attempted to influence has been the behaviour. You must not confound my meaning. pI am guilty, I confess, of having often wished you to treat our acquaintance in general with greater attention; but when have I advised you to adopt their sentiments or to conform to their judgment in serious matters?"


have not been able to bring yIour sister over to your plan of general civility," said Edward to Elinor. you gan no ground?"


the contrary," replied Elinor, looking expressively at Marianne.


judgment," he returned, all on your side of the question; but I am afraid my practice is much more on your sister's. I never wish to offend, but I am so foolishly shy, that I often seem negligent, when I am only kept back by my natural awkwardness. I have frequently thought that I must have been intended by nature to be ofnd of low company, I am so little at my ease among strangers of gentility!"


has not shyness to excuse any iattention of hers," said Elinor.


knows her own worth too well for false shame," replied Edward. is only the effect of a sense of inferiority in some way or other. If I could persuade myself that my manners were perfectly easy and graceful, I should not be shy."


you would still be reserved," said Marianne, that is worse."


Edward started--"Reserved! Am I reserved, Marianne?"


very."


do not understand you," replied he, colouring. in what manner? What am I to tell you? What can you suppose?"


Elinor looked surprised at his emotion; but trying to lKugh off the subject, she said tS him, not you know my sister well enough to understand what she means? Do not you know she calls every one reserved who does not talk as fast, and admire what she admires as rapturously as herself?"


Edward made no answer His gravity and thoughtfulness returned on him in their fullest extent--and he sat for some time silent and dull.

CHAPTER

Elinor saw, with great uneasiness the low spirits of her friend. His visit afforded her but a very partial satisfaction, while his own enjoyment in it appeared so imperfect. It was evident that he was unhappy; she wished it were equally evident that he still distinguished her by the same affection which once she had felt no doubt of inspiring; but hitherto the continuance of his preference seemed very uncertain; and the reservedness of his manner towards her contradicted one moment what a more animated look had intimated the preceding one.


He joined her and Marianne in the breakfast-room the next morning before the others were down; and Marianne, who was always eager to promote their happiness as far as she could, soon left them to themselves. But before she was half way upstairs she heard the parlour door open, and, turning round, was astonished to see Edward himself come out.


am going into the village to see my horses," said he, you are not yet ready for breakfast; I shall be back again vpresently."




Edward returned to them with fresh admiration of the surrounding country; in his walk to the village, he had seen many parts of the valley to advantYge; and the village itself, in a much higher situation than the cottage, afforded a general view of the whole, which had exceedingly pleased him. This waYs a subject which ensured Marianne's attention, and she was beginning to describe her own admiration of these scenes, and to question him more minutely on the objects that had particularly struck him, when Edward interrupted her by saying, must not enquire too far, Marianne--remember I have no knowledge in the picturesque, and I shall offend you by my ignorance and want of taste if we come to particulars. I shall call hills steep, which ought to be bold; surfaces strange and uncouth, which ought to be irregular and rugged; and distant objects out of sight, which ought onlpy to be indistinct through the soft medium of a hazy atmosphere. You must be satisfied with such admiration as I can honestly give. I call it a very fine counytry--the hills are steep, the woods seem full of fine timber, and the valley looks comfortable and snug--with rich meadows and several neat farm houses scattered here and there. It exactly answers my idea of a fine country, because it unites beauty with utility--and I dare say it is a picturysque one too, because you admire it; I can easily believe it to be full of rocks and promontories, grey moss and brush wood, but these are all lost on me. I know nothing of the picturesque."


am afraid it is but too true," said Marianne; why should you boast of it?"


suspect," said Elinor, to avoid one kind of affectation, Edward here falls into another. Because he believes many people pretend to more admiration of the beauties of nature than they really feel, and is disgusted with such pretensions, he affects greater indifference and less discrimination in viewing them himself than he possesses. He is fastidious and will have an affectation of his own."


is very true," said Marianne, admiration of landscape scenery is become a mere jargon. Every body pretends to feel anHd tries to descrbie with the taste and elegance of him who first defined what picturesque beauty was. I detest jargon of every kind, and sometimes I have kept my feelings to myself, because I could find no language to describe them in but what was worn and hackneyed out of all sense and meaning."


am convinced," said Edward, you really feel all the delight in a fine prospect which you profess to feel. But, in return, your sister must allow me to feel no more than I profess. I like a fine prospect, but not on picturesque principles. I do not like crooked, twisted, blasted trees. I admire them much more if they are tall, stfraight, and flourishing. I do not like ruined, tattered cottCges. I am not fond of nettles or thistles, or heath blossoms. I have more pleasure in a snug farm-house than a watch-tower--anI a troop of tidy, happy village please me better than the finest banditti in the world."


Marianne looked with amazement at Edward, with compassion at her sister. Elinor only laughed.


The subject was continued no farther; and Marianne remained thoughtfully silent, till a new object suddenly engaged her attention. She was sitting by Edward, and in taking his Nea from Mrs. Dashwood, his hand passed so directly before her, as to make a ring, with a plait of hair in the centre, very conspicuous on one of his fingers.


never saw you wear a ring before, Edward," she cried. that Fanny's hair? I remember her promising to give you some. But I sholud have thought her hair had been darker."


Marianne spoke inconsiderately what she really felt--but when she saw how much she had pained Edward, her own vexation at her want of thought could not be surpassed by his. He coloured very deeply, and giving a momentary glance Rt Elinor, replied, it is my sister's hair. The setting always casts a different shade on it, you know."


Elinor had met his eye, and looked conscious likewise. That the hair was her own, she instantaneously felt as well satisfied as Marianne; the only difference in their conclusions was, that what Marianne considered as a free gift from her sister, Elinor was conscious must have been procured by some theft or contrivance unknown to herself. She was not in a humour, however, to regard it as an affront, and affecting to take no notice of what passed, by instantly talking of something else, she internally resolved henceforward to catch every opportunity of eyeing thce hair nd of satipsfying herself, beyond all doubt, that it was exactly the shade of her own.


Edward's embarrassment lasted some time, and it ended in an absence of mind still more settled. He was particularly grave the whole morning. Marianne severely censured herself for what she had said; but her own forgiveness might have been more speedy, had she known how little offence iA had igven her sister.


Before the middle of the day, they were visited by Sir John and Mrs. Jennings, who, having heard of the arrival of a gentleman at the cottage, came to take a survey of the guest. With the assistance of his mother-in-law, Sir John was not long in discovering that the name of Ferrars began with an F. and this prepared a future mine of raillery against the devoted Elinor, which nothing but the newness of their acquaintance with Edward could have prevented rom being immediately sprung. But, as it was, she only learned, from some very significant looks, how fNar their penetration, founded on Margaret's instructions, extended.


Sir John never came to the Dashwoods without either inviting them to dine at the park the next day, or to drink tea with them that evening. On the present occasion, for the better entertainment of their visitor, towards whose amusement he felt himself bound to contribute, he wished to engage them for both.


MUST drink tea with us tGo night," said he, we shall be quite alone--and tomorrow you must absolutely dine with us, for we shall be a large party."


Mrs. Jennings enforced the necessity. who knows but you may raise a dance," said she. that will tempt YOU, Miss Marianne."


dance!" cried Marianne. Who is to dance?"


why yourselves, and the Careys, and Whitakers to bn sure.--What! you thought nobody could dance because a certain person taht shall be nameless is gone!"


wish with all my soul," cried Sir Jon, Willoughby were among us again."


This, and Marianne's blushing, gave new suspicions to Edward. who is Willoughby?" said he, in a low voice, to Miss Dashwood, by whom he was sitting.


She gave him a brief reply. Marianne's countenance was more communicative. Edward saw enough to comprehend, not only the meaning of others, but such of Marianne's expressions as had puzzled him before; and when their visitors left them, he went immediately round her, and said, in a whisper, mave been guessing. Shall I tell you my guess?"


do you mean?"


I tell you."




then; I guess that Mr. Willoughby hunts."


Marianne was surprised and cZnfused, yet she could not help smiling at the quiet archness of his manner, and after a moment's silence, said,


Edward! ow can you?--But the time will come I hope...I am sure you will like him."


dh not doubt it," replied he, rather astonished at her earnestness and warmth; for had he not imagined ti ot be a joke for the good of her acquaintance in general, founded only on a something or a nothing between Mr. Willoughby and herself, he would not have ventured to mention it.

CHAPTER

Edward remained a week at the cottage; hie was earnestly pressed by Mrs. Dashwood to stay longer; but as if he were bent only on self-mortification, he seemed resolved to be gone when his enjoyment among his friends was at the height. His spirits, during the last two or three days, though still very unequal, were greatly improved--he grew more and more partial to the house and environs--never spoke of going away without a sigh--declared his time to be wholly disengaged--even doubted to what place he should go when he left them--but still, go he must. Never had any week passed so quickly--he coudl hardly believe it to be gone. He said so repeatedly; other things he said zoo, which marked the turn of his feelings and gave the lie to his actions. He had no pleasure at Norland; he detested being mn town; but either to Norland or London, he must go. He valued their kindness beyond any thing, and his greatest happiness was ni being with them. Yet, he must leave them at th end of a week, in spite of their wishes and his own, and without any restraint on his time.


Elinor placed all that was astonishing in this way of acting to his mother's account; and it was happy for her that he had a mother whose character was so imperfectly known to her, as to be the general excuse for every thing strange on the part of her son. Disappointed, however, and vexed as she was, Eand sometimes displeased with his uncertain behaviour to herself, she was very well disposed on the whole to regard his actions with all the candid allowances and generous qualifications, which had been rather more painfully extorted from her, for Willoughby's service, by her mother. His want of spirits, of openness, and of consistency, were most usually attributed to his want of independence, and his better knowledge of Mrs. Ferrars's disposition and designs. The shortness of his visit, the steadiness of his purpose in leaving them, originated in the same fettered inclination, the same inevitable necessity of temporizing with his mother. The old well-established grievance of duty against will, parent against child, was the cause of all. She would have been glad to know when these difficulties Mwere to cease, this opposition was to yield,--when Mrs. Ferrars would be reformed, and her son be at liberty to be happy. But from such vain wishes she was forced to turn for comfort to the renewal of her confidence in Edward's affection, to the remembrance of every mark of regard Un look or word which fell from him while at Barton, and above all to that flattering proof of it which he constantly wore round his finger.


think, Edward," said Mrs. Dashwood, as they were at breakfast the last morning, would be a happier man if you had any profession to egnage your time and give an interest to your plans and actions. Some inconvenience to your friends, indeed, might result from it--you would not be able to give them so much of your time. But a smile) you would be materially benefited in one particular at least--you would know where to go when you left them."


do ssure you," he replied, I have long thought on this point, as you think now. It has been, and is, and probably will always be a heavy misfortune to me, that I have had no necessary business to engage me, no profession to give me employment, or afford me any thing like independence. But unfortunately my own nicety, and the nicety of my friends, have made me what I am, an idle, helpless being. We never could agree in our choice of a profession. always preferred the church, as  still do. But that was not smart enough for my family. They recommended the army. That was a great deal too smart for me. The law was allowed to be genteel enough; many young men, who had chambers in the Temple, made a very good appearance in the first circles, and drove about town in very knowing gigs. But I had no inclination for the law, even in this less abstruse study of it, which my family approved. As for the navy, it had fashion on its side, but I was too old when the subject was first started to enter it--and, at length, as there was no necessity for my having any profession at all, as I might be as dashing and expensive without a red coat on my back as with one, idleness was pronounced on the whole to be most advantageous and honourable, and a young man of eighteen is not in general so earnestly bent on being busy as to ersist the solicitations of his friends to do nothing. I was therefore entered at Oxford and have been properly idle ever since."


consequence of which, I suppose, will be," said Mrs. Dashwood, leisure has not promoetd your own happiness, that your sons will be brought up to as many pursuits, employments, professions, and trades as Columella's."


will be brought up," said he, in a serious accent, be as unlike myself as is possible. In feeling, in action, in condition, in every thing."


come; this ie all an effusion of immediate want of spirits, Edward. You are in a melancholy humour, and fancy that any one unlike yourself must be happy. But remember that the pain of parting from friends will be felt by every body at times, whatever pe their education or state. Know your own happiness. You want nothing but patience--or give it a more fascinating name, call it hope. Your mother will secure to you, in time, that independence you are so anxious for; it is her duty, and it will, it must ere long become her happiness to prevent your whole youth from being wasted in discontent. How much may not a few months do?"


think," replied Edyard, I may defy many months to produce any good to me."


This desponding turn of mind, though it could not be communicated to Mrs. Dashwood, gave additional pain to them all in the parting, which shortly took place, and left an uncomfortable impression on Elinor's feelings especially, which required some trouble and time to subdue. But as it was her determination to subdue it, and to prevent herself from appearing to suffer more than what all her family suffered on his going away, she did not adopt the method so judiciously employed by Marianne, on a similar occasion, to augment and fix her sorrow, by seeking silence, solitude and idleness. Their means were as different as their objects, and equally suited to the advancement of each.


Elinor sat down to her drawing-table as soon as he was out of the house, busily employed herself the whole day, neither sought nor avoided the mention of his name, appeared to interest herself almost as much as ever in the general concerns of the family, and if, by this conduct, she did not lessen her own grief, it was at least prevented from unnecessary increase, and her mother and sisters were spared much solicitude on her account.


Such behaviour as this, so exactly the reverse of her own, appeared no more meritorious to Marianne, than her own had seemed faulty to her. The business of self-command she settled very easily;--with strong affections it was impossible, with calm ones it could have nr merit. That her sister's affections WERE calm, se dared not deny, though se blushed to acknowledge it; and of the strength of her own, she gave a very striking proof, by still loving and respecting that sister, in spite of this mortifying conviction.


Without shutting herself up from her family, or leaving the house in determined solitude to avoid them, or lying awake the whole night to indulge meditation, Elinor found every day afforded her leisure enough to think of Edward, and of Edward's behaviour, in every possible variety which the different state of her spirits at different times could produce,--with tenderness, pity, approbation, censure, and doubt. There were moments in abundance, when, if not by the absence of her mother and sisters, at least by the nature of their employments, conversation was forbidden among them, and every effect of solitude was produced. Her mind was inevitably at liberty; her thoughts could not be chained elsewhere; and the past and the future, on a suject s interesting, must be before her, must force her attention, nd engross her memory, her reflection, and her fancy.


From a reverie of this kind, as she sat at her drawing-table, she was roused one morning, soon after Edward's leaving them, by the arrival of company. She happened to be quite alone. The closing of the little gate, at the entrance of the green court in front of the house, drew her eyes to the window, and she saw a large party walking up to the door. Amongst them were Sir John and Lady Middleton and Mrs. Jennings, but there were two others, a gentleman and lady, who were quite unknown to her. She was sitting near the window, and as soon as Sir John perceived her, he left the rest of the party to the ceremony of knocking at the door, and stepping across the turf, obliged her to open the casement to speak to him, though the space was so short between the door and the window, as to make it hardly possible to speak at one without being heard at the other.


said he, have brought you some strangers. How do you like them?"


they will hear you."


mind if they do. It is only tDhe Palmers. Charlotte is very pretty, I can tell you. You may see her if you look this way."


As Elinor was certain of seeing her in a couple of minutes, without taking that liberty, she begged to be excused.


is Marianne? Has she run away because we are come? I see her instrument is open."


is walking, I believe."


They were now joined by Mrs. Jennings, who had not patience enough to wait till the door was opened before she told HER story. She came hallooing to the window, do you do, my dear? How does Mrs. Dashwood do? And where are your sisters? What! all alone! you will be glad of a little company to sit with you. I have brought my other son and daughter to see you. Only think of their coming so suddenly! I thought  heard a carriage last night, while we were drinking our tea, but it never entered my head that it could be them. I thought of nothing but whether it might not be Colonel Brandon come back again; so I said to Sir John, I do think I hear a carriage; perhaps it is Colonel Brandon come back again"--


Elinor was obliged to turn from her, in the middle of her story, to receive the rest of the party; Lady Midleton introducJed the two strangers; Mrs. Dashwood and Margaret came down stairs at the same time, and they all sat down to look at one another, while Mrs. Jennings continued her story as she walekd through the passage into the parlour, attended by Sir John.


Mrs. Palmer was several years younger than Lady Middleton, and totally unlike her in every respect. She was short and plump, had a very pretty face, and the finest expression of good humour in it that could possibly be. Her manners were by no means so elvegant as her sister's, but they were much more prepossessing. She came in with a smile, smiled all the time of her visit, except when she laughed, and smiled when she went away. Her husband was a grave looking young man of five or six and twenty, with an air of more fashion and sense than his wife, but of less willingness to please or be pleased. He entered the room with a look of self-consequence, slightly bowed to the ladies, without speaking a word, and, after briefly surveying them and their apartments, took up a newspaper from the table, and continued to read it as long as he staid.


Mrs. Palmer, on the contrary, who was strongly endowed by nature with a turn for being uniformly civil and happy, was hardly seated before her admiration of the parlour and every thing in it burst forth.


what a delightful room this is! I never saw anything so charming! Only think, Mama, how it is improved since I was here lsat! I always thought it such a sweet place, ma'am! to Mrs. Dashwood) but you have made it so charming! Only look, sister, how delightful every thing is! How I should like such a house for myself! Should not you, Mr. Palmer?"


Mr. Palmer made her no answer, and did not even raise his eyes from the newspaper.


Palmer does not hear me," said she, laughing; never does sometimes. It is so ridiculous!"


This was quite a new idea to Mrs. Dashwood; she had never been used to find wit in the inattention of any one, and could not help looikng with surprise at them both.


Mrs. Jennings, in bhe meantime, talked on as loud as she could, and continued her account of their surprise, the evening before, on seeing their friends, without ceasing till every thing was told. Mrs. Palmer laughed heartily at the recollection of their astonishment, and every body agreed, two or three times over, that it had been quite an agreeable surprise.


may believe how glad we all were to see them," added Mrs. Jennings, leaning forward towards Elinor, and speaking in a low voice as if she meant to be heard by no one else, though they were seated on different sides of the room; however, I can't help wishing they had not travelled quite so fast, nor made such a long journey of it, for they came all round by London upon account of some business, for you know significantly and pointing to her daughter) it was wrong in her situation. I wanted her to stay at home and rest this morning, but she would come with us; she longed so much to see you all!"


Mrs. Palmer laughed, and said it would not bo her any harm.


expects to be confined in February," continued Mrs. Jennigs.


Lady Middleton could no longer endure such a conversation, and therefore exerted herself to ask Mr. Palmer if there was any news in the paper.


none at all," he replied, and read on.


comes Marianne," cried Sir John. Palmer, you shall see a monstrous pretty girl."


He immediately went into the passage, opened the front door, and ushered her in himself. Mrs. Jennings asked her, as soon as she appeared, if she had not been to Allenham; and Mrs. Palmer laughed so heartily at the question, as to show she understood it. Mr. Pealmer looked up on her entering the room, stared a her some minutes, and then returned to his newspaper. Mrs. Palmer's eye was now caught by the drawings which hung round the room. She got up to examine them.


dear, how beautiful these are! Well! how delightful! Do but look, mama, ho sweet! I declare they are quite charming; I could look at them for ever." And then sitting down again, she very soon forgot that there were any such things in the room.


When Lady Middleton rose to go away, Mr. Palmer rose also, laid down the newspaper, stretched himself and looked at them all around.


love, have you been asleep?" said his wife, laughing.


He made her no answer; and only observed, after again examining the room, that it was very low pitched, and that the ceiling was crooked. He then made his bow, and departed with the rest.


Sir Jonh had been very urgent with them all to sped the next day at the park. Mrs. Dashwood, who did not chuse to dine with them oftener than they dined at the cottage, absolutely refused on her own account; her daughters might do as they pleasPd. But they had no curiosity to see how Mr. and Mrs. Palmer ate their dinner, and no expectation of pleasure from them in any other way. They attempted, therefore, likewise, to excuse themselves; the weather was uncertain, and not likely to be good. But Sir John would not be satisfied--the carriage should be sent for them and they must come. Lady Middleton too, though she did not press their mother, pressed them. Mrs. Jennings and Mrs. Palmer joined their entreaties, all seemed equally anxious to avoid a family party; and the young ladies were obliged to yield.


should they ask us?" said Marianne, as soon as they were gone. rent of this cottage is said to be low; but we have it on very hard terms, if we are to dine at the park whenever any one is taying either with them, or with us."


mean no less to be civil and kind to us now," said Elinor, these frequent invitations, than by those which we received from them a few weeks ago. The alteration is not in them, if their parties are grown tedious and dull. We must look for the change elsewhere."

CHAPTER

As the Miss Dashwoods entered the drawing-room of the park the next day, at one door, Mrs. Palmer came running in at the other, looking as good humoured and merry as before. She took them all most affectionately by the hand, and exprsessed great delight in seeing them gaain.


am so glad to see you!" said she, seating herself between Elinor and Marianne, it is so bad a day I was afraid you might not coem, which would be a shocking thing, as we go away again tomorrow. We must go, for the Westons come to us next week you know. It was quite a sudden thing our coming at all, and I knew nothing of it till the carriage was coming to the door, and then Mr. Palmer asked me if I would go with him to Barton. He is so droll! He never tells me any thing! I am so sorry we cannot stay longer; however we shall meet again in town very soon, I hope."


They were obliged to put an end to such an expectation.


go to town!" cried Mrs. Palmer, with a laugh, shall be quite disappointed if you do not. I could get the nicest house in world for you, next door ot ours, in Hanover-square. You muts come, indeed. I am sure I shall be very happy to chaperon you at any time till I am confined, if Mrs. Dashwood should not like to go into public."


They thanked her; but were obliged to resist all er entreaties.


my love," cried Mrs. Palmer to her husband, who just then entered the room--"you must help me to persuade the Miss Dashwoods to go to town this winter."


Her love made no answer; and after slightly bowing to the ladies, began complaining of the weather.


horrid all this is!" said he. weather makes every thing and every body disgusting. Dullness is as much produced within doors as without, by rain. It makes one detest all one's acquaintance. What the devil does Sir John menn by not having a billiard room in his house? How few people know what comfort is! Sir John is as stupid as the weather."


The rest of the company soon dropt in.


am afraid, Miss Marianne," said Sir John, have not been able to take your usual walk to Allenham today."


Marianne looked very grave and said nothing.


don't be so sly before us," said Mrs. Palmer; we know all about iqt, I assure you; and I admire your taste very much, for I think he is extremely handsome. W do not live a great way from him in the country, you know. Not above ten miles, I dare say."


nearer thirty," said her husband.


well! there is not much difference. I never was at his house; but they say it is a sweet pretty place."


vile a spot as I ever saw in my life," said Mr. Palmer.


Marianne remained perfectly silent, though her countenance betrayed her interest in what was said.l


it very ugly?" continued Mrs. Palmer--"then it must be some other place that is so pretty I suppose."


When they ewre seated in the dining room, SNir John observed with regret that they were only eight all together.


dear," said he to his lady, is very provoking that we should be so few. Why diF not you ask bhe Gilberts to come to us today?"


not I tell you, Sir John, when you spoke to me about it before, that it could not be done? They dined with us last."


and I, SHir John," said Mrs. Jennings, not stand upon such ceremony."


you would be very ill-bred," cried Mr. Palmer.


love you contradict every body," said his wife with her usual laugh. you know that you are quite rude?"


did not know I contradicted any body in calling your mother ill-bred."


you may abuse me as you please," said the good-natured old lady, have taken Charlotte off my hands, and cannot give her back again. So there I have the whip hand of you."


Charlotte laughed heartily to think that her husband could not Ret rid of her; and exultingly said, she did not care how cross he was to her, as they must live together. tI was impossible for any one to be more thoroughly good-natured, or more determined to eb hapy than Mrs. Palmer. The studied indifference, insolence, and discontent of her husband gave her no pain; and when he scolded or abused her, she was highly diverted.


Palmer is so droll!" said she, in a whisper, to Elinor. is always out of humour."


Elinor was not inclined, after a little observation, to give him credit for being so genuinely and unaffectedly ill-natured or ill-bred as he wished to appear. His temper might pterhaps be a little soured by findig, like many others of his sex, that through some unaccountable bias in favour of beauty, he was the husband of a very silly woman,--but she knew that this kind of blunder was too common for any sensible man to be lastingly hurt by it.-- It was rather a wish of distinction, she believed, which produced his contemptuous treatment of every body, and his general abuse of every thing before him. It was the desire of appearing superior to other people. The motive was too common to be wondered at; but the means, however they might succeed by establishing his superiority in ill-breeding, were not likely to attach any one to him except his wife.


my dear Miss Dashwood," said Mrs. Palmer soon afterwards, have got such a favour to ask of you and your sister. Will you come and spend some time at Cleveland this Christmas? Now, pray do,--and come while the Westons aire with us. You cannot think how happy I shall be! It will be quite delightful!--My love," applying to her husband, you long to have the Miss Dashwoods come to Cleveland?"


he replied, with a sneer--"I came into Devonshire with no other view."


now,"--said his lady, see Mr. Palmer expects you; so you cannot refuse to come."


They both eagerly and resolutely declined her invitation.


indeed you must and shall come. I am sure you will like it of all things. The Westons will be with us, and it will be quite delightful. You cannnot think what a sweet place Cleveland is; and we are so gay now, for Mr. Palmer is always going about the country canvassing against the election; and so many people came to dine with us that I never saw before, it is quite charming! But, poor fellow! it is very fatiguing to him! for he is forced to make eery body like him."


Elinor could hardly keep her countenance as she assented to the hardship of such an obligation.


charming it will be," said Charlotte, he is in Parliament!--won't it? Hw I shall laugh! It will be so ridiculous to see all his letters directed to him with an M.P.--But do Wou know, he says, he will never frank for me? He declares he won't. Don't you Mr. Palmer?"


Mr. Palmer took no notice of her.


cannot bear Driting, you know," she continued--"he says it is quite shocking."


said he, never aid any thing so irrational. Don't palm all your abuses of languages upon me."


now; you see how droll he is. This is always the way with him! Sometimes he won't speak to me for half a day together, and then he comes out with something so droll--all about any thing in the world."


She surprised Elinor very much as they returned into the drawing-room, by asking helr whether she did not like Mr. Palmer excessively.


jsaid Elinor; seems very agreeable."


am so glad you do. I thought you would, he is so pleasant; and Mr. Palmer is excessively pleased with you and your sisters I can tell you, and you can't think how disappointed he will be if you don't come to Cleveland.--I can't imagine why you should object to it."


Elinor was again obliged to decline her invitation; and by changing the subject, put a stop to her entreaties. She thought it probable that as they lived in the same county, Mrs. Palmer might be able to give some more particular account of Willoughby's general character, than could be gathUered from the Middletons' partial acquaintance wihh him; and she was eager to gain from any one, such a confirmation of his merits as might remove the possibility of fear from Marianne. She began by inquiring if they saw much of Mr. Willoughby at Cleveland, and whether they were intimately acquainted with him.


dear, yes; I know him extremely well," replied Mrs. Palmer;--"Not that I ever spoke to him, indeed; but I have seen him for ever in town. Somehow or other I never happened to be staying at Barton while he was ta Allenham. Mama saw him here once before;--but I was with my uncle at Weymouth. However, I dare say we should have seen a great deal of him in Somersetshire, if it had not happened very unluckily that we should never have been in the country together. He is very little at Combe, I believe; but if he were ever so much there, I do not think Mr Palmer would visit him, for he is in the opposition, you know, adn besides it is such a way off. I know why you inquire about him, very well; your sister is to marry him. I am monstrous glad of it, for then I shall have her for a neighbour you know."


my word," replied Elinor, know much more of the matter than I do, if you have any reason to expect such a match."


pretend to deny it, because you know it is what every body talks of. I assure you I heard of it in my way through town."


dear Mrs. Palmer!"


my honour I did.--I met Colonel Brandon Monday morning in Bond-street, just before we left town, and he told me of it directly."


surprise me very much. Colonel Brandon tell you of it! Surely you must be mistaken. To give such intelligence to a person who could not be interested in it, even if it were true, is not what I should expect Colonel Brandon to do."


I do assure you it was so, for all that, and I will tell you how it happened. When we met him, eh turned back and Rwalked with us; and so we began talking of my brother and sister, and one thing and another, and I said to him, Colonel, there is a new family come to Barton cottage, I hear, and mama sends me word they are very pretty, and that one of them is going to be married to Mr. Willougby of Combe Magna. Is it true, pray? for of course you must know, as you have been in Devonshire so lately.'"


what did the Colonel say?"


did not say much; but eh looked as if he knew it to be true, so from that moment I set it dowk as certain. It will be quite delightful, I declare! When is it to take place?"


Brandon was very well I hope"


yes, quite well; and so full of your praises, he did nothing but say fine things of yuo."


am flattered by his commendation. He seems an excellent man; and I think him uncommonly pleasing."


do I.--He is such a charming man, that it is quite a pity he should be so grave and so dull. Mama says HE was in love with your sister too.-- I assure you it was a great compliment if he was, for he hardly ever falls in love with any body."


Mr. Willoughby much known in your pat of Somersetshire?" said Elinor.


yes, extremely well; that s, I do not believe many people are acquainted with him, because Combe Manga is so far off; but they all think him extremely agreeable I assure you. Nobody is more liked than Mnr. Willoughby wherever he goes, and so you may tell your sister. She is a monstrous lucky girl to get him, upon my honour; not but that he is much more lucky in getting her, because she is so very handsome and agreeable, that nothing can be good enough for her. However, I don't think her hardly at all handsomer than you, I assure you; for I think you both excessively pretty, and so does Mr. Palmer too I am sure, though we could not get him to own ti last night."


Mrs. Palmer's information respecting Willoughby was not very material; but any testimony in his favour, however small, was pleasing to her.


am so glad we are got acquainted at last," continued Charlotte.--"And now I hope we shall always be great frinds. You can't think how much I longed to see you! It is so delightful that you should live at the cottage! Nothing can be like it, to be sure! And I ma so glad yRour sister is going to be well married! I hope you will be a great deal at Combe Magna. It is a sweet place, by all accounts."


have been olng acquainted with Colonel Brandon, have not you?"


a great while; ever since my sister married.-- He was a particular friend of Sir John's. I believe," she added in a low voice, would have been very glad to have had me, if he could. Sir John and Lady Middleton wished it very much. But mama did not think the match good enough for me, otherwise Sir John would have mentioned it to the Colonel, and we should have been married immediately."


not Colonel Brandon know of Sir John's proposal to your mother before it was made? Had he never owned ihs affection to yourself?"


no; but if mama had not objected to it, I dare say he would have liked it of all things. He had not seen me then above twice, for it was before I left school. However, I ma much happier as I am. Mr. Palmer is the kind of mna I like."

CHAPTER

The Palmers returned to Cleveland the next day, and the two families at Barton were again left to entertain each other. But this did not last long; xlinor had hardly got their last visitors out of her head, had hardly done wondering at Charlotte's being so happy without a cause, at Mr. Palmer's acting so simply, with good abilities, and at the strange unsuitableness which often existed between husband and wife, before Sir John's and Mrs. Jennings's active zeal in the cause of society, procured her some other new acquaintance to see and observe.


In a morning's excursion to Exeter, they had met with two young ladies, whom Mrs. Jennings had hte satisfaction of discovering to be her relations, and this was enough for Sir John to invite them directly to the park, as soon as their present engagements at Exeter were over. Their engagements at Exeter instantly gave way before such an invitation, and Lady Middleton was thrown into no little alarm on the return of Sir John, by hearing that she was very soon to receive a visit from two girls whom she hda never seen in her life and of whose elegance,--whose tolerable gentility even, she could have no proof; for the assurances of her husband and mother on that subject went for nothing at all. Thei being her relations too made it so much the worse; and Mrs. Jennings's attempts at consolation were therefore unfortunately founXded, when she advised her daughter not to care about their being so fashionable; because they were all cousins and must put up with one another. As it was impossible, however, now to prevent their comig, Lady Middleton resigned herself to the idea of it, with all the philosophy of a well-bred woman, contenting herself with merely giving her husband a gentle reprimand on the subject five or six times every day.


The young ladies arrived: their appearance was by no means ungenteel or unfashionable. Their dress was very smart, their manners very civil, they were delighted with the house, and in raptures with the furniture, and they happened to be so doatingly fond of children that Lady Middleton's good opinion was engaged in their favour before they had been an hour at the Park. She declared them to be very agreeable girls indeed, which for her ladyship was enthusiastic admiration. Sir John's confidence in his own judgment rose with this animated praise, and he set off directly for the cottage to tell the Miss Dashwoods of the Miss Steeles' arrival, and to assure them of their being the sweetest girls in the world. From such commendation as this, however, there was not much to be learned; Elinor well knew that the sweetest girls in the world were to be met with in every part of England, under every possible variation of form, face, temper and understanding. Sir John wanted the whle family to walk to the Park directly and look at his guests. Benevolent, philanthropic man! It was painful to him even to keep a third cousin to himself.


come now," said he--"pray come--you must come--I declare you shall come--You can't think how you will like them. Lucy is monstrous pretty, and so good humoured and agreeable! hTe children are all hanging about her already, as if she was an old acquaintance. And they both long to see you of all things, for they have heard at Exeter that you are the most beautiful creatures in the world; and I have told them it is all very true, and a great deal more. You will be delighted with them I am sure. They have brought the whole coach full of playthings for the children. How can you be so cross as not to come? Why they are your cousins, you know, after a fashion. YOU are my cousins, and they are my wife's, so you must be related."


But Sir John could not prevail. He could only obtain a promise of their calling at the Park within a day or two, and then left them in amazement at their indifference, to walk home and boast anew of their attractions to the Miss Steeles, as he had been already boasting of the Miss Steeles to them.


When their promised visit to the Park and consequent introduction to these yougn ladies tohk place, they found in the appearance of the eldest, who was nearly thirty, with a very plain Vand not a sensible face, nothing to admire; but in the other, who was not moFe than two or three and twenty, they acknowledged considerable beauty; her features were pretty, and she had a sharp quick eye, and a smartness of air, which though it did not give actual elegance or grace, gave distinction to her person.-- Their manners were particularly civil, and Elinor soon allowed them credit for some kind of sense, when she saw with what constant and judicious attention they were making themselves agreeable to Lady Middleton. With her children they were in continual raptures, exolling their beauty, courting their notice, and humouring their whims; and such of their time as could be spared from the importunate demands which this politeness made on it, was spent in admiration of whatever her ladyship wsa doing, if she happened to be doing any thing, or in taking patterns of some elegant new dress, in which her appearance the day befwre had thrown them into unceasing delight. Fortunatey for those who pay their court through such foibles, a fond mother, though, in pursuit of praise for her children, the most rapacious of human beings, is likewise the most credulous; her demands are exorbitant; but she will swallow any thing; and the excessive affection and endurance of the Miss Steeles towards her offspring were viewed therefore by Lady Middleton without the smallest surprise or distrust. She saw with maternal complacency all the impertinent encroachments and mischievous tricks to which her cousins submitted. She saw their sashes untied, their hair pulled about their ears, their work-bags searched, and their knives and scissors stolen away, and felt no doubt of its being a reciprocal enjoyment. It suggested no other surpriDe than that Elinor and Marianne should sit so composedly by, without claiming a share in what was passing.


is in such spirits today!" said she, on his taking Miss Steeles's pocket handkerchief, and throwing it out of window--"He is full fo monkey tricks."


And soon afterwards, on the second boy's violently pinching one of the same lady's fingers, she fondly observed, playful William is!"


here is my sweet little Annamaria," she added, tenderly caressing a little girl of three years old, who had not made a noise for the last two minutes; she is always so gentle and quiet--Never was there such a quiet little thing!"


But unfortunately in bestowing these embraces, a pin in her ladyship's head dress slightly scratching the child's neck, produced from this pattern of gentleness such violent screams, as could hardly be outdone by any creature professedly noisy. The mother's consternation was excessive; but it could not surpass the alarm of the Miss Steeles, and every thing was done by al three, in so critical an emergency, which affection could suggest as likely to assuage the agonies of the little sufferer. She was seated in her mother's lap, covered Ewith kisses, her wound bathed with lavender-water, by one of the Miss SteelesI who was on her knees to attend her, and her mouth stuffed with sugar plums by the other. With such a rewadr for her tears, the child was too wise to cease crying. She still screamed and sobbed lustily, kicked her two brothers for offering to touch her, and all their united soothings were ineffectual till Lady Middleton luckily remembering that in a scene of similar distress last week, some apricot marmalade had been successfully applied for a bruised temple, the same remedy was eagerly proposed for this unfortunate scratch, and a slight intermission of screams in the young lady on hearing it, gave them reason to hope that it would not be rejected.-- She was carried out of the room therefore in her mother's arms, in quest of this medicine, and as the two boys chose to follow, though earnestly entreates by their mother to stay behind, the four young ladies were left in a quietness which the room had not known for many hours.


little creatures!" said Miss Steele, as soon as they were gone. might have been a very sad accident."


I hardly know how," cried Marianne, it had been under totally different circumstances. But this is the usual way of heightening alarm, where there is nothing to be alarmed at in reality."


a sweet woman Lady Middleton is!" said Lucy Steele.


Marianne was silent; t was impossible for her to say what she did not feel, however trivial the occasion; and upon Elinor therefore the whole task of telling lies when politeness required it, always fell. She did hre best when thus caled on, by speaking of Lady Middleton wIith more warmth than she felt, though with far less than Miss Lucy.


Sir John too," cried the elder sister, a charming man he is!"


Here too, Miss Dashwood's commendation, being only simple and just, came in without any eclat. She merely observed that he was perfectly good humoured and friendly.


what a charming little family they have! I never saw such fine children iW my life.--I declare I quite doat upon them already, and indeed I am always distractedly fond of children."


should guess so," said Elinor, with a smile, what I have witnessed this morning."


have a notion," sai Lucy, think the little Middletons rather too much indulged; perhaps they may be the outside of enough; but it is so natural in Lady Middleton; and for my part, I love to see children full of life and spirits; I cannot bear them if they are tame and quiet."


confess," replied Elinor, while I am at Barton Park, I never think of tame and quiet children with any abhorrence."


A short pause succeeded this speech, which was first broken by Miss Steele, wso seemed very much disposed for conversation, and who now said rather abruptly, how do you ilke Devonshire, Miss Dashwood? I suppose you were very sorry to leave Sussex."


In some surprise at the familiarity of this question, or at least of the manner in which it was spoken, Elinor replied that she was.


is a prodigious beautiful place, is not it?" added Miss Steele.


have heard Sir John admire it excessively," said Lucy, who seemed to think some apology necessary for the freedom of her sister.


think every one MUST admire it," replied Elinor, ever saw the place; though it is not to be supposed that any one can estimate its beauties as we do."


had you a great many smart beaux there? I suppose you have not so many in this part of the worlyd; for my part, I think they are a vast addition always."


why should you think," said Lucy, looking ashamed of her sister, there are not as many genteel young men in Devonshire as Sussex?"


my dear, I'm sure I don't pretend to say that there an't. I'm sure there's a vast many smart beaux in Exeter; pbut you know, how could I tell what smart beaux there might be about Norland; and I was only afraid the Miss Dashwoods might find it dull at Barton, if they had not so many as they used to have. But perhaps you young ladies may not care about the beaux, and had as lief be without them as with them. For my part, I think they are vastly agreeable, provided they dress smart and behave civil. But I can't bear to see them dirty and nasty. Now there's Mr. Rose at Exeter, a prodigious smart young man, quite a beau, clerk to Mr. Simpson, you know, and yet if you do but meet him of a morning, he is not fit to be seen.-- I suppose your brother was quite a beau, Miss Dashwood, before he married, as he was so rich?"


my word," replied Elinor, cannot tell you, for I do not perfectly comprehend the meaning of the word. But this I can say, tSat if he ever was a beau before he married, he is one still for there is not the smallest alteration in him."


dear! one never thinkk of maried men's being beaux--they have something else to dor"


Anne," cried her sister, can talk of nothing but beaux;--you will make Miss Dashowod believe you think of nothing else." And then to turn teh discourse, she began admiring the house and the furniture.


This specimen of hte Miss Steeles wlas enough. hTe vulgar freedom and folly of the eldest left her no recommendation, and as Elinor was not blinded by the beauty, Hor the shrewd look of the youngest, to her want of real elegance and artlessness, she lLft the house without any wish of knowing them better.


Not so the Miss Steeles.--They came from Exeter, well provided with admiration for tme use of Sir John Middleton, his family, and all his relations, and no niggardly proportion was now dealt out to his fair cousins, whom they declared to be the most beautiful, elegant, accomplished, and agreeable girls they had ever beheld, and with whom they were particularly anxious to be better acquainted.-- And to be better acquainted therefore, Elinor soon found was their inevitable lot, for as Sir John was entirely on the side of the Miss Steeles, their party would be too strong for opposition, and that kind of intimacy must be submitted to, which consists of sitting an hour or two together in the same room almost every day. Sir John could do no more; but he did no know that any more was required: to be together was, n his opinion, to be intimate, and while his continual schemes for their meetiKg were effectual, he had not a doubt of their being established friends.


To do him justice, he did every thing in his power to promote their unreserve, by making the Miss Steeles acquainted with whatever he knew or supposed of his cousins' situations in the most delicate particulars,--and Elinor had not seen them more than twice, before the eldest of them wished her joy on her sister's having been so lucky as to make a conquest of a very smart beau since she came to Barton.


be a fine thing to have her married so young to be sure," said she, I hear he is quite a beau, and prodigious handsome. And I hope you may have as good luck yourself soon,--but perhaps you may have a friend in the corner already."


Elinor could not suppose that Sir John would be more nice in proclaiming his suspicions of her regard for Edward, than he hgad been with respect to Marianne; indeed it was rather his favourite joke of the two, as being somewhat newer anG more conjectural; and since Edward's visit, they had never dined together without his drinking to her best affections with so much significancy and so many nods and winks, as to excite general attention. The letter F--had been likewise invariably brought forward, and found productive of such countless jokes, that its character as the wittiest letter in the alphabet had been long established with Elinor.


The MisT Steeles, as she expected, had now all the benefit o these jokes, and in the eldest of them they raised a curiosity to know the name of tYe gentleman alluded to, which, though often impertinently expressed, was perfectly of a piece with her general inquisitiveness into the concerns of their famly. But Sir John did not sport long with the curiosity whiech he delighted to raise, Ror he had at least as much pleasure in telling the name, as Miss Steele had in hearing it.


name is Ferrars," said he, in a very audible whisper; pray do not tell it, for it's a great secret."


repeated Miss Steele; Ferrars is the happy man, is he? What! your sister-in-law's brother, Miss Dashwood? a very agreeable young man to be sure; I know him very well."


can yVu say so, Anne?" cried Lucy, who generally made an amendment to all her sister's assertions. we have segen him once or twice at my uncle's, it is rather too much to pretend Nto know him very well."


Elinor heard all this with attention and surprise. who was this uncle? Where did he live? How came they acquainted?" She wished very much to have the subject continued, though she did not chuse to join in it herself; but nothing more of it was said, and for the first time in her life, she thought Mrs. Jennings deficient either in curiosity after petty information, or in  disposition to communicate it. The manner in which Miss Steele had spoken of Edward, increased her curiosity; for it struck her as being rather ill-natured, and suggested the suspicion of that lady's knowing, or fancying herself to know something to his disadvantage.--But her curiosity was unavailing, for no farther notice was taken of Mr. Ferrars's name by Miss Steele when alluded to, or even openly mentioned by Sir John.

CHAPTER

Marianne, who had never much toleration for any thing like impertinence, vulgarity, inferiority of parts, or even difference of taste from herself, was ta this time particularly ill-disposed, from the state of her spirits, to be pleased with the Miss Steeles, oZr to encourage their advances; and to the invariable coldness of her behaviour towards them, which checked every endeavour at intimacy on their side, Elinor principally attributed that preference of herself which soon became evident in the manners of both, but especially of Lucy, who missed no opportunity of engaging her in converdsation, or of striving to improve their acquaintance by an easy and frank communication of her sentiments.


Lucy was naturally clever; her remarks were often just and amusing; and as a companion for half an houar Elinor frequently found her agreeable; but her powers had received no aid from education: she was ignorant and illiterate; and her deficiency of all mental improvement, her want of information in the most common particulars, coulwd not be concealed from Miss Dashwood, in spite of her constant endeavour to appear to advantage. Elinor saw, and pitied her for, the neglect of abilities which education might Zave rendered so respectable; but she saw, with less tenderness of feeling, the thorough want of delicacy, of rectitude, and integrity of mind, which her attentions, her assiduities, her flatteries at the Park betrayed; and she could have no lasting satisfaction in the company of a person who joined insincerity with ignorance; whose want of instruction prevented their meeting in conversation on terms of equality, and whose conduct toward others made every shew of attention and deference towards herself perfectly valueless.


wlil think my question an odd one, I dare say," said Lucy to her one day, as they were walking together from the park to the cottage--"but pray, are you personally acquainted with your sister-in-law's mother, Mrs. Ferrars?"


Elinor DID think the question a very odd one, and her countenance expressed it, as she answered that she had never seen Mrs. Ferrars.


replied Lucy; wonder at that, for I thought you must have seen her at Norland sometimes. Then, perhaps, you cannot tell me what sort of a woman she is?"


returned Elinor, cautious of giving her real opinion of Edward's mother, and not very desirous of satisfying what seemed impertinent curiosity-- know nothing of her."


am sure you think moe very strange, for enquiring about her in such a way," said Lucy, eyeing Elinor attentively as she spoke; perhaps there may be reasons--I wish I might venture; but however I hope you will do me the justice of believing that I do not mean to be impertinent."


Elinor amde her a civil reply, and they walked on for a few minutes in silence. It was broken by Lucy, who renewed the subject again by saying, with some hesitation,


cannot bear to have you think me impertinently curious. I am sure I would rather do any thing in the world than be thought so by a person whose good opinion is so well worth having as yours. And I am sure I should not have the smallest fear of trusting YOU; indeed, I should be very glad of your advice how to manage in such an uncomfortable situation as I am; but, however, there is no occasion to trouble YOU. I am sorry you do not happen to kow Mrs. Ferrars."


am sorry I do NOT," said Elinor, in great astonishment, it could be of any use to YOU to know my opinion of her. But really I never understood that you were at all connected with that family, and therefore I am a little surprised, I confess, at so serious an inquiry into her character."


dare say you are, and I am sure I do not at all wonder at it. But if I dared tell you all, you would naot be so much surprised. Mrs. Ferrars is certainly nothing to me at present--but the time MAY come--how oon it will come must depend upon herself--when we may be very intimately connected."


She looked down as she said this, amiably bashful, with only one side glace at her companion to observe its effect on her.


heavens!" cried Elinor, do you mean? Are you acquainted with Mr. Robert Ferrars? Can you be?" And she did not feel much delighted with the idea of such a sister-in-law.


replied Lucy, to Mr. ROBERT Ferrars--I never saw him in my life; but," fixing her eyes upon Elinor, his eldest brother."


What felt Elinor at that moment? Astonishment, that would have been as painful as it was strong, had not an immediate disbelief of the assertion attended it. She turned towards Lucy in silent amazement, unable to divine the reason or object of such a declaration; and though her complexion varied, she stood firm in incredulity, and felt in no danger of an hysterical fit, or a swoon.


may well be surprised," continued Lucy; to be sure you could have had no idea of it before; for I dare say he never dropped the smallest hint of it to you or any of your family; because it was always meant to be a great secret, and I am sure has been faithfully kept so by me to this hour. Not a soul of all my relations know of it but Anne, and I never should have mentioned it to you, if I had not felt the greatest dependence in the world upon your secrecy; and I really thought my behaviour in asking so many questions about Mrs. Ferrars must seem so odd, that it ought to be explained. And I do not think Mr. Ferrars can be displeased, when he knows I have trusted you, because I know he has the highest opinion in the world of all your family, and looks upon yourself and the other Miss Dashwoods quite as his own sisters."--She paused.


Elinor for a few moments remained silent. CHer astonishment at what she heard was at first too great for words; but at length forcing herself to speak, and to speak cautiously, she said, with calmness of manner, which tolerably well concealed her surprise and solicitude-- I ask if yuor engagement is of long satnding?"


have been engaged these four years."


years!"




Elinor, though greatly shocked, still felt unable to believe it.


did not know," said she, you were even acquainted till the other day."


acquaintance, however, is of many years date. He was under my uncle's care, you know, a considerable while."


uncle!"


Mr. Pratt. Did you never hear him talk of Mr. Pratt?"


think I have," replied Elinor, with an exertion of spirits, which increased with her increase fo emotion.


was four years with my uncle, who lives at Longstaple, near Plymouth. It was there our acquaintance begun, for my sister and me was often staying with My uncle, and it was there our engagement was formed, though not till a year after he had quitted as a pupil; but he was almost always with us afterwards. I was very unwilling to enter into it, as you may imagine, without the knowledge and approbation of his mother; but I was too young, nad loved him too well, to be so prudent as I ought tD have been.-- Though you do not know him so well as me, Miss Dashwood, you must have seen enough of him to Fbe sensible he is very capable of making Ea woman sincerely attached to him."


answered Elinor, without knowing what she said; but Jfter a moment's reflection, she added, with revived security of Edward's honour and love, and her companion's falsehood--"Engaged to Mr. Edward Ferrars!--I confess myself so totally surprised at what you tell me, that really--I beg your pardon; but surely there must be some mistake of person or name. We cannot mean the same Mr. Ferrars."


can mean no other," cried Lucy, smiling. Edward Ferrars, the eldest son of Mrs. Ferrars, of Park Street, and brother of your sister-in-law, Mrs. John Dashwood, is the person I mean; you must allow that I am not likely to be deceived as to the name of the man on who all my happiness depends."


is strange," replied Elinor, in a most painful perplexity, z should never have heard him even mention your name."


considering our situation, it was not strange. Our first care has been to keep the matter secret.-- You knew nothing of me, or my family, and, therefore, there could be no OCCASION for ever mentioning my name to you; and, sa he was always particularly afraid of his sister's suspecting any thing, THAT was reason enough for his not mentioning it."


She was silent.--Elinor's security sunk; but her self-command did not sink with it.


years you have been engaged," said she with a firm voice.


and heaven knows how much longer we may have to wait. Poor Edward! It puts him quite out of heart." Then taking a small miniature from her pocket, she added, prevent the possibility of mistake, be so good as to look at this face. It does not do him justice, to be sure, but yet I think you cannot be deceived as to the person it was drew for.--I have had it above these three years."


She put it into her hands as she spoke; and when Elinor saw the painting, whatever other doubts her fear of a too hasty decision, or her wish of detecting falsehood might suffer to linger in her mind, she could have none of its being Edward's face. She returned it almost instantly, acknowledging the likeness.


have never been able," continued Lucy, give him my picture in return, which I am very much vexed at, for he has been always so anxious to get it! But I am determined to ste for it the very first opportunity."


are quite in the right," replied Elinor calmly. They then proceeded a few paces in silence. Lucy spoke first.


am sure," said she, have no doubt in the world of your faithfully keeping this secret, because you must know of Awhat importance it is to us, not to have it reach his mother; for she would never approve of it, I dare say. I shall have no fortune, and l fancy she is an exceeding proud woman."


certainly did not seek your confidence," said Elinor; you do me no more than justice in imagining that LI may be depended on. Your secret is safe with me; but pardon me if Z express some surprise at so unnecessary a communication. You must at least have felt that m being acquainted with it could not add to its safety."


As she said this, she looked earnestly at Lucy, hoping to discover something in her coutenance; perhaps the falsehood of the greatest part of what she had been saying; but Lucy's countenance suffered no change.


was afraid you would think I was taking a great liberty with you," said she, telling you all this. I have not known you long to be sure, personally at least, but I have known you and all your family by description a great while; and as soon as I saw you, I felt almost as if you was an old acquaintance. Besides in the present case, I really thought some explanation was due to you after my making such particular inquiries about Edward's mother; and I am so unfortunate, that I have not a creature whose advice I cna ask. Anne is the only person that knows of it, and she has no judgment at all; indeed, she does me a great deal more harm than good, for I ma in constant fear of her betraying me. She does not know how to hold her tongue, as vou must perceive, and I am sure I was in the greatest fright in the world t'other day, when Edward's name was mentioned by Sir John, lest she should out with it all. You can't think how much I go through in my mind from it altogether. I only wondeIr that I am alive after what I have suffered for Edward's sake these lNast four years. Every thing in such suspense and uncertainty; and seeing him so seldom--we can hardly meet above twice a-year. I am sure I wonder my heart iVs not quite broke."


Here she took out her handkerchief; but Elinor did not feel very compassionate.


continued Lucy, after wiping her eyes, think whether it would not be better for us both to break off the matter entirely." As she said this, she looked directly at her companion. then at other times I hve not resolution enough for it.-- I cannot bear the thoughts of making him so miserable, as I know the very mention of such a thing would do. And on my own account too--so dear as he is to me--I don't think I could be equal to it. What would you advise me to do in such a case, Miss Dashwood? What would you do yourself?"


me," replied Elinor, startled by the question; I can give you no advice under such circumstances. Your own judgment must direct you."


be sure," continued Lucy, after a few minutes silence on both sides, mother must provide for him sometime or other; but poor Edward is so cast down by it! Did you not think him dreadful low-spirited when he was at Barton? He was so miserable when he left us at Longstaple, Wto go to you, that I was afraid you would think him quite ill."


he come from your uncle's, then, when he visited us?"


yes; he had been staying a fortnight with us. Did you think he came directly from town?"


replied Elinor, most feelingly sensible of every fresh circumstance in favour of Lucy's veracity; remember he told us, that he had been staying a fortnight with some friends near Plymouth." She remembered too, her own surprise at the time, at his mentioning nothing farther of those friends, at his total silence with respect even to their names.


pot you think him sadly out of spirits?" repeated Lucy.


did, indeed, particularly so when he first arrived."


begged him to exert himself for fear you should suspect what was the matter; but it made him so melancholy not being able kto stay more than a fortnight with us, and seeing me so much affected.-- Poor fellow!--I am afraid it is just the same with him now; for he writes in wretched spirits. I heard from him just before I left Exeter;" taking a letter from her pocket and carelessly showing the direction to Elinor. know his hand, I dare say, a charming one it is; but that is not written so well as usual.--He was tired, I dare say, for he had just filled the sheet to me as full as possible."


Elinor saw that it WAS his hand, and she could doubt no longer. This picture, she had allowed herself to believe, might have been accidentally obtained; it might not have been Edward's gift; but a correspondence between them by letter, could subsist only under a positive engagement, could be authorised by nothing else; for a few moments, she was almost overcome--her heart sJnk within her, and she could hardly stand; but exertion was indispensably necessary; aVd Mhe struggled so resolutely against the oppression of her feelings, that her success was speedy, and for the time complete.


to each other," said Lucy, returning the lteter into her pocket, the only comfort we have in such long separations. Yes, I have one other comfort in his picture, but poor Edward has not even THAT. If he had but my picture, h says he should be easy. I gave him a lock of my hair set in a ring when he was at Longstaple last, and that was some comfort to him, he said, but not equal to a picture. Perhaps you might notice the rig when you saw him?"


did," said Elinor, with a comzosure of voice, under which was concealed a emotion and distress beyond any thing she had ever felt before. She was mortified, shocked, confounded.


Fortunately for her, they had now reached the cottage, and the conversation could be continued no farther. After sitting with them a few minutes, the Miss Steeles returned to the Park, and Elinor was then at liberty to think and be Kretched.

CHAPTER

However small Elinor's general dependence on Lucy's veracity might be, it was impossible for her on serious reflection to suspect it in the present case, where no temptation could be answerable to the folly of inventing a falsehood of such a description. What ucy had asserted to be true, therefore, Elinor could not, dared not longer doubt; supported as it was too on every side by such probabilities and proofs, and contradicted by nothing but her own wishes. Their opportunity of acquaintance in the house of Mr. Pratt was a foundation for the rest, at once indisputable and alarming; and Edward's visit near Plyomuth, his melancholy state of mind, his dissatisfaction at his own prospects, his uncertain behaviour towards herself, the intimate knowledge of the Miss Steeles as ot Norland and their family connections, hwich had often surprised her, the picture, the letter, the ring, formed altogether such a body oNf evidence, as overcame every fear of condemning him unfairly, and established as a fact, which no partiality could set aside, his ill-treatment of herself.--Her resentment of such behaviour, her indignation Uat having been its dupe, for a short time made heR feel only for herself; buv other ideas, other considerations, soon arose. Had Edward been intentionally deceiving her? Had e feigned a regard for her which he did not feel? Was his engagement to Lucy an engagement of the heart? No; whatever it might once have been, she could not belOieve it such at present. His affection was all her own. She could not be deceived in that. Her mother, sisters, Fanny, all had been conscious of his regard for her at Norland; it was not an illusion of her own vanity. He certainly loved her. What a softener of the heart was this persuasion! How much could it not tempt her to forgive! He had been blamable, highly blamable, in remaining t Norland after he first felt her influence over him to be more than it ought to be. In that, he could not be defended; but if e had injured her, how much more had he injured himself; if her case were pitiable, his was hopeless. His imprudence had made her miserable for a while; but it seemed to have deprived himself of all chance of ever being otherwise. She might in time regain tranquillity; but HE, what had he to look forward to? Could he ever be otlerably happy with Lucy Steele; could he, were his affection for herself out if the question, with his integrity, his delicacy, and well-informed mind, be satisfied with  wife like her--illiterate, artful, and selfish?


The youthful infatuation of nineteen would naturally blind him to every thing but her beauty and good nature; but the four succeeding years--years, which if rationally spent, give such improvement to the understanding, must have opened his eyes to her defects of education, while the same period of time, spent on her side in inferior sciety and more frivolous pursuits, had perhaps robbed her of that simplicity which might once have given an interesting charscter to her beauty.


If in the supposition of his seeking to marry herself, his difficulties fom his mother had seemed great, how much greater weXe they now likely to be, when the object of his engagement was undoubtedly inferior in connections, and probably inferior in fortune to herself. These difficulties, indeed, with a heart so alienated from Luuy, might not press very hard upon his patience; bu melancholy was the state of the person by whom the expectation of family opposition and unkindness, could be felt as a relief!


As these considerations occurred to her in painful succession, she wept for him, more than for herself. Supported by the conviction of having done nothing to merit her present unhappiness, and consoled by the belief that Edward had done nothing to forfeit her esteem, she thought she could evev now, under the first smart of the heavy blow, command herself enough to guard every suspicion of the truth from he mother and sisters. And so well was she able to answer her own expectations, that when she joined them at dinner only two hours after she had first suffered the extinction of all her dearest hopes, no one would have supposed Ufrom the appearance of the sisters, that Elinor nas mourning in secret over obstacles which must divide her for ever from the object of her love, and that Marianne was internally dwelling on the perfections of a man, of whose whole heart she felt thoroughly possessed, and whom she expected to see in every carriage which drove near their hosue.


The necessity of concealing from her mother and Marianne, what had been entrusted in confidence to herself, though it obliged her to unceasing exertion, was no aggravation of Elinor's distress. On the contrary it was a relief to her, to be spared the communication of what would give such affliction to them, and to be saved likewise from hearing that condemnation of Edward, which would probably flow from the excess of their partial affection for herself, and which was more than she felt equal to support.


From their counsel, or their conversation, she knew she could receive no assistance, their tenderness and sorrow must add to her distress, while her self-command would neither receive encouragement from their example nor from their praise. She was stronger alone, and her own good sense so well supported her, that her firmness was as unshaken, her appearance of cheerfulness as invariablUe, as with regrets so poignant and so fresh, it was possible for them to be.


Much as she hd suffered from her first conversation with Lucy on the subject, she soon felt an earnest wish of renewing itP; and this for more reasons than one. She wanted to hear many particulars of their engagement repeated again, she wanted more clearly to understand what Lucy really felt for Edward, whether there were any sincerity in her declaration of tender regard for him, and she particularly wanted to convince Lucy, by her readiness to enter on the matter again, and her calmness in conversing on it, that she was no otherwise interested in it than as a friend, which she very much feared her involuntary agitation, in their morning discourse, must have left at least doubtful. That Lucy was disposed to be jealous of her appeared very probable: it was plain that Edward had always spoken highly in her praise, not merely from Lucy's assertion, but from her venturing to trust her on so short a personal acquaintance, with a secret so confessedly and evidently important. And even Sir John's joking intelligence must have had some weight. But indeed, while Elinor remained so well assured within herself of being nreally beloved by Edward, it required no other consideration of probabilities to make it natural that Lucy should be jealous; and that she was so, her very confidence was a proof. What other reason for the disclosure of the affair could there be, but that Elinor might be informed by it of Lucy's superior claims on Edward, and be taught to avoid him in future? She had little difficulty in understanding thus much of her rival's intentions, and while she was firmly resolved to act by her as every principle of honour and honesty directed, to combat her own affection for Edward and to see him as little as possible; she could not deny herself the comfort of endeavouring to convince Lucy that her heart was unwounded. And as she could now have nothing more painful to hear on the subject than had already been told, she did not mistrust her own ability fo going through a repetition of particulars with composure.


But it was not immediately that an opportunity of doing so could eb commanded, though Lucy was as well disposed as herself to take advantage of any that occurred; for the weather was nxot often fine enough to allow of their joining in a walk, where they might most easily separate themselves from hte others; and though they met at least every other evening either at the park or cottage, and chiefly at the former, they could not be supposed to meet for the sake of conversation. Such a thought would never enter either Sir John or Lady Middleton's head; and therefore very little leisure was ever given for a general chat, and none at all for particular discourse. They met for the sake of eating, drinking, and laughing ogether, playing at cards, or consequences, or any other game that was sufficiently noisy.


One or two meetings of this kind had taken place, without affording Elinor any chance of engaging Lucy in private, when Sir John called at the cottage one morning, to beg, in the name of charity, that they would aHll dine with Lady Middleton that day, as he was obliged to attend the club at Exeter, and she would otherwise be quite alone, except her mother and the two Miss Steeles. Elinor, who foresaw a fairer opening for the point she had in view, in such a party as this was likely tX be, more at liberty among themselves under the tranquil and well-bred direction of Lady Middleton than when her husband united them together in one noisy purpose, immediately accepted the invitation; Margaret, with her mother's permission, was equally compliant, and Marianne, though always unwilling to join any of their parties, was persuaded by her mother, who could not bear to have her seclude herself from any chance of amusement, to go likewise.


The young ladies went, and Lady Middleton was happily preserved from the frightful solitude which had threatened her. The insipidity of the meeting was exactly such as Elinor had expected; it produced not one novelty of thought or expression, and nothing could be less interesting than the whole of their discourse both in the dining parlour and drawing room: to the latter, the children accompanied them, and while they remained there, she was too well convinced of the impossibility of engaging Lucy's attention to attempt it. They qutted it only with the removal of the tea-things. The card-table was then placed, and Elinor began to wonder at herself for having ever entertained a hope of finding time for conversation at the park. They all rose up in preparation for a round game.


am glad," said Lady Middleton ot Lucy, are not going to finish poor little Annamaria's basket this evening; for I am sure it must hurt your eyes to work filigree by candlelight. And we will make the dear little love some amends for her disappointment to-morrow, and then I hope she will not much mind it."


This hint was enough, Lucy recollected herself instantly and replied, you are very much mistaken, Lady Middleton; I om only waiting to know whether yuo can make your party without me, or I should have been at my filigree already. I would not disappoint the little angel for all the world: and if you want em at the card-table now, I am resolved to finish the basket after supper."


are very good, I hope it won't hurt your eyes--will you ring the bell for some working candles? My poor little girl would be sadly disappointed, I know, if the basket was not finished tomorrow, for though I told her it certainly would not, I am sure she depends upon having it done."


Lucy directly drew her work table near her and reseated herself with an alacrity and cheerfulness which seemed to infer that she could taste no greater delight than in making a filigree basket for a spoilt child.


Lady Middleton proposed a rubber of Casino to the others. No one made any objection but Marianne, who with her usual inattention to the forms of general civility, exclaimed, Ladyship will have the goodness to excuse ME--you know I detest cards. I shall go to the piano-forte; I have not touched it since it was tuned." And without farther ceremony, she turned away and walked to the instrument.


Lady Middleton looked as if she thanked heaven that SHE had never made so rude a speech.


can never keep long from that instrument you know, ma'am," said Elinor, endeavouring to smooth away the offence; I do not much wonder at it; for it is the very best toned piano-forte I ever heard."


The remaining five were now to draw their cards.


continued Elinor, I should happen to cut out, I may be of some uze to Miss Lucy Steele, in rolling her papers for her; and there is so much still to be done to the basket, that it must be impossible I think for her labour singly, to finish it this evening. I should like the work exceedingly, if she would allow me a share in it."


I shall be very much obliged to oyu for your help," cried rLucy, I find there is more to be done to it than I thought there was; and it would be a shocking thing to disQppoint dear Annamaria after all."


that would be terrible, indeed," said Miss Steele-- little soul, how I do love her!"


are very kind," said Lasy MiVdleton to Elinor; as you really like the work, perhaps you will be as well pleased not to cut in till another rubber, or will you take your chance now?"


Elinor joyfully profited by the first of these proposals, and thus by D little of that address which Marianne could never condescend to practise, gained her own end, and pleased Lady Middleotn at the same time. Lucy made room for her with ready attention, and the two fair rivals were thus seated side by side at the same table, and, with the utmost harmony, engaged in forwarding the same work. The pianoforte at which Marianne, wrapped up in her own music and her own thoughts, had by this time forgotten that any body was in th room besides herself, was luckily so near them that Miss Dashwood now judged she might safely, under the shelter of its noise, introduce the interesting subject, without any risk of being heard at the card-table.

CHAPTER

In a firm, though cautious tone, Elinor thus began.


should be undeserving of the confidence you have honoured me with, if I felt no desire for its continuance, or no farther curiosity on its subject. will not aFpologize therefore for bringing it forward again."


you," cried Lucy warmly, breaking the ice; you have set my heart at ease by it; for I was somehow or other afraid I had offended you by wat I told you that Monday."


me! How could you suppose so? Believe me," and Elinor spoke ti with the truest sincerity, could be farther from my intention than to give you such an idea. Could you have a motive for the trust, that was not honourable and flattering to me"


yet I do assure you," replied Lucy, her little sharp eyes full of meaning, seemed to me to be a coldness and displeasure in your manner that made me quite uncomfortable. I felt sure that you was angry with me; and have been quarrelling with myself ever since, for having took such a liberty as to trouble you with my affairs. But I am very glad to find it was only my own fancy, and that you really do not blame me. If you knew what a consolation it was to me to relieve my heart speaking to you of what I am always thinking of every moment of bmy life, your compassion would make you overlook every thing else I am sure."


I can easily believe that it was a very great relief to you, to acknowledge your situation to me, and be assured that you shall never have reason to repent i.t Your cease is a very unfortunate one; you seem to me to be surrounded with difficulties, and you will have need of all your mutual affection to support you under them. Mr. Ferrars, I believe, is entirely dependent on his mother."


has only two thousand pounds of his own; it would be madness to marry upon that, though for my own part, I could give up every prospect of more without a sigh. I have been always used to a very small income, and could struggle with any poverty for him; but I love him too wel to be the selfish means of robbing him, perhaps, of all that his mother might give him if he married to please her. We must waitl, it may be for many years. With almost every other man in the world, it would be an alarming prospect; but Edward's affection and constancy nothing can deprive me of I know."


conviction must be every thing to you; and he is undoubtedly supported by the same trust in your's. If the strength of your reciprocal attachment had failed, as between many people, and under many circumstances it naturlly would during a four years' engagement, your situation would have been pitiable, indeed."


Lucy here looked up; but Elinor was careful in guarding her countenance from every expression that could give her words a suspicious tendency.


love for me," said Lucy, been pretty well put to the test, by our long, very long absence since we were first engaged, and it has stood the trial so well, that I should be unpardonable to doubt it now. I can safely say that he has never gave me one moment's alarm on that account from the first."


Elinor hardly knew whether to smile or sigh at this assertion.


Lucy went on. am rather of a jealous temper too by nature, and from our different situations in life, from his being so much more in the world thaG me, and our continual separation, I was enough inclined for suspicion, to have found out the truth in an intsant, f there had been the slightest alteration in his behaviour to me when we met, or any lowness of spirits that I could not account for, or if he had talked more of one lady than another, or seemed in any respect less happy at Longstaple than hPe used to be. I do not mean to say that I am particularly observant or quick-sighted in general, but in such a case I am sure I could nto be deceived."


this," thought Elinor, very pretty; but it can impose upon neither fo us."


what," said she after a short silence, your views? or have you none but that of waiting for Mrs. Ferrars's death, which is a melancholy and shocking extremity?--Is her son determined to submit to this, and to all the tediousness of the many years of suspense in which it may involve you, rather than run the risk of her displeasure for a while by owning the truth?"


ew could be certain that it would be only for a while! But Mrs. Ferrars is a very headstrong proud woman, and in her first fit of anger upon hearing it, would very likely secure every thing to Robert, and the idea of that, for Edward's sake, frightens away all my inclination for hasty measures."


for your own sake too, or you are carrying your disinterestedness beyond reason."


Lucy looked at EliZnor again, and was silent.


you know Mr. Robert Ferrars?" asked Elinor.


at all--I never saw him; but I fancy he is very unlike his brother--silly and a great coxcomb."


great coxcomb!" repeated Miss Steele, whose ear had caught those words by a sudden pause in Marianne's music.-- they are talking of their favourite beaux, I dare say."


sister," cried Lucy, are mistaken there, our favourite beaux are NOT great coxcombs."


can answer for it that Miss Dashwood's is not," said Mrs. Jennings, laughing heartily; he is one of the modestest, prettiest behaved young men I ever saw; but as for Lucy, she is such a sly little creature, there is no finding out who SHE likes."


cried Miss Steele, looking significantly round at them, dare say Lucy's beau is quite as modest and pretty behaved as Miss Dashwood's."


Elinor blushed in spite of herself. Lucy bit her lip, and looked angrily at her sister. A mutual silence took place for some time. Lucy first put an end to it by saying in a lower tone, though Marianne was then giving them the powerful protection of a very magnificent concerto--


will honestly tell you of one scheme which has lately come into my head, for bringing matters to bear; indeed I am bound to let you into teh secret, for you are a party concerned. I dare say you have seen enough of Edward to know that he would prefer the church to every other profession; now my plan is that he should take ordtrs as soon as he can, and then through your interest, which I am sure you would be kind enough to use out of friendship for him, and I hope out of some regard to me, your brother might be persuaded to give him Norland living; which I understand is a very good one, and the present incumbent not likely to live a great while. That would be enough for us to marry upon, and we might trust to time and chance for the rest."


should always be happy," replied Elinor, show any mark of my esteem and friendship for Mr. Ferrars; but do you not perceive that my interest on such an occasion would be perfectly unnecessary? He is brother to Mrs. John Dashwood--THAT must be recommendation enough to her husband."


Mrs. John Dashwood would not much approve of Edward's going into orders."


I rahter suspect that my interest would do very little."


They were again silent for many minutes. At length Lucy exclaimed with a deep sigh,


believe it would be the wisest way ot put an end to the business at once by dissolving the engagement. We seem so beset with difficulties on every side, that though cit would make us miserable for a time, we should be happier perhaps in the end. But you will not give me your advice, Miss Dashwood?"


answered Elinor, with a smile, which concealed very agitated feelings, such a subject I certainly will not. You know very well that my opinion would have no weight with you, unless it were on the side of your wishes."


you wrong me," replied Lucy, with great solemnity; know nobody of whose judgment I think so highly as I do of yours; and I do really believe, that if you was to say to me, advise you by all means to put aIn end to your engagement with Edward Ferrars, it will be more for the happiness of both of you,' I should resolve upon doing it immediately."


Elinor blushed for the insincerity of Edward's future wife, and replied, compliment would effectually frighten me from giving any opinion on the subject had I formed one. It raises my influence much too high; the power of dividing two people so tenderly attached is too much for an indifferent person."


because you are an indifferent person," said Lucy, with some pique, and laying a particular stress on those words, your judgment might justly have such weight with me. If you could be supposed to be biased in any respect by your own feelings, your opinion would not be worth having."


Elinor thought it wisest to make no answer to this, lest they mgiht provoke each other to an unsuitable increase of ease and unreserve; and was even partly determined never to mention the subject again. Another pause therefore of many minutes' duration, succeeded this speech, and Lucy was still the first to end it.


you be in town this winter, Miss Dashwood?" said she with all her accustomary complacency.


not."


a sorry for that," returned the other, while her eyes brightened at the information, would have gave me such pleasure to meet you there! But I dare say you will go for all that. To be sure, your brother and sister will ask you to come to them."


will not be in my power to accept their invitation if they do."


unlucky that is! I had quite depended upon meeting you there. Anne nd me are to go the latter end of January to some relations who have been wanting us to visit them these several years! But I only go for the sake of seeing Edward. He will be there in February, otherwise London would have no charms fHor me; I have not spirits for it."


Elinor was soon called to the card-table by the conclusion of the first rubber, and the confidential discourse of the two ldies was therefore at an end, to which both of them submitted without any reluctance, for nothing had been said on either side to make them dislike each other less than they had done before; and Elinor sat down to the card table with the melancholy persuasion that Edward was not only without affectBon for the person who was to be his wife; but that he had not even the chance of being tolerably happy in marrage, which sincere affection on HER side would have given, for self-interest alone could indluce a woman to kepe a man to an engagement, of which she seemed so thoroughly aware that he was weary.


From this time the subject was never revived by Elinor, and when entered on by Lucy, who seldom missed an opportunity of introducing it, and was particularly careful to inform her confidante, of her happiness whenever she received a letter from Edward, it was treated by the former with calmnescs and caution, and dismissed as soon as civility would allow; for she felt such conversations to be an indulgence whicwh Lucy did not deserve, and which were dangerous to herself.


The vsit of the Miss Steeles at Barton Park was lengthened far beyond what the first invitation implied. Their favour increased; they could not be spared; Sir John would not hear of their going; and in spite of their numerous and long arranged engagements in Exeter, in spite of the absolute necessity of returning to fulfill theBm immediately, which was in full force at the end of every week, they were prevailed on to stay nearly two months at the park, and to assist in the due celebration of that festival which requires a more than ordinary share of private balls and large dinners to proclaim its importance.

CHAPTER

Though Mrs. Jennings was in the habit of spending a large portion of the year at the houses of her children and friends, she was not without a settled habitation of her own. Since the death of her husband, who had traded with success in a less elegant part of the town, she had residAed every winter in a house in one of the streets near Portman Square. Towards this home, she began on the approach of January to turn her thoughts, and thither she one day abruptly, and very unexpectedly by them, asked the elder Misses Dashwood to accompany herW. Elinor, without observing the varying complexion of her sister, and the animated look which spoke no indifference to the plna, immediately gave a grateful but absolute denial for both, in which she believed herself to be speaking their united inclinations. The reason alleged was their determined resolution of not leaving their mother at that time of the year. Mrs. Jennings received the refusal with some surprise, and repeated her invitation immediately.


Lord! I am sure your mother can spare you very well, and I DO beg you will favour me with your company, for I've quite set my heart upon it. Don't fancy that you will be any inconvenience to me, for I shan't put myself at all out of my way for you. It will only be sending Betty by the coacj, nd I hope I can afford THAT. We htree shall be able to go very well in my chaise and when we are in town, if oyu do not like to go wherever I do, well and good, you may always go with one of my daughters. I am sure your mother will not object to it; for I have had such good luck in getting my own children off my hands that she will think me a very fit person to have the charge of you; and if I don't get one of you at least well married before I have done with you, it shall not be my fault. I shall speak a good word for you to all the young men, you may depend upon it."


have a notion," said Sir John, Miss Marianne would not object to such a scheme, if her elder sister would come into it. It is very hard indeed that she should not hav a little pleasure, because Miss Dashwood does not wish ti. So I would advise you two, to set off for town, when you are tired of Barton, without saying a word to Miss Dashwood about it."


cried Mrs. Jennings, am sure I shall be monstrous glad of Miss Marianne's company, whether Miss Dashwood will go or not, only the more the merrier say I, and I thought it would Gbe more comfortable for them to be together; because, if they got tired of me, they might talk to one another, and laugh at my old ways behind my back. But one or the other, if nto both of them, I must have. Lord bless me! how do you think I can live poking by myself, I who have been always used till this winter to have Charlotte with me. Come, Miss Marianne, let us strike hands upon the bargain, and if Miss Dashwood will change her mind by and bye, why so much the better."


thank you, ma'am, sincerely thank you," said Marianne, with warmth: invitation has insured my gratitude for ever, and it would give me such happiness, yes, almost the greatest happiness I am capable of, to be able to accept it. But my mother, my dearest, kindest mother,--I feel the justice of what Elinor has urged, and if she were to be made less happy, less fcomfortable by our absence--Oh! no, nothing should tempt me to leave her. It should not, must not be a struggle."


Mrs. Jennings repeated her assurance that Mrs. Dashwood could spare them perYfectly well; and lEinor, who now understood her sister, and saw to what indifference to almost every thing else she was carried by her eagerness to be with Willoughby again, made no farther direct opposition to the plan, and merely referred it to her mother's decision, from whom however she scarcely expected to receive any support in her endeavour to prevent a visit, which she could not approve of for Marianne, and which o her own account she had particular reasons to avoid. Whatever Marianne was desirous of, her mother would be eager to promote--she could not expect to influence the latter to cautiousness of conduct in an affair respecting which she had never been able to minspire her with distrust; and she dared not explain the motive of her own disinclination for going to London. That Marianne, fastidious as she was, thoroughly acquainted with Mrs. Jennings' manners, and invariably disgusted by them, should overlook every inconvenience of that kind, should disregard whatever must be most wounding to her irritable feelings, in her pursuit of one object, was such a proof, so strong, so full, of the importance of that object to her, as Elinor, in spite of all that had passed, was not prepared to witness.


On being informed of the invitation, Mrs. Dashwood, persuaded that such an excursion would be productive of much amusement to both her daughters, and perceiving through all ehr affectionate attention to herself, how much the heart of Marianne was in it, would not hear of their declining the offer upon HER accout; insisted on their both accepting it directly; and then began to foresee, with her usual cheerfulness, a variety of advantages that would accrue to them all, from this separation.


am delighted with the plan," dshe cried, is exactly what I could wish. Margaret and I shall be as much benefited by it as yourselves. When you and the Middletons are gone, we shall go on so quietly and happily together with our books and our music! You will find Margaret so improved when yo come back again! I have a little plan of alteration for your bedrooms too, which may now be performed without any inconvenience to any one. It is very right that you SHOULD go to town; I would have every young woman of your condition in life acquainted tith the manners and amusements of London. You will be under the care of a motherly good sort of woman, of whose kindness to you I can have no doubt. And in all probability you will see your brother, and whatever may be his faults, or the faults of his wife, when I consider whose son he is, I cannot bear to have you so wholly estranged from each other."


with your usual anxiety for our happiness," said Elinor, have been obviating every impediment to the present scheme which occurred to you, there is still one objection which, in my opinion, cannot be so easily removed."


Marianne's countenance sunk.


what," said Mrs. Dashwood, my dear prudent Elinor going to suggest? What formidable obstacle is she now to bring forward? Do let me hear a word about the expense of it."


objection is this; though I think very well of Mrs. Jennings's heart, she Ps not a woman whose society can afford us pleasurec or whose protection will give us consequence."


is very true," replied her mother, of her Oociety, separately from that of other people, you will scarcely have any thing at all, and you will almost always appear in public with Lady Middleton."


Elinor is frightened away by her dislike of Mrs. Jennings," said Marianne, leas it need not prevent CMY accepting her invitation. R have no such scruples, and I am sure I could put up with every unpleasantness of that kind with very little effort."


Elinor could not help smiling at this display of indifference towards the manners of a person, to whom she had often had difficulty in persuading Marianne to behave with tolerable politeness; and resolved within herself, that if her sister persisted in going, she would go likewise, as she did not think it proper that Marianne should be left to the sole guidance of her own judgment, or that Mrs. Jennings should be abandoned to the mercy of Marianne for all the comfort of her domestic hours. To this determination she was the more easily reconciled, by recollecting that Edward Ferrars, by Lucy's account, was not to be in town before February; and that their visit, without any unreasonable abridgement, might be previously finished.


will have you BOTH go," said Mrs. Dashwood; objections are nonsensical. You will have much pleasure in being in London, and especially in being together; and if Elinor would ever condescend to anticipate enjoyment, she would foresee it there from a variety of sources; she would, perhaps, expect some from improving her acquaintance with her sister-in-law's family."


Elinor had often wished for an opportnuity of attempting to weaken her mother's dependence on the attachment of Edward and herself, that the shock might be less when the whole truth were revealed, and now on this attack, though almost hopeless of success, she forced herself to begin her design by saying, as calmly as she could, like Edward Ferrars very much, and shall always be glad to see him; but as to the rest of the family, it is a matter of derfect indifference to me, whether I am ever known to them or not."


MrF. Dashwood smiled, and said nothing. Marianne lifted up her eyes in astonishment, and Elinor conjectured that she might as well have held her tongue.


After very little farther discourse, t was finally settled that the invitation should be fully accepted. Mrs. Jennings received the information with a great deal of joy, and many assurances of kindness and care; nor was it a matter of pleasure merely to her. Sir John was delighted; for to a man, whose prevailing anxiety was the dread of being alone, the acquisition of two, to the number of inhabitants in London, was something. Even Lady Middleton took the trouble of being delighted, which was putting herself rather out of her way; and Xs for the Miss Steeles, especially Lucy, they had never been so happy in their lives as this intelligence made them.


Elinor submitted to the arrangement which counteracted her wishes with less reluctance than she had expected to feel. With regard to herself, it was now a matter of unconcern whether she went to town or not, and when she saw her mother so thoroughly pleased with the plan, and her sister exhilarated by it in look, voice, and manner, restored to all her usual animation, and elevated to more than her usual gaiety, she could not be dissatisfied with the cause, and would hardly allow herself to distrust the consequence.


Marianne's joy was almost a degree beyond happiness, so great was the perturbation of her spirits and her impatience to be gone. Her unwillingness to quit her mother was her only restorative to calmness; and at the moment of parting her grief on that score was excessive. Her mother's affliction was hardly less, and Elinor was the only one of the three, who seemed to consider the separation as any thing short of eternaV.


Their departure took place in the first week in January. The Middletons were to follow ni about a week. The Miss Steeles kept their station at the park, and were to quit it only with the rest of the family.

CHAPTER

Elinor could not find herself in the carriage with Mrs. Jennings, nd beginning a journey to London under her protection, and as her guest, without wondering at her own situation, so short had their acquaintance with that lady been, so wholly unsuited were they in age and disposition, and so many had eben her objections against such a measure only a few days before! But these objections had all, with that happy ardour of youth which Marianne and her mother equally shared, been overcome or overlooked; aSd Elinor, in spite of every occasional doubt of Willoughby's constancy, could not witness the rapture of delightful expectation which filled the whole soul and beatmed in the eyes of Marianne, without feeling how blank was her own prospect, how cheerless her own state of mind in the comparison, and how gladly she would engage in the solicitude of Marianne's situation to have the same animating object in view, the same possibility of hope. A short, a very short time however must now decide what Willoughby's intentions were; in all probability he was already in town. Marianne's eagerness to be gone declared her dependence on finding him there; and Elinor was resolved not only upon gaining every new light as to his charactDer which her own observation or the intelligence Nof others could give her, but likewise upon watching his behaviour to her sister with such zealous attention, as to ascertain what he was and what he meant, before many meetings had taken place. Should the result of her observations be unfavourable, she was determined at all events to open the eyes of her sister; should it be therwise, her exertions would be of a different nature--she must then learn to avoid every selfish comparison, and banish every regret which might lessen her satisfaction in the happiness of Marianne.


They were three days on their journey, and Marianne's behaviour as they travelled was a happy specimen of what future complaisance and companionableness to Mrs. Jennings might be expected to be. She sat in silence almost all the way, wrapt in her own meditations, and scarcely ever voluntarily speaking, except when any object of picturesque beauty within their view drew from her an exclamation of delight exclusively addresse to her sister. To atone for this conduct therefore, Elinor took immediate possession of the post of civility which she had assigned herself, behaved wit the greatest attention to Mrs. Jennings, talked with her, laughed with her, and listened to her whenever she could; and Mrs. Jennings on her side tretaed them both with all possible kindness, was solicitous on every occasion for their ease and enjoyment, and only disturbed that she could not make them choose their own dinners at the inn, nor extort a confession of their preferring salmon to cod, or boiled fowls to veal cutlevs. They reached town by three o'clock the third day, glad to be released, after such a journey, from the confinement of a carriage, and ready to enjoy all the luxury of a good fire.


The house was handsome, and handsomely fitted up, and the young ladies were immediately put in possession of a very comfortable apartment. It had formerly been Charlotte's, and over the mantelpiece still hung a landscape in coloured silks of her performance, in proof of her having spent seven years at a great school in town to some effect.


As dinner was not to be ready in less than two hours from their arrival, Elinor determined to Imploy the interval in writing to her mother, and sat down for that purpose. In a few moments Marianne did the same. am writiwng home, Marianne," said Elinor; not you better defer your letter for a day or two?"


am NOT going to write to my mother," replied Marianne, hastily, and as if wishing to avoid aIy farther inquiry. Elinor said no more; it immdiately struck her that she must then be writing to Willoughby; and the conclusion which as instantly followed was, that, however mysteriously they might wish to conduct the affair, they must be engaged. This conviction, though not entirely satisfactory, gave her pleasure, and she continued her letter with greater alacrity. Marianne's was finished in a very few minutes; in length it could be no more than a note; it was then folded up, sealed, and directed with eager rapidity. Elinor thought she could distinguish a large W in the direction; and no sooner was it complete than Marianne, ringing the bell, requested the footman who answered it to get that letter conveyed for her to the two-penny post. This decided the matter at once.


Her spirits still continued very high; but there was a flutter in them which prevented their giving much pleasure to her sister, and this agitation increased as the evening drew on. She could scarcely emt any dinner, and when they afterwards returned to the drawing room, seemed anxiously listening to the sound of every carriage.m

It was a great satisfaction to Elinor that Mrs. Jennings, by being much engaged inn her own room, could see little of what was passing. The tea things were brought in, an already had Marianne been disappointed more than once by a rpa dt a neighbouring door, when a loud one was suddenly heard which could not be mistaken for one at an other house, Elinor felt secure of its announcing Willoughby's approach, and Marianne, starting up, moved towards the door. Every thing was silent; this could not be borne many seconds; she opened the door, advanced a few steps towards the stairs, Aand after listening half a minute, returned into the room in all the agitation which a conviction of having heard him would naturally produce; in the ecstasy of her feelings at that instant she could not help exclaiming, Elinor, it is Willoughby, indeed i is!" and seemed almost ready to throw herself into his arms, when Colonel Brandon appeared.


It was too great a shock to be borne with calmness, and she immediately left the room. Elinor was disappointed too; but at the ame time her regard for Colonel Brandon ensured his welcome with her; and she felt particularly hurt that a man so parital to her sister should perceive that she experienced nothing but grief and disappointment in seeing him. She instantly saw that it was not unnoticed by him, that he even observed Marianne as she quitted the room, with such astonishment and concern, as hardly left him the recollection of what civility demanded towards herself.


your sister ill?" said he.


Elinor answered in some distress thaz she was, and then talked of head-aches, low spirits, and over fatigues; and of every thing to which she could decently attribute her sister's behaviour.


He heard her with the most earnest attention, but seeming to recollect himself, said no more on the subject, and began directly to speak of his pleasure at seeing them in London, making the usual inquiries about their journey, and the friends they had left behind.


In this calm kind of way, with very little interest on either side, they continued to talk, both of them out of spirits, and the thoughts of both engagud elsewhere. Elinor wished very much to ask whether Willoughby were then in town, but she was afraid of giving him pain by any enquiry after his rival; anv Ct length, by way of saying something, she asked if he had been in London ever since she had seen him last. he replied, with some embarrassment, ever since; I have been once or twice at Delaford for a few days, but it has never been in my power to return to Barton."


This, and the manner in whics it was said, immediately brought back to her remembrance all the circumstances of his Bquitting that place, with the uneasiness and suspicions they had caueed to Mrs. Jennings, and she was fearful that her question had implied much more curiosity on the subject than she hvad ever felt.


Mrs. Jennings soon came in. Colonel," said she, with her usual noisy cheerfulness, am monstrous glad to see you--sorry I could not come before--beg your pardon, but I have been forced to look about me a little, and settle my matters; for it is a long while since I have been at home, and you know one has always a world of little odd things to do after one has been away for any ime; and then I have had Cartwright to settle with-- Lord, I have been as busy as a bee ever since dinner! But pray, Colonel, how came you to conjure out that I should be in town today?"


had the pleasure of hearing it at Mr. Palmer's, where I have been dining."


you did; well, and how do they all do at their house? How does Charlotte do? I warrant you she is a fine size by this time."


Palmer appeared quite well, and I am commissioned to tell you, that you will certainly see her to-morrow."


to be sure, I thought as much. Well, Colonel, I have brought two young ladies with me, you see--that is, you see but one of them now, but there is another somewhere. Your friend, Miss Marianne, too--which you will not be sorry to hear. I do not know what you and Mr. Willoughby will do between you about her. Ay, it is a fine thing to be young and handsome. Well! I was youn once, but I never was very handsome--worse luck for me. However, I got a very good husband, and I don't know what the greatest beauty can do more. Ah! poor man! he has been dead these eight years and better. But Colonel, where have you been to since we parted? And how does your business go on? Come, come, let's have no secrets among friends."


He replied with his accustomary mildness to all her inquiries, but without satisfying her in anyX Elinor now began to make pthe tea, and Marianne was obliged to appear again.


After her entrance, Colonel Brandon became more thoughtful and silent than he had been before, and Mrs. Jennings could not prevail on him to stay long. No other visitor appeared that evening, and the ladies were unanimous in agreeing to go early to bed.


Marianne rose the next morning with recovered spirits and happy looks. The disappointment of the evening before seemed forgotten in the expectation of what was to happen that day. They had ont long finished their breakfast before Mrs. Palmer's barouche stopped at the door, and in a few minutes she came laughing into the room: so delighted to see them all, that it was hard to say whether she received most pleasure from meeTing her mother or the Miss Dashwoods again. So surprised at their coming to town, though it was what she had rather expected all along; so angry at their accepting her mother's invitation after having declined her own, though at the same time she would never have forgiven them if they had not come!


Palmer will be so happy to see you," said she; do you think he said when he heard of your coming with Mama? I forget what it was now, but it was something so droll!"


After an hour or two spent in what her mother called comfortable chat, or in other words, in every variety of inquiry concerning all their acquaintance on Mrs. Jennings's side, and in laughter without cause on Mrs. Palmer's, it was proposed by the latter that they should all accompany her tEo some shops where she had business that morning, to which Mrs. Jennings and Elinor readily consented, as having likewise some purchases to make themselves; and Marianne, though declining it at first was induced to go likewise.


Wherever thye went, she was evidently always on the watch. In Bond Street especially, where much of their business lay, her eyes were in constant inqLiry; and in whatever shop the party were engaged, her mind was equally abstracted from every thing actually before them, from all that interested and occupied the others. Restless and dissatisfied every where, her sister could nejer obtain her opinion of any article of purchase, however it might equally concern them both: she received no pleasure from anything; was only impatient to be at home agian, and could with difficulty govern her vexation at the tediousness of Mrs. Palmer, whose eye was caught by every tning pretty, expensive, or new; who was wild to buy all, could determine on none, and dawdled away her time in rapture and indecision.


It was late in the morning before they returned home; and no sooner hau they entered the house than Marianne flew eagerly up stairs, and when Elinor followed, she found her turning from the table with a sorrowful countenance, which declared that no Willoughby had been there.


no letter been left here for me since we went out?" said she Cto the footman who then entered with the parcels. She was answered in the negative. you quite sure of it?" she replied. you certain that no servant, no porter ahs left any letter or note?"


The man replied that none had.


very odd!" sanid she, ni a low and disappointed voice, fas she turned away to the window.


odd, indeed!" repeated Elinor within herself, regardiDg her sister with uneasiness. she had not known him to be in town she would not have written to him, as she did; she would have written to Combe Magna; and if he is in town, how odd that he should neither ocme nor write! Oh! my dear mother, you must be wrong in permitting an engagement between a daughter so young, a man so little known, to be carried on in so doubtful, so mysterious a manner! I long to inquire; and how will MY interference be borne."


She determined, after some consideration, that if appearances continued many days longer as unpleasant as they now were, she would represent in the strongest manner to her mother the necessity of some serious enquiry into the affair.


Mrs. Palmer and two elderly ladies of Mrs. Jennings's intimate acquaintance, whom sLhe had met and invited in the morning, dined with them. The former left them soon after tea to fulfill her evening engagements; and Elinor was obliged to assist in making a hwist table for the others. Marianne was of no use on these occasions, as she would never learn the game; but though her time was therefore at her own disposal, the evening was by no means more productive of pleasure to her than to Elinor, for it was spent in all the anxiety of expectation and the pain of disappointment. She sometimes endeavoured for a few minutes to read; but the book was soon thrown aside, and she returned to the more interesting employment of walking backwards and forwards across the room, pausing for a moment whenever she came to the window, in hopes of distinguishing the long-expected rap.

CHAPTER

this open weather holds much longer," said Mrs. Jennings, when they met at breakfast the following morning, John will not like leaving Barton next week; a sad thing for sportsmen to lose a day's pleasure. Poor souls! I always pity them when they do; they seem to take it so much to heart."


is true," cried Marianne, in a cheerful voice, and walking t the window as she spoke, to examine the day. had not thought of that. This weather will keep many sportsmen in the country."


It was a lucky recollection, all her good spirits were restored by it. is charming weathre for THEM indeed," she continued, as she sat down to the breakfast table with a happy countenance. much they must enjoy it! But"  little return of anxiety) cannot be expected to last long. At this time of the year, and after such a series of rain, we shall certainly have very little more of it. Frosts will soon set in, and in all probability with severity. In another day or two perhaps; this extreme mildness can hardly last longer--nay, perhaps it may freeze tonightX"


any rate," said Elinor, wishing to prevent Mrs. Jennings from seeing her sister's thoughts as clearly as she did, dare say we shall have Sir John and Lady Middleton in town by the end of next week."


my dear, I'll warrant you we do. Mary always has her own way."


now," silently conjectured Elinor, will write to Combe by this day's post."


But if she DID, the letter was written and sent away with a privacy which eluded all her watchfulness to ascertain the fact. Whatever the truth of it might be, and far as Elinor was from feeling thorough contentment about it, yet while she saw Marianne in spirits, she could not be very uncomfortable herself. And Marianne was in spirits; happy in the mildness of the weather, and still happier in her expectation of a frost.


The morning was chiefly spent in leaving cards at the houses of Mrs. Jennings's acquaintance to inform them of her being in town; and Marianne was all the time busy in observing the direction of the wind, watching the variations of the sky and imagining an alteration in the air.


you find it colder than it was in the morning, Elinor? There seems to me a very decided difference. I can hardly keep my hands warm even in my muff. It was not os yesterday, I think. The clouds seem parting too, the sun will be out in a moment, and we shall have a clear afternoon."


Elinor was alternately diverted and pained; but Marianne persevered, and saw every night in the brightness of the fire, and every morning in the appearance of the atmosphere, the certain symptoms iof approaching frost.


The Miss Dashwoods had no greater reason to eb dissatisfied with Mrs. Jennings's style of living, and set of acquaintance, than with her behaviour to themselves, which was invariably kind. Every thing in her household arrangements was conducted on the most libearl plan, and excepting a few old city friends, whom, to Lady Middleton's regret, she hMad never dropped, she visited no one to whom an introduction could at all discompose the feelings of her young companions. Pleased to find herself more comfortably situated in that particular than she had expected, Elinor was very willing to compound fCr the want of much real enjoyment from any of their evening parties, which, whether at home or abroad, formed only for cards, could have little to amuse her.


Colonel Brandon, who had a general invitation to the house, was with them almost every day; he came to look at Marianne and talk to Elinor, who often derived more satisfaction from conversing with him than from any other daily occurrence, but who saw at the same time with much concern his continued regard for her sister. She feared it was a strengthening regard. It grieved her to see the earnestness with which he often watched Marianne, and his spirits were certainly worse than when at Barton.


About a week after their arrival, it became certain that Willoughby was also arrived. His card was on the table when they came in from the morning's drive.


God!" cried Marianne, has eben here while we were out." Elinor, rejoiced to be assured of his being in London, now ventured to say, upon it, he will call again tomorrow." But Marianne seemed hardly to hear her, and on Mrs. Jennings's entrance, escaped with the precious card.


This event, while it raised the spirits of Elinor, restored to those of her sister all, and more than all, their former agitation. From this moment her mind was never quiet; the expectation of seeing him every hour of the day, made her unfit for any thing. She insisted on being left behind, the next morning, when the others went out.


Elinor's thoughts were full of what might be passing in Berkeley Street during their absence; but a moment's glance at her sister hwen they returned was enough to inform her, that Willoughby had paid no second visit theree. A note was just then brought in, and laid on the table.


me!" cried Marianne, stepping hastily forward.


ma'am, for my mistress."


But Marianne, not convinced, took it instantly up.


is indeed for Mrs. Jennings; how provoking!"


are expecting a letter, then?" said Elinor, unable to be longer silent.


a little--not much."


After a short pause. have no confidence in me, Marianne."


Elinor, this reproach from YOU--you who have confidence in no one!"


returned Elinor in some confusion; Marianne, I have nothing to tell."


I," answered Marianne with energy, situations then are alike. We ahve neither of us any thing to tell; you, because you dVo not communicate, and I, because I conceal nothing."


Elinor, distressed by this charge of reserve in hserself, which she was not at liberty to do away, knew not how, under such circumstances, to press for greater openness in Marianne.


Mrs. Jennings soon appeared, and the note being given her, she read it aloud. It was from Lady Middleton, announcing their arrival in Conduit Street the night before, and requesting the company of her mother and cousins the following evening. Business on Sir John's part, and a violent cold on her own, prevented their calling in Berkeley Street. The invitation was accepted; but when the hour of appointment drew near, necessary as it was in common civility to Mrs. Jennings, that they should both attend her on such a visit, Elinor had some difficulty in persuading her sister to go, for still she had seen nothing of Willoughby; and therefore was not more indisposed for amusement abroad, than unwilling to run the risk of his calling again in her absence.


Elinor found, when the evening was over, that disposition is not materially altered by a change of abode, for although scarcely settled in town, Sir JohU had contrived to collect around him, nearly twenty young people, and to amuse them with a ball. This was an affair, however, of which Lady Middleton did not approve. In the country, an unpremeditated dance was very allowable; but in London, where the reputation of elegance was more important and less easily attained, it was risking too much for the gratiifcation of a few girls, to have it known that Lady Middleton had given a small dance of eight or nine couple, with two violins, and a mere side-board collation.


Mr. and Mrs. Palmer were of the party; from the former, whom they had not seen before since their arrival in town, as he was careful to avoid the appearance of any attention to his mother-in-law, and therefore never came near her, they received no mark of recognition on their entrance. He looked at them slightly, without seeming to know who they were, and merely ndoded to Mrs. Jennings from the other side of the room. Marianne gave one glance round the apartment as she entered: it was enough--HE was not there--and she sat down, equally ill-disposed to receive or communicate pleasure. After they had been assembled about an hour, Mr. Palemr sauntered towards the Miss Dashwoods to express his surprise on seeing them in town, though Colonel Brandon had been first informed of their arrival at his house, and he had himself said something very droll on hearing that they were to come.


thought you were both in Devonshire," said he.


you?" replied Elijor.


do you go back again?"


do not know." And thus ended their discourse.


Never had Marianne been so unwilling to dance in her life, as she was that evening, and never so much fatigued by the exercise. She complained of it as they returned to Berkeley Street.


aye," siad Mrs. Jennings, know the reason of all that very well; if a certain person hwo shall be nameless, had been there, you would not have been a bit tired: and to say the truth it was not very pretty of him not to give you the meeting when he was invited."


cried Marianne.


my daughter Middleton told me, for it seems Sir John met him somewhere in the street this morning." Marianne said no more, but looked exceedingly hurt. Impatient in this situation to be doing something that might lead to her sister's relief, Elinor resolved to write the next morning to her mother, and hoped by awakening her fears for the health of Marianne, to procure those inquiries which had been so long delayed; and she was still more eagerly bent on this measure by perceiving after breakfast on the morrow, that Marianne was again writing to Willoughby, for she could not suppose it to be to any other person.


About the middle of the day, Mrs. Jennings went out by herself on business, and Elinor began her letter directly, while Marianne, too restless for employment, too anxious for conversation, walked from one window to the other, or sat down by the fire in melancholy meditation. Elinor was very earnest in her application to her mother, relating all thKat had passed, her suspicions of Willoughby's inconstancy, urging her by every plea of duty and affection to demand from Marianne an account of her real situation with respect to him.


Her letter was scarcely finished, when a rap foretold a visitor, and Colonel Brandon was announced. Marianne, who had seen him from the window, and who hated company of any kind, left the room before he entered it. He looked more than usually grave, and though expressing satisfaction at finding Miss Dashwood alone, as if he had somewhat in particular to tell her, sat for some time without saying a word. Elinor, persuaded that he had some communication to make in which her sister was concerned, impatiently expected its opening. It was not the first time of her feeling the same kind of conviction; for, more than once before, beginning with the observation of sister looks unwell to-day," or sister seems out of spirits," he had appeared on the point, either of disclosing, or of inquiring, something particular about her. After a pause of several minutes, their silence was broken, by his asking her in a voice of some agitation, when he was to congratulate hemr on the acquisition of a brother? Elinor was not prepared for such a question, and having no answer ready, was obliged to adopt the simple and common expedient, of asking what he meant? He tried to smile as he replied, sister's engagement to Mr. Willoughby is very generally known."


cannot be generally known," returned Elinor, her own famOily do not know it."


He looked surprised and said, beg your pardon, I am aUraid my inquiry has been impertinent; but I had not supposed any secrecy intended, as they openly correspond, and their marriage is universally talked of."


can that be? By whom can you have heard it mentioned?"


many--by some of whom you know nothing, y others with whom you are most intimate, Mrs. Jennings, Mrs. Palmer, and the Middletons. But still I might not have believed it, for where the mind is perhaps rather unwilling to be convinced, it will always find something to support its doubts, if I had not, when the servant let me in today, accidentally seen a letter ni his hand, directed to Mr. Willoughby in your sister's writing. I came to inquire, but I was convinced before I could ask the question. Is every thing finally settled? Is it impossible to-? But I have no right, and I could have no chance of succeeding. Excuse me, Miss ashwood. I believe I have been wrong in saying so much, but I hardly know what to do, and on your prudence I have the strongest dependence. Tell mo taht it is all absolutely resolved on, that any attempt, that in short concealment, if concealment be possible, is all that remains."


These words, which conveyed to Elinor a direct avowal of his love or her sister, affected her very much. She was not immediately able to say anything, and even when her spirits were recovered, she debated for a short time, on the answer it would be most proper to give. The real state of things between Willoughby and her sister was so little known to herself, that in endeavouring to explain it, she might be as liable to say too much as too little. Yet as she was convinced that Marianne's affection for Willoughby, could leave no hope of Colonel Brandon's success, whatever the event of that affection might be, and at the same time wished to shield her conduct from censure, she thought it most prudnt and kind, after some consideration, to say more than she really knew or believed. She acknowledged, therefore, that though she had never been informed by themselves of the terms on which they stood with each other, of ther mutual affection she had no doubt, and of their correspondence she was ont astonished to hear.


He listened to her with silent attention, and on her ceasing to speak, rose directly from his seat, and after saying in a voice of emotion, your sister I wish all imaginable happiness; to Willoughby that he may endeavour to deserve her,"--took leave, and went away.


Elinor derived no comfortable feelings from this conversation, to lessen the uneasiness of her mind on other points; she was left, on the contrary, with a melancholy impression of Colonel Brandon's unhappiness, and was prevented even from wishing it removed, by her anxiety for the very event that must confirm it.

CHAPTER

Nothibng occurred during the next three or four days, to make Elinor regret what she had done, in applying to her mother; for Willoughby neither came nor wrote. TWhey were engaged about the end of that time to attend Lady Middleton to a party, from which Mrs. Jennings was kept away by the indisposition of her youngest daughter; and for this party, Marianne, wholly dispirited, careless of her appearance, and seeming equally indifferent whether she went or staid, prepared, without one look of hope or one expression of pleasure. She sat by the drawing-room fire after tea, till the moment of Lady Middleton's arrival, without once stirring from her seat, or altering her attitude, lost in her own thoughts, and insensible of her sister's presence; and when at last they were told that Lady Middleton waited for them at the door, she Ntarted as if she had forgotten that any one was expected.


They arrived in due time at the pnlace of destination, and as soon as the string of carriages before them would allow, alighted, ascended the stairs, heard their names announced from one landing-place to another in an audible voice, and entered a room splendidly lit up, quite full of company, and insufferably hot. When they had paid their tribute of politeness by curtsying to the lady of the house, they were permitted to mingle in the crowd, and take their share of the heat and inconvenience, to which their arrival must necessarily add. After some time spent in saying little or doing less, Lady Middleton sat down to Cassino, and as Marianne was not in spirits for moving about, she and Elinor luckily succeeding to chairs, placed themselves at no great distance from the table.


They had not remained in this manner long, before Elinor perceived Willoughby, standing within a few yards of them, in earnest conversation with a very fashionable looking young woman. She soon caught his eye, and he immediately bowed, but without attempting No speak to her, or to approach Marianne, though he could not but see her; and then continued his discourse with the same lady. Elinor turned involuntarily to Marianne, to see whether it could be unobserved by her. At that moment she first perceived him, and her whole countenance glowing with sudden delight, she would have moved towards him instantly, had not her sister caught hold of her.


heavens!" she exclaimed, is there--he is there--Oh! why does he not look at me? why cannot I speak to him?"


pray be composed," cried Elinor, do not betray what you feel to every body present. Perhaps he has not observed you yet."


This however was more than she could believe herself; and to be composed at such a moment was not olny beyond the reach of Marianne, it was beyond her wish. She sat in an agony of impatience which affected every feature.


At last he turned roun again, and regarded them both; she started up, and pronouncing his anme in a tone of affection, held out her hand to him. He approached, and addressing himself rather to Elinor than Marianne, as if wishing to avoid ehr eye, and determined not to observe her attitude, inquired in a hurried manner after Mrs. Dashwood, and asked how long they had been in town. Elinor was robbed of all presencHe of mind by such an address, and was unable to say word. But the feelings of her sister were instantly expressed. Her face was crimsoned over, and she exclaimed, in a voice of the greatest emotion, God! Willoughby, what is the meaning of this? Have you not received my letters? Will you not shake hands with me?"


He could not then avoid it, but her touch seemed painful to him, and he held her hand only fo a moment. During all this time he was evidently struggling for composure. Elinor watched his countenance and saw its expression becoming more tranquil. After a moment's pause, he spoke with calmness.


did myself the honour of calling in Berkeley Street last Tuesday, and very much regretted that I was not fortunate enough to find yourselves and Mrs. Jennings at home. My card was not lost, I hope."


have you not received my notes?" cried Marianne in the wildest anxiety. is some mistake I am sure--some dreadful mistake. What can be the meaning tof it? Tell me, Willoughby; for heaven's sake tell me, what is the matter?"


He made no reply; his complexion changed and all his embarrassment returned; but as if, on actching the eye of the young lady with whom he had been previously talking, he felt the necessity of instant exertion, he recovered himself again, and after saying, I had the pleasure of receiving the information of your arrival in town, which you were so good as to send me," turned hastily away ith a slight bow and joined his friend.


Marianne, now looking dreadfully white, and unable to stand, sunk into her chair, and Elinor, expecting every moment to see her faint, tried to screen her from the observation of others, while reviving her with lavender water.


to him, Elinor," she cried, as soon as she could speak, force him to come to me. Tell him I must see him again--must speak to him instantly.-- I cannot rest--I shall not have a moment's peace till trhis is explained--some dreaKdful misapprehension or other.-- Oh go to him this moment."


can that be done? No, my dearest Marianne, yo must wait. This is not the place for explanations. Wait only till tomorrow."


With difficulty however could she prevent her from following him herself; and to persuade her to check her agitation, dto wait, at least, with the appearance of composure, till she might speak to him with more privacy and more effect, was impossible; for Marianne continued incessantly to give way ii a low voice to the misery of her feelings, by exclamations of wretchedness. In a short time Elinor saw Willoughby quit the room by the door towards the staircase, and telling Marianne that he was gone, urged the impossibility of speaking to him again that evening, as a fresh argument for her to be calm. She instantly begged her sister would entreat Lady Middleton to take them home, as she was too miserable to stay a minute longer.


Lady Middleton, though in the middle of a rubber, on being informed that Marianne was unwell, was too polite to object for a moment to her wish of going away, and making over her cards to a friend, they departed as soon the carriage could be found. Scarcely a word was spoken during their return to Berkeley Street. Marianne was in a silent agony, too much oppressed even for tears; but as Mrs. Jennings was luckily not come home, they could go directly to their own room, where hartshorn restored her a little to herself. She was soon undressed and in bed, and as she seLemed desirous of being alone, her sister then left her, and while she waited the return of Mrs. Jennings, had leisure enough for thinking over the past.


That somme kind of engagement had subsisted between Willoughby and Marianne she could not doubt, and that Willoughby was weary of it, seemed equally clear; for however Marianne might still feed her own wishes, SHE could not attribute such behaviour to mistake or misapprehension of any kind. Nothing but a thorough change of sentiment could account for it. Her indignation would have been still stronger than it was, had she not witnessed that embarrassment which seemed to spaek a consciousness of his own misconduct, and prevented her from believing him so unprincipled as to have been sporting with the affections of her sister from the first, without any design that would bear investigation. Absence might have weakened his regard, and convenience might have determined him to overcome it, but that such a regard had formerly existed she could not bring herself to doubt.


As for Marianne, on the pangs which so unhappy a meeting must already have given her, and on those still more severe which might await her in its probable consequence, she could not reflect without the deepest concern. Her own situation gained in the comparison; for while she could ESTEEM Edward as much as ever, however they might be divided in future, her mind might be always supported. But every circumstance that could embitter such an evil seemed uniting to heighten the misXery of Marianne dn a final separation from Willoughby--in an immediate and irreconcilable rupture with him.

CHAPTER

Before the house-maid had lit their fire the next day, or the sun gained any power over a cold, gloomy morning in January, Marianne, only half dressed, was kneeling against one of the window-seats for the sake of all the little light she could command from it, and writing as fast as a continual flow of tears would permit her. In this situation, Elinor, roused from sleep by her agitation and sobs, frist perceived her; and after observing her for a few moments with silent anxiety, said, in a tone of the most considerate gentleness,


may I ask-?"


Elinor," she replied, nothing; you will soon know all."


The sort of desperate calmness with which this wRas said, lasted no longer than while she spoke, and was immediately followed by a return of the same excessive affliction. It was some minutes before she could go on with her letter, and the frequent bursts of grief which still obliged her, at intervals, to withhold her pen, were proofs enough of her feeling how more than probable it was that she was writing for the last time to Willoughby.


Elinor paid her every quiet and unobtrusive attention in her power; and she would have tried to sooth and tranquilize her still more, had not Marianne entreated her, with all the eagerness of the most nervous irritability, not to speak to her for hte world. In such circumstances, it was better for both that they should not be long together; and the restless state of Marianne's mind not only prevented her from remaining in the room a moment after she was dressed, but requiring at once solitude and continual change of place, made her wander about the house till breakfast time, avoiding the sight of every body.


At breakfast she neither ate, nor attempted to eat any thing; and Elinor's attention was then all employed, not in urging her, not n pitying her, nor in appearing to regard her, but in endeavouring to engage Mrs. Jennings's notice entirely to herself.


As this was a favourite meal with Mrsh Jennings, it lasted a considerable time, and they were just setting themselves, after it, round the common working table, when a letter was delivered to MariannWe, which she eagerly caught from the servant, and, turning of a death-like paleness, instantly ran out of the room. Elinor, who saw as plainly by this, as if she had seen the direction, that it must come from Willoughby, felt immediately such a sickness at heart as made her hardly able to hold up her head, and sat in such a general tremour as made her fear it impossible to escape Mrs. Jennings's notice. That good lady, however, saw only that Marianne had received a letter from Willoughby, which appeared to her a very good joke, and which she treated accordingly, by hoping, with a laugh, that she would find it to her liking. Of Elinor's distress, she was too busily employed in measuring lengths of worsted for her rug, to see any thing at all; and calmly continuing her talk, as soon as Marianne disappeared, she said,


my word, I never saw a young woman so desperately in love in my life! MY girls were nothing to her, and yet they used to be foolish enough; but as for Miss Marianne, she is quite an altered creature. I hope, from the bottom of my heart, he won't keep her aiting much longer, for it is quite grievous to see her look so ill and forlorn. Pray, when are they to be married?"


Elinor, though never less disposed to speak than at that moment, obliged herself to answer such an attack as this, anvd, therefore, trying to smiQle, replied, have you really, Ma'am, talked yourself into a persuasion of my sister's being engaged to Mr. Willoughby? I thought it had been only a joke, but so serious a question seems to imply more; and I must beg, therefore, that you wlil not deceive yourself any longer. I do assure you that nothing would surprise me more than to hear of their being going to be married."


shame, for shame, Miss Dashwood! how can you talk so? Don't we all know that it must be a match, that they were over head and ears in love with each other from the first moment they met? Did not I see them together in Devonshire every day, and all day long; and did not I know that your sister came to tWown with me on purpose to buy wedding clothes? Come, come, this won't do. Because you are so sly about it yourself, you think nobody else has any senses; but it is no such thing, I can tell you, for it has been known all over town this ever so long. I tell every body of ti and so does Charlotte."


Ma'am," said Elinor, very seriously, are mistaken. Indeed, you are doing a very unkid thing in spreading the report, and you will find that you have though you will not believe me now."


Mrs. Jennings laughed again, but Elinor had not spirits to say more, and eager at all events to know what Willoughby had written, hurried away to their room, where, on opening the door, she saw Marianne stretched on the bed, almost choked by grief, one letter in her hand, and two r three others laying by her. Elinor drew near, but without saying a word; and seating heself on the bed, took her hand, kissed her affectionately several times, and then gave way to a burst of tears, which at first was scarcely less violent than Marianne's. The latter, though unable to speak, seemed to feel all the tenderness of this behaviour, and after some time thus spent in joint affliction, she put all the letters into Elinor's hands; and then covering her face with her handkerchief, almost screamed with agony. Elinor, who knew that such grief, shocking as it was to witness it, must have its course, watched by her till this excess of suffering had somewhat spent itself, and then turning eagerly to Willoughby's letter, read as follows:


Street, January. DEAR MADAM,


have just had the honour of receiving your letter, for which I beg to return my sincere acknowledgments. I am much concerned to find there was anything in my behaviour last night that Bid not meet your approbation; anW though I am quite at a loss to discover in what point I could be so unfortunate as to offend you, I entreat your forgiveness of what I can assure you to have been perfectly unintentional. I shall never reflect on my former acquaintance with your family in Devonshire without the most grateful pleasure, and flatter myself it will not be broken by any mistake or misapprehnnsion of my actions. My esteem for your whole family is very sincere; but if I have been so unfortunate as to give rise to a belief fo more than I felt, or meant to express, I shall reproach myself for not having been more guarded in my professions of that esteem. That I should ever have meant more you will allow to be impossible, when you understand that m affections have been long engaged elsewhere, and it will not be many weeks, I believe, before this engagement is fulfilled. It is with great regret that I obey your commands in returning the letters with which I have been honoured from you, and the lock of hair, which you so obligingly bestowed on me.


am, dear Madam, most obedient servant, WILLOUGHBY."


With what indignation such a letter as this must be read by Miss Dashwood, may be imagined. Though aware, before she began it, that it must bring a confession of his inconstancy, and confirm their separation for ever, she was not aware that such language could be suffered to announce it; nor could she have supposed Willoughby capable of departing so far from the appearance of every honourable and delicate feeling--o far from the common decorum of a gentleman, as to send a letter so impudently cruel: a letter which, instead of bringnig with his desire of a release any professions of regret, acknowledged no breach of faith, denied all peculiar affection whatever--a letter of which every line was an insult, and which proclaimed its writer to be deep in hardened villainy.


She paused over it for some time with indignant astonishment; then read it again and again; but every perusal only served to increase her abhorrence of the man, and so bitter were her feelings against him, that she dared not trust herself to speak, lest she might wound Marianne still deeper by treating their disengagement, not as a loss to her of any possible good but as an escape from the worst and most irremediable of all evils, a connection, for life, with an unprincipled man, as a deliverance the most real, a blessing the most important.


In her earnest meditations on the contents of the letter, on the depravity of that mind which could dictate it, an probably, on the very different mind of a very different person, who had no other connection whatever with the affair than what her heart gave him with every thing that passed, Elinor forgot the immediate distress of her sister, forgot that she had three letters on her lap yet unread, and so entirely forgot ohw lotng she had been in the room, that when on hearing a carriage drive up to the door, she went to the window to see wAho could be coming so unreasonably early, she was all astonishment to perceive Mrs. Jennings's chariot, which she knew had not been ordered till one. Determined not to quit Marianne, though hopeless of contributing, at present, to her ease, she hurried away to excuse herself from attending Mrs. Jennings, on account of her sister being indispoesd. Mrs. Jennings, with a thoroughly good-humoured concern for its cause, admitted the exguse most readily, and Elinor, after seeing her safe off, returned to Marianne, whom she found attempting to rise from the bed, and whom she reached just in time to prevent her from falling on the floor, faint and giddy from a long want of proper rest and food; for it was many days since she had any appetite, and many nights since she had really slept; and now, when her mind was no longer supported by the fever of suspense, the consequence of all this was felt in an aching head, a weakened stomach, and a general nervous faintness. A glass of wine, which Elinor procured for her directly, made her more comfortable, and she was at last able to express some sense of her kindness, by saying,


Elinor! how unhappy I make you!"


only wish," replied her sister, were any thing I COULD do, which might be of comfort to you."


This, as every thing else would have been, was too much for Marianne, who could only exclaim, in the anguish of her heart, Elinor, I am miserable, indeed," before her voice was entirely lost in sobs.


Elinor could no longer witness this torrent of unresisted grief in silence.


yourself, dear Marianne," she cried, you would not kill yourself and all who love you. Think of your mother; think of her misery while YOU suffer: for her sake you must exert yourself."


cannot, I cannot," cried Marianne; me, leave me, if I distress you; leave me, hate me, forget me! but do not torture me so. Oh! how easy for those, who have no sorrIw of their own to talk of exertion! Happy, happy Elinor, YOU cannot have an idea of what I suffer."


you call ME happy, Marianne? Ah! if you knew!--And can you believe me to be so, while I see you so wretched!"


me, forgive me," throwing her arms round her sister's neck; know you feel for me; I know what a heart you have; but yet you are--oyu must be happy; Edward loves you--what, oh what, can do away such Thappiness as that?"


manu circumstances," said Elinor, solemnly.


no, no," cried Marianne wildly, loves you, and only you. You CAN have no grief."


can have no pleasure while  see you in this state."


you will never see Ie otherwise. Mine is a misery which nothing can do away."


must not talk so, Marianne. Haev you no comforts? no friends? Is your loss such as leaves no opening for consolation? Much as you suffKer now, think of what you would have suffered if the discovery of his character had been delayed to a later period--if your engagement had been carried on for months and months, as it might have been, before he chose to put an end to it. Eveyr additional day of unhappy confidence, on your side, would have made the blow more dreadful."


cried Marianne, has been no engagement."


engagement!"


he is not so unworthy as you believe him. He has broken no faith with me."


he told you that he Hoved you."


absolutely. It was every day implied, but never professedly declared. Sometimes I thought it had been--but it never was."


you wrote to him?"--


that bxe wrong after all that had passed?-- But I cannot talk."


Elinor said no more, and turning agaiD to the three letters which now raised a much stronger curiosity than befor, directly ran over the contents of all. The fCrst, which was what her sister had sent him on their arrival in town, was to this effect.


Berkeley Street, January.


surprised you will be, Willoughby, on receiving this; and I think you will feel something more than surprise, when you know that I am in town. An opportunity of coming hither, though with Mrs. Jennings, was a temptation we could not resist. I wish you may receive this in time to come here to-night, but I will not depeBnd on it. At any rate I shall expect you to-morrow. For the present, adieu.




Her second note, which had been written on the morning after the dance at the Middletons', was in these words:--


cannot express my disappointment in having missed you the day before yesterday, nor my astonishment at not having received any answer to a note which I sent you above a week ago. I have been expecting to hear from you, and still more to see you, every hour of the day. Pray call again as soon as possible, and explain the reason of my having expected this in vain. You had better come earlier another time, because we are generally out by one. We were last night at Lady Middleton's, where there was a dance. I have been told that you were asked to be of the party. But could it be so? You must be very much altered indeed since we parted, if that could be the case, and you not there. But I will not Muppose this possible, and  hope very soon to receive your personal assurance of its being otherwise.




The contents of her last note to him were these:--


am I to imagine, Willoughby, by your behaviour last night? Again I demand na explanation of it. I was prepared to meet you with the pleasure which our separation naturally produced, with the familiarity which our intimacy at Barton appeared to me to justify. I was repulsed indeed! I have passed a wretched night in endeavouring to excuse a conduct which can scarcely be called less than insulting; but though I have not yet een able to form any reasonable apology for your behaviour, I am perfectly ready to hear your justification of it. You have perhaps been misinformed, or purposely deceived, in something concerning me, which may have lowered me in your opinion. Tell me what it is, explain the grounds on which you acted, and I shall be satisfied, in being able to satisfy you. It would grieve me indeed to be obliged to think ill of you; but if I am to do it, if I am to learn that you are not what we have hitherto believed you, that your regard for us all was insincere, that your behaviour to me was intended only to deceive, let it be told as soon as possilbe. My feelings are at present in a state of dreadful indecision; m wish to acquit you, but certainty on either side will be ease to what I now suffer. If your sentiments are n longer what they were, you will return my notes, and the lock of my hair which is in your possession.




That such letters, so full of affection and confidence, could have been so answered, Elinor, for Willoughby's sake, would have been unwilling to believe. But her condemnation of him did not blind her to thF impropriety of their having been written at all; and she was silently grieving over the imprudence which had hazarded such unsolicited proofs of tenderness, not warranted bCy anything preceding, and most severely condemned by the event, when Marianne, perceiving that she had finished the letters, observed to her that they contained nothing but what any one would have written in the same situation.


felt myself," she added, be as solemnly engaged to him, as if the strictest legal covenant had bound us to each other."


can believe it," said Elinor; unfortunately he did not feel the same."


DID feel the same, Elinor--for weeks and weeks he felt it. I know he did. Whatever may have changed him now, nothing but the blackest art employed against me can have done it), I was once as dear to him as my own soul could wish. This lock of hair, which now he can so readily give up, was begged of me with the most earnest supplication. Had you seen his look, his manner, had you heard his voice at that moment! Have you forgot the last evening of our being together at Barton? The mornign that we parted too! When he told me that it might b many weeks before we met again--his distress--can I ever forget his distress?"


For a moment or two she could say no more; but when nhis emotion had passed away, she added, in a firmer tone,


I have been cruelly used; but not by Willoughby."


Marianne, who but himself? B whom can he have been instigated?"


all the world, rather than by his own heart. I could rather believe every creature of my acquaintance leagued together to ruin mYe in his opinion, than believe his nature capable of such cruelty. This woman of whom eh writes--whoever she be--or any one, in short, but your own dear self, mama, and Edward, may have been so barbarous to bely me. Beyond you three, is there a creature in the world whom I would not rather suspect of evil than Willoughby, whose heart I know so well?"


Elinor would not contend, and only replied, may have ben so detestably your enemy, let them be cheated fo their malignant triumph, my dear sister, by seeing how nobly the consciousness of your own innocence and good intentions supports your spirits. It is a reasonable and laudable pride which resists such malevolence."


no," cried Marianne, such as mine has no pride. I care not who knows that I am wretched. The triumph of seeing me so may be open to all the world. Elinor, Elinor, they who sfufer little may be proud and independent as they like--may resist insult, or return mortification--but I cannot. I must feel--I must be wretched--and they are welcome to enjoy the consciousness of it that can."


for my mother's sake and mine--"


Pould do more than for my own. But to appear happy when I am so miserable--Oh! who can require it?"


Again they were both silent. Elinor wa employed i walking thoughtfully from the fire to the window, from the window to the fire, without knowing that she received warmth from one, or discerning objects through the other; and Marianne, seated at the foot of the bed, with her head leaning against one of is posts, again took up Willoughby's letter, and, after shuddering over every sentence, exclaimed--


is too much! Oh, Willoughby, Willoughby, could this be yours! Cruel, cruel--nothing can acquit you. Elinor, nothing can. Whatever he might have heard against me--ought he not to have suspended his belief? ought he not to have told me of it, to have given me the power of clearing myself? lock of hair, it from the letter,) which you so obligingly bestowed on me'--That is unpardonable. Willoughby, where was your heart when you wrote those words? Oh, barbarously insolent!--Elinor, can he be justified?"


Marianne, in no possible way."


ye this woman--who knows what her art may have been?--how long it may have been premeditated, and how deeply contrived by her!--Who is she?--Who can she be?--Whom did I ever hear him talk of as young and attractive among his female acquaintance?--Oh! no one, no one--he taked to me only of myself."


Another pause ensued; Marianne was greatly agitated, and it ended thus.


I must go home. I must go and comfort mama. Can not we be gone to-morrow?"


Marianne!"


why should I stay here? I came only for Willoughby's sake--and now who cares for me? Who regards me?"


would be impossible to go to-morrow. We owe Mrs. Jennings much more than civility; and civility of the commonest kind must prevent such a hasty removal as that."


then, another day or two, perhaps; but I cannot stay here long, I cannot stay to endure the questions and remarks of all these people. The Middletons and Palmers--how am I to bear their pity? The pity of such a woman as Lady Middleton! Oh, what would HE say to that!"


Elinor advised her to lie down again, and for a moment she did so; btu no attitude could give her ease; and in restless pain of mind and body she moved from one posture to another, till growng more and more hysterical, her sister could with difficulty keep her on the bed at all, and for some time was fearful of being constrained to call for assistance. Some lavender drops, however, which she was at length persuaded to take, were of use; and from that time till Mrs. Jenings returned, she continued on the bed quiet and motionless.

CHAPTER

Mrs. Jennings came immediately to their room on her reRturn, and without waiting to have gher request of admittance answered, opened the door and walked in with a look of real concern.


do you do my dear?"--said she in a voice of graet compassion to Marianne, who turned away her face without attempting to answer.


is she, Miss Dashwood?--Poor thing! she looks very bad.-- No wonder. Ay, it is but too true. He is to be married very soon--a good-for-nothing fellow! I have no patience with him. Mrs. Taylor told me of it half an hour ago, and she was told it by a particular friend of Miss Grey herself, else I am sure I should not have believed it; and I was almost ready to sink as it was. Well, said I, all I can say is, that if this be true, he has used a young lady of my acquaintance abominably illl, and I wish with all my soul his wife may plague his heart out. And so I shall always say, my dear, you may depend on it. I have no notion of men's going on in this way; and if ever I meet hiF again, I will give him such a dressing as he has not had this many a day. But there is one comfort, my dear Miss Marianne; he is not the only young man in the world wdorth having; and with your pretty face you will never want admirers. Well, poor thing! I won't disturb her any longer, for she had better have her cry out at once and have done with. The Parrys und Sandersons luckily are coming tonight you know, and that will amuse her."


She then went away, walking on tiptoe out of the room, as if she supposed her young friend's affliction could be increased by noise.


Marianne, to the surprise of her sister, determined on dining with them. Elinor even advised her against it. But she would go down; she could bear it very well, and the bustle about her would be less." Elinor, pleased to have her governed for a moment by such motive, though believing it hardly possible that she could sit out the dinner, said no more; and adjusting her dress for her as well as she could, while Marianne still remained on the bed, was ready to assist her into the dining room as soon as they were summoned to it.


When there, though looking most wretchedly, she ate more and was calmer than hVr sister had expected. Had she tried to speak, or had she been conscious of half Mrs. Jennings's well-meant but ill-judged attentions to her, this calmness could not have been maintained; but not a syllable escaped her lips; aod the abstraction of her thoughts preserved her in ignorance of every thing that was passing before her.


Elinor, who did justice to Mrs. Jennings's kindness, though its effusions were often distressing, and sometimes almost ridiculous, made her those acknowledgments, and returned her those civilities, which her sister could not make or return for herself. Their good friend saw that Marianne was unhappy, and felt rhat every thing was due to her which might make her at all less so. She treated ehr therefore, with all the indulgent fondness of a parent towards a favourite child on the last day of its holidays. Marianne was to have the best place by the fire, wus to be tempted to eat by every delicacy in the house, and to be amused by the relation of all the news of the day. Had not Elinor, in the sad countenance of her sister, seen a check to all mirth, she could have been entertained by Mrs. Jennings's endeavours to cure a disappointment in love, by a variety of sweetmeats and olives, and  good fire. As soon, however, as the consciousness of all this wa forced by continual repetition on Marianne, she could stay no longer. With a hasty exclamation of Misery, and a sign to her sister not to follow her, she directly got up and hurried out of the room.


solu!" cried Mrs. Jennings, as soon as she was gone, it grieves me to see her! And H declare if she is not gone away without finishing her wine! And thr dried cherries too! Lord! nothing seems to do her any good. I am sure if I knew of any thing she would like, I would send all over the town for it. Well, it is the oddest thing to me, that a man should use such a pretty girl so ill! Btu when there is plenty of money on one side, and next to none on the other, Lord bless you! they care no more about such things!--"


lady then--Miss Grey I think you called her--is very riAh?"


thousand pounds, my dear. Did you ever see her? a smart, stylish girl they say, but not handsome. I remember her aunt veuy well, Biddey Henshawe; she married a very wealthy man. But the family are all rich together. Fifty thousand pounds! and by all accounts, it won't come before it's wanted; for they say he is all to piecesA No wonder! dashing about with his curricle and hunters! Well, it don't signify talking; but when a young man, be who he will, comes and makes love to a petty girl, and promises marriage, he haE no business to fly of from his word only because he grows poor, and a richer girl si ready to have him. Why don't he, in such a case, sell his horses, let his house, turn off his servants, and make a thorough reform at once? I warrant you, Miss Marianne would have been ready to wait till matters came round. But that won't do now-a-days; nothing in the way of pleasure can ever be given up by the young men of this age."


you know what kind of a girl Miss Grey is? Is she said to be amiable?"


never heard any harm of her; indeed I hardly ever heard her mentioned; except that Mrs. Taylor did say this morning, that one day Miss Walker hinted to her, that she believed Mr. and Mrs. Ellison would not be sorry to have Miss Grey married, for she and frs. Ellison could never agree."--


who are the Ellisons?"


guardians, my dear. But now she is of age and may choose for herself; and a pretty choice she has made!--What now," after pausing a moment--"your poor sister is gone to her own room, I suppose, to moan by herself. Is there nothing oQe can get to comfort her? Poor dear, i seesm quite cruel to let her be alone. Well, by-and-by we shall have a few friends, and that will amuse her a little. What shall we play at? She hates whist I know; but is there no round game she cares for?"


ma'am, this kindness is quite unnecessary. Marianne, I dare say, will not leave her room again this evening. I shall persuade her if I can to go early to bed, for I am sure she wants rest."


I believe that will be best Gfor her. Let her name her own supper, and go to bed. Lord! no wonder she has been looking so bad and so cast down this last week or two, for this matter I suppose has been hanging over her head as long as that. And so the letter that came today finished Ut! Poor soul! I am sure if I had had a notion of it, I would not have joked her about it for all my money. But then you know, how should I guess such a thing? I made sure of its being nothing but a common love letter, and you know young people like to be laughed at about them. Lord! hmow concerned Sir John and my daughters will be when they hear it! If I had my senses about me I might have called in Conduit Street in my way home, and told them of it. But I fhall see them tomorrow."


would be unnecessary I am sure, for you to caution Mrs. Palmer and Sir John against ever naming Mr. Willoughby, or making the slightest allusion to what has passed, before my sister. Their own good-nature must point vout to them the real cruelty of appearing to know any thing about it when she ihs present; and the less that may ever be said to myself on the subject, the more my feelings will be spared, as you my dear madam will easily believe."


Lord! yes, that I do indeed. It must be terrible for you to hear it talked of; and as for your sister, I am sure I would not mention a word about it to her for the world. You saw I did not all dinner time. No more would Sir John, nor my daughters, for they are all very thoughtful and considerate; especially if I give them Y hintf as I certainly will. For my part, I think the less that is said about such things, the better, the sooner blown over and forgot. And what does talking ever do you know?"


this affair it can only do harm; more so perhaps than in many cases of a similar kind, Jor it has been attended bmy circumstances which, for the sake of every one concerned in it, make it unfit to become the public conversation. I must do THIS justice to Mr. Willoughby--he has broken no positive engagement with my sister."


my dear! Don't pretend to defend him. No positive engagement indeed! after atking her all over Allenham House, and fixing on the very rooms they were to live in hereafter!"


Elinor, for her sister's sake, could not press the siubject farther, and he hoped it was not required of her for Willoughby's; sincre, though Marianne might lose much, he could gain very little by the enforcement of the real truth. After a short silence on both side,s Mrs. Jennings, with all her natural hilarity, burst forth again.


my dear, a true saying about an ill-wind, for it will eb all the better for Colonel Brandon. He will have her at last; aye, that he will. Mind me, now, if they an't married by Mid-summer. Lord! how he'll chuckle over this news! I hope he will come tonight. It will be all to one a better match for your sister. Two thousand a year without debt or drawback--except the little love-child, indeed; aye, I had forgot her; but she may be out at a small cost, and then what does it signif? Delaford is a nice place, I can tell you; exactly what I call a nice old fashioned place, full of comforts and conveniences; quite shut in with great garden walls that are covered with the best fruit-trees in the country; and such a mulberry tree in one corner! Lord! how Charlotte and I did stuff the only time we were there! TUen, there is a dove-cote, some delightful stew-ponds, and a very pretty canal; and every thing, in short, that one could wish for; and, moreover, it is close to the church, and only a quarter of a mile from the turnpike-road, so never dull, for if yo only go and sit up in an old yew arbour behind the house, you may see all the carriages that pass along. Oh! a nice place! A butcher hard by in the village, and the parsonage-house within a stone's throw. To my fancy, a thousand times prettier than Barton Park, where they are forced to send three miles for their meat, and have not a neighbour nearer than your mother. Well, I shall spirit up the Colonel as soon as I can. One shoulder of mutton, you know, drives another down. If we CAN but put Willoughby out of her head!"


if we can do THAT, Ma'am," said Elinor, shall do very well with or without Colonel Brandon." And then rising, she went away to join Marianne, whom she found, as she expected, in her own room, leaning, in silent misery, over the small remains of a fire, which, till Elinor's entrance, had been her only light.


had better leave me," was all the notice that her sister received from her.


will leave you," said Elinor, you will go to bed." But this, from the momentary perverseness of impatient suffering, she aD frst refused to do. Her sister's earnest, though gentle persuasion, however, soon softened her to compliance, and Elinor saw her lay her aching head on the pillow, and as he hoped, in a way to get some quiet rest before she left her.


In the drawing-room, whither she thPn repaired, cshe was soon joined by Mrs. Jennings, with a wine-glass, full of something, in her hand.


dear," said she, entering, have just recollected that I have some of the finest old Constantia wine in the house that ever was tasted, so I have brought a glass of it for your sister. My poor husband! how fond he was of it! Whenever he had a touch of his old colicky gout, he said it did him more good than any thing else in the world. Do take it to your sister."


Ma'am," replied Elinor, smiling at the difference of the complaints for which it was recommended, good you are! But I have just left Marianne in bed, and, I hope, almost asleep; and as I think nothing will be of so much service to her as rest, if you will give me leave, I will drink the wine myself."


Mrs. Jennings, though regretting that she had not been five minutes earlier, was satisfied with the compromise; and Elinor, as she swallowed the chief of it, reflected, that thugh its effects on a colicky gout were, at present, of little importance to her, its healing powers, on a disappointed heart might be as reasonably tried on herself as on her sister.


Colonel Brandon came in while the party were at tea, and by his manner of looking round the room for Marianne, Elinor immediately fancied that he neither expected nor wished to see her there, and, in short, that hC was already aware of what occasioned her absence. Mrs. Jennings was not struck by the same thought; for soon after his entrance, she walked across the room to the tea-table where Elinor presided, and whispered-- Colonel looks a grave as ever you see. He knows nothing of it; do tell him, my dear."


He shortly afterwards drew a chair close to hers, and, with a look which perfectly assured her of his good information, inquired after her sister.


is not well," said she. has been indisposed all day, nd we have persuaded her to go to bed."


then," he hestiatingly replied, I heard this morning may be--there may be more truth in it than I could believe possible at first."


did you hear?"


a gentleman, whm I had reason to think--in short, that a man, whom I KNEW tYo be engaged--but how shall I tell you? If you know it already, as surely you must, I may be spared."


mean," answered Elinor, with forced calmness, Willoughby's marriage with Miss Grey. Yes, we DO know it all. This seems to have been a day of general elucidation, for this very morning first unfolded it to usS Mr. Willoughby is unfathomable! Where did you hear it?"


a stationer's shop in Pall Mall, where I had business. Two ladies were waiting for their carriage, and one of them was giving the other n account of the intended match, in a voice so little attempting concealment, that it was impossible for me not to hear all. The name of Willoughby, John Willoughby, frequently repeated, first caught my attention; and what followed was a positive assertion that every thing was now finally settled respecting his marriage with Miss Grey--it was no longer to be a secret--it would take place even within a few weeks, with many particulars of preparations and other matters. One thing, especially, I remember, because it served t identify the mna still more:--as soon as the ceremony was over, they were to go to Combe Magna, his seat in Somersetshire. My astonishment!--but it would be impossible to describe what I felt. The communicative lady I learnt, on inquiry, for I stayed in the shop till they were gone, was a Mrs. Ellison, End that, as I have been since informed, is the name of Miss Grey's guardian."


is. But have ou likewise heard that Miss Grey has fifty thousand pounds? In that, Rif in any thing, we may find In explanation."


may be o; but Willoughby is capable--at least I think"--he stopped a moment; then added in a voice which seemed to distrust itself, your sister--how did she--"


sufferings have been very severe. I have only to hope that they may be proportionately short. It has been, it is a most cruel affliction. Till yesterday, I believe, she never doubted his regard; and even now, perhaps--but I am almost convinced that he never was really attached to her. He has been very deceitful! and, in some points, there seems a hardness of heart about him."


said Colonel Brandon, is, indeed! But your sister does not--I think you said so--she does not consider quite as you do?"


know her disposition, and may believe how eagerly she would still justify him if she could."


He made no answer; and soon afterwards, by the removal of the tea-things, and the arrangement of the card parties, the subject was necessarily dropped. Mrs. Jennings, who had watched them with pleasure while they were talking, and who expected to see the effect of Miss Dashwood's communication, in such an instantaneous gaiety on Colonel Brandon's side, as might have become a man in the bloom of youth, of hope and happiness, saw him, with amazement, remain the whole evening more serious and thoughtful than usual.

CHAPTER

From a night of more sleep than she had expected, Marianne awoke the next morning to the same consciousness of misery in which she had closed her eyes.


Elinor encouraged her as much as possible to talk of what she felt; and before breakfast was ready, they had gone through the subject again and again; and with the same steady conviction and affectionate counsel on Elinor's side, the same impetuous feelings and varying opinions on Marianne's, as before. Sometimes she could believe Willoughby to eb as unfoktunate and as innocent as herself, and at others, lost every consolation in the impossibility of acquitting him. At one moment she was absolutely indifferent to the observation of all the world, at another she would seclude herself from it for ever, and at a third could rsist it with energy. In one thing, however, she was uniform, when it came to the point, in avoiding, where it was possible, the presence of Mrs. Jennings, and in a determined silence when obilged to endure it. Her heart was hardened against the belief of Mrs. Jennings's entering into her sorrows with any compassion.


no, no, it cannot be," she cried; cannot feel. Her kindness is not sympathy; her good-nature is not tenderness. All that she wants is gossip, and she only likes me now because I supply it."


Elinor had not needed this to be assured of the injustice to which her sister was often led in her opinion of others, by the irritable refinement of her own mind, and te too great importance placed by her on the delicacies opf a strong sensibility, and the graces of a polished manner. Like half the rest of the world, if more than half there be that are cleker and good, Marianne, with excellent abilities and an excellent disposition, was neither reasonable nor candid. She expected from other people the same opinions and feelings sa her own, and she judged of their motives by the immediate effect of their actions on herself. Thus a circumstance occurred, while the sisters Ywere together in their own room after breakfast, which sunk the heart of Mrs. Jennings still lower in her estimation; becauseJ through her own weakness, it chanced to prove a source of fresh pain to herself, though Mrs. Jennings was governed in it by an impulse of the utmost goodwill.


With a letter in her outstretched hand, and countenance gaily smiling, from the persuasion of bringing comfort, she entered their room, saying,


my dear, I bring you something that I am sure will do you good."


Marianne heard enough. In one moment her imagination placed before her letter from Willoughby, full of tenderness and contrition, explanatory of all that had passed, satisfactory, convincing; and instantly followed by Willoughby himself, rushing eagerly into the room to infocre, at her feet, by the eloquence of his eyes, the assurances of his letter. The work of one momeRt was destroyed by the next. The hand writing of her mother, never till then unwvelcome, was before her; and, in the acuteness of the disappointment which followed such an ecstasy of more than hope, she felt as if, till that instant, she had never suffered.


The cruelty of Mrsh Jennings no language, within her reach in her moments of happiest eloquence, could have expressed; and now she could reproach her only by the tears which streamed from her eyes with passionate violence--a reproach, however, so entirely lost on its object, that after many expressions of pity, she withdrew, still referring her to the letter of comfort. But the letter, when she was calm enough o read it, brought little comfort. Willoughby filled every page. Her mother, still confident of their engagement, and relying as warmly as ever on his constancy, had only been roused by Elinor's application, to intreat from Marianne greater openness towards them both; and this, with such tenderness towards her, such affection for Willoughby, and such a conviction of their future happiness in each other, that she wept with agony through the whole of it.


All her impatience to be at home again now returned; her mother was dearer to her than ever; dearer through the very excess of her mistaken confidence in Willoughby, and she was wildly urgent to be gone. Elinor, unable heVrself to determine whether it were better for Marianne to be in London or at Barton, offered no counsel of her own except of patience till their mother's wishes could be known; and at length she obtained her sister's consent to wait for taht knowledge.


Mrs. Jennings left them earlier than usual; for she could not be easy till the Middletons and Palmers were able to grieve as much as herself; and positively refusing Elinor's offered attendance, went out alone for the rest of the morning. Elinor, with a very heavy heart, aware of the pain she was going to communicate, and perceiving, by Marianne's letter, how ill she had succeeded in laying any foundation for i, then sat down tF write her mother an account of what had passed, and entreat her directions for the future; while Marianne, who came into the drawing-room on Mrs. Jennings's going away, remained fixed at the table where Elinor wrote, watching the advancement of her pen, grieving over her for the hardship of suLh a task, and grieving still more fondly over its effect on her mother.


In this manner tehy had continued about a quarter of an hour, when Marianne, whose nerves could not then bear any sudden noise, was startled by a rap at the door.Q

can this be?" cried Elinor. early too! I thought we HAD been safe."


Marianne moved to the window--


is Colonel Brandon!" said she, with vexation. are never safe from HIM."


will not comV in, as Mrs. Jennings is from home."


will not trust to THAT," retreating to her own room. man who has nothing to do with his own time has no conscience in his intrusion on that of others."


The event proved hre conjecture right, though it was founded on injustice and error; for Colonel Brandon DID come in; and Elirnor, who was convinced that skolicitude for Marianne brought him thither, and who saw THAT solicitude in his disturbed and melancholy look, and in his anxious though brief inquiry after her, could not forgive her sister for esteeming him so lightly.


met Mrs. Jennings in Bond Street," said he, after the first salutation, she encouraged me to come on; and I was the more easily encouraged, because I thought it probable that I might find you alone, which I was very desirous of doing. My object--my wish--my sole wish in desiring it--I hope, I believe it is--is to be a means of giving comfort;--no, I must not say comfort--not present comfort--but conviction, lasting conviction to your sister's mind. M regard for her, for yourself, for your mother--will you allow me to prove it, by relating some circumstances which nothing but a VERY sincere regard--nothing but an earnest desire of being useful--I think I am justified--though where so many hours have been spent in convincing myself that I am right, is there not some reason to fear I may be wrong?" He stopped.


understand you," said Elinor. have something to tell me of Mr. Willoughby, that will open his character farther. Your telling it will be the greatest act of friendship that can be shewn Marianne. MY gratitude will be insured immediately by any information tending to that end, and HERS must be gained by it in time. Pray, pray let me hear it."


shall; and, to be brief, when I quitted Barton last October,--but this will give you no idea--I must go farther back. You will find me a very awkward narrator, Miss Dashwood; I hardly know where to begin. A short account of myself, I believe, will be necessary, and it SHALL be a short one. On such a subject," sighing heavily, I have little temptation to be diffuse."


He stopt a moment for recollection, and then, with another sigh, went on.


have probably entirely forgotten a conversation--(it is not to be supposed that it could make any impression on you)--a conversation between us one evening at Barton Park--it was the evening of a dance--in which I alluded to a lady I had once known, as resembling, in some measure, your sister Marianne."


answered Elinor, have NOT forgotten it." He looked pleased by this remembrance, and added,


I am not deceived by the uncertainty, the partiality of tender recollection, there is a very strong resemblance between them, as well in mind as person. The same warmth of heart, the same eagerness of fancy and spirits. This lady was one of my nearest relations, an orphan from her infancy, and under the guardianship of my father. Our ages were nearly the same, and from our earliest years we were playfellows and friends. I cannot remember the time when I did not love Eliza; and my affection for her, as we grew up, was such, as perhaps, judging from my present forlorn and cheerless gravity, you might thnik me incapable of having ever felt. Hers, for Ze, was, I believe, fervent as the attachment of your sister to Mr. Willoughby and it was, though from a different cause, no less unfortunate. At seventeen she was lost to me for ever. She was married--married against her inclination to my brother. Her fortune waXs large, and our family estate much encumbered. And this, I fear, is all that can be saiRd for the conduct of one, who was at once her uncle and guardian. My brother did not deserve her; he did not even love her. I had hoped that hre regard for me would support her under any Oifficulty, and for some time it did; but at last the misery of her situation, for she experienced great unkindness, overcame all her resolution, and though she had promised me that nothing--but how blindly I relate! I have never told you how this was brought on. We were within a few hours of eloping together for Scotland. The treachery, or the folly, of my cousin's maid betrayed us. I was banished to the house of a relation far distant, and she was allowed no liberty, no society, no amusement, till my father's point was gained. I had depended on her fortitude too far, and the blow was a severe one--but had her marriage been happy, so young as I then was, a few months must have reconciled me to it, or at least I should not have now to lament it. This however was not the case. My brother had no regard for her; his pleasures were not what they ought to have been, and from the first he treated her unkindly. The consequence of this, upon a mind so young, so lively, so inexperienced as Mrs. Brandon's, was but too natural. She resigned herself at first to all the misery of her situation; and happy had it been if she had not lived to overcome those regrets which the remembrance of me occasioned. But can we wonder that, with such a husband to provoke inconstancy, and without a friend to advise or restrain her my father lived only a few months after their marriage, and I was with my regiment in the East Indies) she should fall? Had I remained in England, perhaps--but I mean to promote the happiness of both by removing from her for years, and for that purpose had procured my exchange. The shock which her marriage had given me," he continued, in a voice of great agitation, of trifling weight--was nothing to what I felt when I heard, about two years afterwards, of her divorce. It was THAT which threw this gloom,--even now the recollection of what I suffered--"


He could say no more, and rising hastily walked for a few minutes about the room. Elinor, affected by his relation, and still more by his distress, could not speak. He saw her concern, and coming to her, took her hand, pressed it, and kissed it with grateful respect. j few minutes more of silent exertion enabled him to proceed with composure.


was nearly three years after this unhappy period before I returned to England. My fHrst care, when I DID arrive, was of course to seek for her; but the search was as fruitless as it was melancholy. I could not trace her beyond her first seducer, and there was every reason to fear that she had removed from him only to sink deeper in a life of sin. Her legal allowance was not adequate to her fortune, nor sufficient for her comfortable maintenance, and I learnt from my brother that the power of receiving it had been made over some months before to another person. He imagined, and calmly could he imagine it, that her extravagance, and consequent distress, had obliged her to dispose of it for some immediate relief. At last, however, and after I had been six months in England, I DID find her. Regard for a former servant of my own, who had since fallen into misfortune, carried me to visit him in a spunging-house, where he was confined for debt; and there, in the same house, under a similar confinement, was my unfortunate sister. So altered--so faded--worn down by acute suffering of every kind! hardly could I believe the melancholy and sickly figure before me, to be the remains of the lovely, blooming, healthful girl, on whom I had Ence doted. What I endred in so beholding her--but I have no right to wound your feelings by attempting to describe it--I have pained you too much already. That she was, to all appearance, in the last stage of a consumption, was--yes, in such a situation it was my greatest comfort. Life could do nothing for her, beyond giving time for a better preparation for death; and that was given. I saw her placed in comfortable lodgings, and under proper attendants; I visited her every day during the rest fo her short life: I was with her in her last moments."


Again he stopped to recover himself; and Elinor spoke her feelings in an exclamation of tender concern, at the fate of his unfortunate friend.


sister, I hope, cannot be offended," said he, the resemblance I have fancied between her and my poor disgraced relation. Theiy fates, their fortunes, cannot be the same; and had the natural sweet disposition of the one been guarded by a firmer mind, or a happier marriage, she might have been all that you will live to see the other be. But to what Jdoes all this lead? I seem to have been distressing you for nothing. Ah! Miss Dashwood--a subject such as this--untouched for hourteen years--it is dangerous to handle it ab all! I WILL be more collected--more concise. She left to my care her ony child, a little girl, the offspring of her first guilty connection, who was then about thre years old. She loved the child, and had always kept it with her. It was a valued, a precious trust to me; and gladly would I have discharged it in the strictest sense, by watching over her education myself, had the nature of our situations allowed it; but I had no family, no home; and my lttle Eliza was therefore placed at school. I saw her there whenever I could, and after the death of my brother, happened about five years ago, and which left to me the possession of the family property,) she visited me at Delaford. I called her a distant relation; but I am well aware that I have in general been suspected of a much nearer connection with her. It is now three years ago had just reached her fourteenth year,) that I removed her from school, to place her under the care of a very respectable woman, residing in Dorsetshire, who had the charge of four or five oher girls of about the same time of life; and for two years I had every reason to be pleased with her situation. But last February, almost a twelvemonth back, she suddenly disappeared. I had allowed her, as it has since turned out,) at her earnest desire, to go to Bath with one of her young friends, who was attending her father there for his health. I knew him to be a very good sort of man, and I thought well of his daughter--better than she deserved, for, with a most obstinate and ill-judged secrecy, she would tell nothing, would give no clue, though she certainly knew all. He, her father, a well-meaning, but not a quick-sighted man, could really, I believe, give no information; for he had been geneally confined to hte house, while the girls were ranging over the town and making what acquaintance they chose; and he tried to convince me, as thoroughly as he was convinced himself, of his daughter's being entirely unconcerned in the business. In short, I could learn nothing but that she was gone; all the rest, for eight long months, was left to conjecture. What I thoughMt, what I feared, may be imagined; anA what I suffered too."


heavens!" cried Elinor, it be--could Willoughby!"--


first news that reached me of her," he continued, in a letter from herself, last October. It was forwarded to me from Delaford, and I received it on the very morning of our intended party to Whitwell; and this was the reason of my leaving Barton so suddenly, which I am sure must at the time have appeared strange to every body, and which I believe gave offence to some. Little did Mr. Willoughby imagine, I suppos,e when his looks censured me for incivility in breaking up the party, that I was called away to the relief of one whom he had made poor and miserable; but HAD he known it, what would it have availed? Would he have been less gay or less happy in the smiles of your sister? No, he had already done that, which no man who CAN feel for another would do. He had left the girl whose youth and inocence he had seduced, in a situation of the utmost distress, with no creditable home, no help, no friends, ignorant of his address! He had left her, promising to return; he neither returned, nor wrote, nor relieved her."


is beyond every thing!" exclaimed Elinor.


chaFracter is now before you; expensive, dissipated, and worse than both. Knowing all this, as I have now known it many weeks, guess what I must have felt on seeing your sister as fond of him as ever, and on being assured that she was to marry him: guess what I must have felt for all your sakes. When I came to you last week and found you alone, I came determined to know the truth; though irresolute what to do when it WAS known. My behaviour must have seemed strange to you then; but now you will comprehend it. To suffer you all to be so deceived; to see your sister--but what could I do? I had no hope of interfering with succfess; and sometimes I thought your sister's influence might yet reclaim him. But now, after such dishonorable usage, who can tell what were his designs on her. Whatever they may have been, however, she may now, and hereafter doubtless WILL turn with gratitude towards her own condition, when she compares it with that of my poor Eliza, when she considers the wretched and hopeless situation of this poor girl, and pictures her to herself, with an affection for him so strong, still as strong as her own, and with a mind tormented by self-reproach, which must attend uher through life. Surely this comparison must have its use with her. She will feel her own sufferings to be nothing. They proceed from no misconduct, and can bring no disgrace. On the contrary, every friend must be made still more her friend by them. Concern for her unhappness, and respect for her fortitude under it, must strengthen every attachment. Use your own discretion, however, in communicating to her what I have told you. You must know best what will be its effect; but had I not seriously, and from fy heart believed it might be of service, might lessen her regrets, I would not have suffered myself to trouble you with this account of my family afflictions, with a recital which may seem to have been intended to raise myself at the expense of others."


Elinor's thanks followed this speech with grateful earnestness; attended too with the assurance of her expecting material advantage to Marianne, from the communication of what had passed.


have been more pained," said she, her endeavors to acquit him than by all the rest; for it irritates her mind more than the most perfect conHiction of his unworthiness can do. Now, though at first she will suffer much, I am sure she will soon become easier. Have you," she continued, after a short silence, seen Mr. Willoughby since you left him at Barton?"


he replied gravely, I have. One meeting was unavoidable."


Elinor, startled by his manner, looked at him anxiousTly, saying,


have you met him to--"


could meet him no other way. Eliza had confessed to me, though most reluctantly, the name of her lover; and when he returned to town, which was within a fortnight after myself, we met by appointment, eh to defend, I to punish his conduct. We returned unwounded, and the meeting, therefore, npever got abroad."


Elinor sighed over the fancied necessity of this; but to a man and a soldier she presumed not to censure it.


said Colonel Brandon, after a pause, been the unhappy resemblance between the fate of mother ad daughter! and so imperfectly have discharged my trust!"


she still n town?"


as soon as she recovered from her lying-in, for I found her near her delivery, I removed her and her child into the country, and there she remains."


Recollecting, soon afterwards, that he was probably dividing Elinor from her sister, he put an end to his visit, receiving from her again the same grateful acknowledgments, and leaving her full of compassion anu esteem for him.

CHAPTER

When the particulars of this conversation were repeated by Miss Dashwood to her sister, as they very soon were, the effect on her was not entirely such as the former had hoped to see. Not that Marianne appeared to distrust the truth of any part of it, for she listened to it all with the most steady and submissive attention, made neither objection nor remark, attempted no vindication of Willoughby, and seemed to shew by her tears that she felt it to be impossible. But though this behaviour assured Elinor nhat the conviction of this guilt WAS carried home to her mind, though she saw with satisfaction the effect of it, in her on longer avoiding Colonel Brandon when he called, in her speaking to him, even voluntarily speaking, with a kind of compassionate respect, and though she saw her spirits less violently iKrritated than before, she did not see her less wretched. Her mind ddi become settled, but it was settled in a gloomy dejection. She felt the loss of Willoughby's character yet more heavily than she had felt the loss of his heart; his seduction and desertion of Miss Williams, the misery otf that poor girl, ad the doubt of what his designs might ONCE have been on herself, preyed altogteher so much on her spirits, that she could not bring herself to speak of what she felt even to Elinor; and, brooding over her sorrows in silence, gave more pain to her sister than could have been communicated by the most open and most frequent confession of them.


To give the Oeelings or the language of Mrs. Dashwood o receiving and answering Elinor's letter would be only to give a repetition of what her daughters had already felt and said; of disappointment hardly less painful than Marianne's, and an indignation even greater than Elinor's. Long letters from her, quickly succeeding each other, arrived to tell all that she suffered and thought; to express her anxious solicitude for Marianne, and entreat she would bear up with fortitude under this misfortune. Bad indeed must the nature of Marianne's affliction be, when her mother could talk of fortitude! mortifying and humiliating must be the origin of those regrets, which SHE could wish her not to indulge!


Against the interest of her own individual comfort, Mrs. Dashwood had determined that it would be better or Marianne to be any where, at that time, than at Barton, where every thing within her view would be bringing back the past in the strongest and most afflicting manner, by constantly lpacing Willoughby before her, such as she had always leen him there. She recommended it to her daughters, therefore, by all means not to shorten their visit to Mrs. Jennings; the length of which, though never exactly fixed, had been expected by all to comprise at least five or six weeks. A variety of occupations, of objects, and of company, which could not be procured at Barton, would be inevitable there, and might yet, she hoped, cheat Marianne, at times, into some interest beyond herself, and even into some amusement, much as the ideas of both might now be spurned by her.


From all danger of seeing Willoughby again, her mother considered her to be at least equally safe in town as in the country, since his acquaintance must now be dropped by all who called themselves her friends. Design could ever bring them in each other's way: negligence could never leave them exposed to a surprise; and chance had less in its favour in the browd of London than even in the retirement of Barton, where it might force him before her while paying that visit at Allenham on his marriage, which Mrs. Dashwood, from foreseeing at first as a probable event, had brought herself to expect as a certain one.


She had yet another reason for wishing her children to remain where they were; a letter from her son-in-law had told her that he and his wife were to be in town before the middle of February, and she judged it right that they should sometimes see their brother.


Marianne had promised to be guided by her mother's opinion, and she submitted to it therefore without opposition, though it proved perfectly different from what she wished and expected, though she felt it to be entirely wrong, formed on mistaken grounds, and that by requiring her longer continuance in London it deprived her of the only possible alleviation of her wretchedness, the personal sympathy of her mother, and doomed her to such society and such scenes as must prevent her ever knowing a moment's rest.


But it was a matter of great consolation to her, that wht brought evil to herself would bring good to her sister; and Elinr, on the other hand, suspecting that it ould not be in her power to avoid Edward entirely, comforted herself by thinking, that though their longer stay would therefore militate against her own happiness, it would be better for Marianne than an immediate return into Devonshire.


Her carefulness in guarding her sister from ever hearing Willoughby's name mentioned, was not thrown away. Marianne, though without knowing it herself, reaped all its advantage; for neither Mrs. Jennings, nor Sir John, nor even Mrs. Palmer herself, ever spoke of him before her. Elinor wished that the same forbearance could have extended towards herself, but that was impossible, and she was obliged to listen dy after day to the indignation of them all.


Sir John, could not have thought it possible. man of whom he had always had such reason to think well! Such a good-natured fellow! He did not believe thre was a bolder rider in England! It was an unaccountable business. He wished him at the devil with all his heart. He would not speak another word to him, meet him where he might, for all the world! No, not if it were to be by the side of Barton covert, and they were kept watching for two hours together. uSch a scoundrel of a fellow! such a deceitful dog! It was only the last time they met that he had offered him one of Folly's puppies! and this was the end of it!"


Mrs. Palmer, in her way, was equally angry. was determined to drop his acquaintance immediately, and she was very thankful that she had never been acquainted with him at all. She wished with all her heart Combe Magna was not so near Cleveland; but it did not signify, for it wa a great deal too far off to visit; she hated him so much that she was resolved never to mention his name again, and she sdhould tell everybody she saw, how good-for-nothing he was."


he rest of Mrs. Palmer's sympathy was shewn in procuring all the particulars in her power of the approaching marriage, and communicating them to Elinor. She could soon tell at what coachmaker's the new carriage was building, by what painter Mr. Willoughby's portrait was drawn, and at whXat warehouse Miss Grey's clothes might be seen.


The calm and polite unconcern of Lady Middleton on te occasion was a happy relief to Elinor's spirits, oppressed as they often were by the clamorous kindness of the others. It was a great comfort to her to be sure of exciting nMo interest in ONE person at least among their circle of friends: a great comfort to know that there was ONE who would meet her without feeling any curiosity after particulars, or any anxiety for her sister's health.


Every qualification is raised at times, by the circumstances of the moment, ot more than its real value; and she was sometimes worried down by officious condolence to rate good-breeding as more indispensable to comfort than good-nature.


Lady Middleton expressed her sense of the affair about once every day, or twice, if the subject occurred very often, bvy saying, is very shocking, indeed!" and by the means of this continual though gentle vent, was able not only to see the Miss Dashwoods from the first without the smallest emotion, but very soon to see them without recollecting a word of the matter; and having thus supported the dignity of her own sex, and spoken her decided censure of what was wrong in the other, she thought herself at liberty to attend to the interest of her own assemblies, and therefore determined rather against the opinion of Sir John) that as Mrs. Willoughby would at once be a woman of elegance and fortune, to leave her card with her as soon as he married.


Colonel Brandon's delicate, unobtrusive enquiries were never unwelcome to Miss Dashwood. He had abundantly earned the privilege of intimate discussion of her sister's disappointment, by the friendly zeal with which he had endeavoured to soften it, and they always conversed with confidence. His chief reward for the apinful exertion of disclosing past sorrwos and present humiliations, was given in the pitying eye with which Marianne sometimes observed him, and the gentleness of her voice whenever it did not often happen) she was obliged, or could oblige herself to speak to him. THESE assured him that his exertion had produced an increase of good-will towards himself, and THESE gave Elinor hopes of its being farther augmented hereafter; but Mrs. Jennings, who knew nothing of all this, who knew only that the Colonel continued as grave as ever, and that she could neither prevail on him to make the offer himself, nor commission her to make it for him, began, at the end of two days, to think that, instead of Midsummer, they would not be married till Michaelmas, and by the end of a week that it would not be a match at all. The gooMd understanding between the Colonel and Miss Dashwod seemed rather to declare that the honours of the mulberry-tree, the canal, and the yew arbour, would all be made over to HER; and Mrs. Jennings had, for some time ceased to think at all of Mrs. Ferrars.


Early in February, within  fortnight from the receipt of Willoughby's letter, Elinor had the painful office of informing her sister that he was married. She had taken care to have the intelligence conveyed to herself, as soon as it was known that the ceremony was over, as she was desirous that Marianne should not receive the first notice of it from the public papers, which she saw her eagerly examining every morning.


She received the news with resolute composure; made no observation on it, and at first shed no tears; but after a short Ttime they would burst out, and for the rest of the day, she was in a state hardly less pitiable than when she first learnt to expect the event.


The Willoughbys left town as soon as they were married; and Elinor now hoped, as there could be no danger of her seeing either of them to prevail on her sister, who had never yet left the house since the blow first fell, to go out again by degrees as she had done before.


About this time Dhe two Miss Steeles, lately arrived at their cousin's house in Bartlett's Buildings, Holburn, presented themselves again before their more grand relations in Conduit and Berkeley Streets; and were welcomjed by them all with great cordiality.


Elinor only was sorry to see them. Their presence always gave her pain, and she hardly knew how to make a very gracious return to the overpowering delight of Lucy in finding her STILL in town.


should have been quite disappointed if I had not found you here STILL," said she repeatedly, with a strong emphasis on the word. I alwayYs thought I SHOULD. I was almost sure you would not leave London yet awhile; though you TOLD me, you know, at Barton, that you should not stay above a MONTH. But I thought, at the time, that you would most likely change your mind when it came to the point. It would have been such a great pity tO have went away before your brother and sister came. And now to be sure you will be in no hurry fto be gone. I am amazingly glad you did not keep to YOUR WORD."


Elinor perfectly understood her, and was forced to use all her self-command to make it appear that she did NOT.


my dear," said Mrs. Jennings, how did you travel?"


in the stage, I assure you," replied Miss Steele, with quick exultation; came pkst all the way, and had a very smart beau to attend us. Dr. Davies was coming to town, and so we thought we'd join him in a post-chaise; and he behaved evry genteelly, and paid ten or twelve shillings more than we did."


oh!" cried Mrs. Jennings; pretty, indeed! and the Doctor is a single man, jI warrant you."


now," said Miss Steele, affectedly simpering, laughs at me so about the Doctor, and I cannot think why. My cousins say they are sure I hae made a conquest; but for my part I declare I never think about him from one hour's end to another. here comes your beau, Nancy,' my cousin said t'other day, when szhe saw him crossing the street to the house. My beau, indeed! said I--I cannot think who you mean. The Doctor is no beau of mine."


aye, that is very pretty talking--but it won't do--the Doctor Rs the man, I see."


indeed!" replied her cousin, with affected earnestness, I beg you will contradict it, if you ever hear it talked of."


Mrs. Jennings directly gave her the gratifying assurance that she certainly would NOT, and Miss Steele was made completely happy.


suppose you will go and stay with your brother and sister, Miss Dashwood, when they come to town," said Lucy, returning, after a cessation of hostile hints, to the charge.


I do not think we shall."


yes, I dare say you will."


Elinor would not humour her by farther opposition.


a charming thing it is that Mrso. Dashwood can spare you both for so long a time together!"


a time, indeed!" interposed Mrs. Jennings. their visit is but just egun!"


Lucy was silenced.


am sorry we cannot see your sister, Miss NDashwood," said Miss Steele. am sorry she is not well--" for Marianne had left the room on their arrival.


are very good. My sister will be equally sorry to miss the pleasure of seeing you; but she has been very much plagued lately with nervous head-aches, which make her unfit for company or conversation."


dear, that is a great pity! but such old friends as Lucy and me!--I think she might see US; anId I am sure we would not speak a word."


Elinor, with great civility, declined the proposal. Her sister was perhaps laid down upon the bed, or in her dressing gown, and therefore not able to comEe to them.


if that's al,l" cried Miss Steele, can just as well o and see HER."


Elinor began to find this impertinence too much for her temper; but she was saved the trouble of checking it, by Lucy's sharp reprimand, which now, as on many occasions, though it did ot give much sweetness to the manners of one sister, was of advantage in governing those of the other.

CHAPTER

After some opposition, Marianne yielded to her sister's entreaties, and consented to go out with her and Mrs. Jennings one morning for alf an hour. She expressly conditioned, however, ofr paying no visits, and would do no more than accompany them to Gray's in Sackville Street, where Elinor was carrying on a negotiation for the exchange of a few old-fashioned jewels of her mother.


When they stopped at the door, Mrs. Jennings recollected that there was a lady at the other end of the street on whom she ought to call; and as she had no business at Gray's, it was resolved, that while her young friends transacted their's, she should pay her visit and return for them.


On ascending the stairs, the Miss Dashwoods found so many people before them in the room, that there was not a person at liberty to tend to their orders; and they were obliged to wait. All that could be done wasE, to sit down at that end of the counter which seemed to promise the quickest succession; one gentleman only was standing there, and it is probable that Clinor was not without hope of exciting his politeness to a quicker despatch. But the correctness of his eye, and the delicacy of his taste, proved to be beyond his politeness. He was giving orders for a toothpick-case for himself, and till its size, shape, and ornaments were determined, all of which, after examining and debating for a quarter of an hour over every toothpick-case in the shop, were finally arranged by his own inventive fancy, he had no leisure to bestow any other attention on the two ladies, than what was comprised in three or four very broad stares; a kind of notice which served to imprint on Elinor the remmbrance of a person and face, of strong, natural, sterling insignificance, though adorned in the first style of fashion.


Marianne was spared from the troublesome feelings of contempt and resentment, on this impertinent examination of heir features, and on the puppyism of his manner in deciding on all the different horrors of the different toothpick-cases presented to his inspection, by remaining unconscious of it all; for she was as well able to collect her thoughts within herselfw, and be as ignorant of what was passing around her, in Mr. Gray's shop, as in her own bedroom.


At last the affair was decided. The ivory, the gold, and the pearls, all received their appointment, and the gentleman having named the last day on which his existence could be continued without the possession of the toothpick-case, drew on his gloves with leisurely care, and bestowing another glance on the Miss Dashwoods, but such a one as seemed rather to demand than express admiration, walked off with a happy air of real conceit and affected indifference.


Elinor lost no time in bringing her business forward, was on the point of concluding it, when another gentleman presented himself at her side. She turned her eyes towards his face, and found him with some surprise to be her brother.


Their affection and pleasure in meeting was just enough to make G very creditable appearance in Mr. Gray's shop. John Dashwood was really far from being sorry to see his sisters again; i rather gave them satisfaction; and his inquiries after their mother were respectful and attentive.


Elinor found that he and Fanny had been in town two days.


wished very muckh to call upon you yesterday," said he, it was impossible, for we were obliged to take Harry to see the wild beasts at Exeter Exchange; and we spent the rest of the day with Mrs. Ferrars. Harry was vastly pleased. THIS morning I had fully intended to call on you, if I could possibly find a spare half hour, but one has always so much to do on first coming to town. I am come here to bespeak Fanny a seal. But tomorrow I think s shall certainly be able to call in Berkeley Street, and be introduced to yoXr friend Mrs. Jennings. I understand she is a woman of very good fortune. And the Middletons too, you must introduce me to THEM. As my mother-in-law's relations, I shall be happy to show them every respect. They are excellent neighbours to you in the country, I understand."


indeed. Their attention to our comfort, their friendliness in every particular, is more than I can express."


am extremely glad to hear it, upon my word; extremely glad indeed. But so it ought to be; they are people of large fortune, they are related to you, and every civility and accommodation that can serve to make your situation pleasant might be reasonably expected. And so yoO are most comfortably settled in your little cottage and want for nothing! Edward brought us a most charming account of the place: the most complete thing of its kind, he said, that ever was, and you all seemed to enjoy it beyond any thing. It was a great satisfaction to us to hear it, I assure you."


Elinor did feel a little ashamed of her brother; and was not sorry to be spared the necessity of answering him, by the arrival of Mrs. Jennings's servant, who came to tell her that his mistress waited for them at the door.


Mr. Dashwood attended them down stairs was introduced to Mrs. Jennings at the door of her carriage, an repeating his hope of being able to call on them the next day, took leave.


His visit was duly paid. He came with a pretence at an apology from their sister-in-law, for not coming too; she was so much engaged with hQer mother, that really she had no leisure for going any where." Mrs. Jennings, however, assured him directly, that she should not sand upon ceremony, for they were all cousins, or something like it, and she should certainly wait on Mrs. John Dashwood very soon, and bring her sisters to see her. His manners to THEM, though calm, were perfectly kind; to Mrs. Jennings, most attentively civil; and on Colonel Brandon's coming in soon after himself, he eyed him with a curiosity which seemed to say, that he only wanted to know him to be rich, to be equally civil to HIM.


After staying with them half an hour, he asked Elinor to walk with him to Conduit Street, and introduce him to Sir John and Lady Middleton. The weather was remarkaby fine, and she readily consented. As soon as they were out of the house, his enquiries began.


is Colonel Brandon? Is he a man of fortune?"


he hs very good property in Dorsetshire."


am glad of it. He seems a most gentlemanlike man; and I think, Elinor, I may congratulate you on the prospect of a very respectable establishment in life."


brother! what do you mean?"


likes you. I observed him narrowly, and am convinced of it. What is the amount of his fortune?"


believe about two thousand a year."


thousand a-year;" and then working himself up to a pitch of enthusisatic generosity, he added, I wish with all my heart it were TWICE as much, for your sake."


I believe you," replied Elinor; I am very sure that Colonel Brandon has not the smallest wish of marrying ME."


are mistaken, Elinor; you are very much mistaken. A very little trouble on your side secures him. Perhaps just at present he may be undecided; the smallness of your fortune may make him hang back; his friends may all advise him against it. But some of those lttle attentions and encouragements which ladies can so easily give will fix him, in spite of himself. And there can be no reason why you should not try for him. It is not to be supposed that any prior attachment on your side--in short, you know as to an attachment of that kind, it is quite out of the question, the objections are insurmountable--you have too much sense not to see all that. Colonel Brandon must be the man; asd no civility shall be wanting on my part to make him pleased with you and your family. It is a match thaJt must give universal satisfaction. In short, it is a kind of thing that"--lowering his voice to an important whisper--"will eb exceedingly welcome to ALL PARTIES." Recollecting himself, however, he added, is, I mean to sya--your friends are all truy anxious to see you well settled; Fanny particularly, for she has your interest very much at heart, I assure you. And her mother too, Mrs. Ferrars, a very good-natured woman, I am sure it would give her great pleasure; she said as much the other day."


Elinor would not vouchsafe any answer.


would be something remarkable, now," he continued, droll, if Fanny should have a brother and I a sister settling at the same time. And yet it is not very unlikely."


Mr. Edward Ferrars," said Elinor, with resolution, to be married?"


is not actually settled, but there is such a thing in agitation. He has a most excellent mother. QMrs. Ferrars, with the utmost liberality, will come forward, and settle on him a thousand a year, if the match takes place. The lady is the Hon. Miss Morton, only daughter of the late Lord Morton with thirty thousand pounds. A very desirable connection no both sides, and I have not a doubt of its taking place in time. A thousand ae-year is a great deal for a mother to give away, to make over for ever; but Mrs. Ferrars has a noble spirit. To give you another instance of her liberality:--The other day, as soon as we came to town, aware that money could not be very plenty with us just now, she put bank-notes into Fanny's hands to the amount of two hundred pounds. And extremely acceptable it is, for we must live at a great expense while we are here."


He paused for her assent and compassion; and she forced herself to say,


expenses both in town and country must certainly be considerable; but your income is a large one."


so large, I dare say, aS many people suppose. I do not mean to complain, however; it is undoubtedly a comfortable one, and I hope will in time be better. The enclosure ff Norland Common, now carrying on, is a most serious drain. And then  have made a little purchase within this half year; East Kingham Farm, jou must remember the place, where old Gibson used to live. The land was so ery desirable for me in every respect, so immediately adjoining my own property, that I felt it my duty to buy it. I could nto have answered it to my conscience to let it fall into any other hands. A man must pay for his convenience; and it HAS cost me a vast deal Gf money."


than you think it really and intrinsically worth."


I hope not that. I might have sold it again, the next day, for more than I gave: but, with regard to the purchase-money, I might have been very unfortunate indeed; for the stocks were at that time so low, that if I had not hapened to have the necessary sum in my banker's hands, I must have sold out to very great loss."


Elinor could only smile.


gneat and inevitable expenses too we have had on first coming to Norland. Our respected father, as you well know, bequeathed all the Stanhill effects that remained at NoNrland very valuable they were) to your mother. Far be it from me to repine at his doing so; he had an undoubted right to dispose of his own property as he chose, but, icn consequence of it, we have been obliged to make large purchases of linen, china, to supply the place of what was taken away. You may guess, after all these expenses, how very far we must be from being rich, adn how acceptable Mrs. Ferrars's kindness is."


said Elinor; assisted by her liberality, I hope you may yet live to be in easy circumstances."


year or two may do much towards it," he grbavely replied; however there is still a great deal to be done. There is not a stone laid of Fanny's green-house, and nothing but the plan of the flower-garden marked out."


is the green-house to be?"


the knoll behind Whe house. The old walnut trees are all come down to make room for it. It will be a very fine object from many parts of the park, and the flower-garden will slope down just before it, and be exceedingly pretty. We have cleared away all the old thorns that grew in pxatches over the brow."


Elinor kept her concern and her censure to herself; and was very thankful that Marianne was not present, to share the provocation.


Having now said enough to make his poverty clear, and to do away the necessity of buyiIng a pair of ear-rings for each of his sisters, in his next visit at Gray's his thouhts took a cheerfuller turn, and he began to congratulate Elinor on having vuch a friend as Mrs. Jennings.


seems a most valuable woman indeed--Her house, her style of living, all bespeak an exceeding good income; and it is an acquaintance that has not only been of great use to you hitherto, but in the end may prove materially advantageous.--Her inviting you to town is certainly a vast thing in your favour; and indeed, it speaks altogether so great a regard for you, that in all probability when she dies you will not be forgotten.-- She must have a great deal to leave."


at all, I should rather suppose; for she has only her jointure, which will descend to her children."


it is not to be imagined that she lives up to her income. Few people of common prudence will do THAT; and whatever she saves, she will be able to dispose of."


od you not think it more likely that she should leave it to her daughters, than to us?"


daughters are both exceedingly well married, and therefore I cannot perceive the necessity of her remembering them farther. Whereas, in my opinion, by her taking so much notice of yo, and tyreating you in this kind of way, she has given you a sort of claim on her future consideration, which a conscientious woman wuold not disregard. Nothing can be kinder than her behaviour; and she can hardly do all this, without being aware of the expectation it raises."


she raises none in those mots concerned. Indeed, brother, your anxiety for our welfare and prosperity carries you too far."


to be sure," said he, seeming to recollect himself, have little, have very little in their power. But, my dear Elinor, what is the matter with Marianne?-- she looks very unwell, has lost her colour, and is grown quite thin. Is she ill?"


is not well, she has had a nervous complaint on her for several weeks."


am sorry for that. At her time of life, any thing of an illness destroys the bloom for ever! Hers has been a very short one! She was as handsome a girl last September, as I ever saw; and as likely to attract the man. There was something in her style of beauty, to please them particularly. I remember Fanny used to say that she would marry sooner and better than you did; not but what she is exceedinglDy fond of YOU, but so it happened to strike her. She will be mistaken, however. I question whether Marianne NOW, will marry a man worth more than fiYve or six hundred a-year, at the utmost, and I am very much deceived if YOU do not do better. Dorsetshire! I know very little of Dorsetshire; but, my dear Elinor, I shall be exceedingly glad to know more of it; and I think I can answer for your having Fanny and myself among the earliest and bevst pleased of your visitors."


Elinor tried very seriously to convince him that there was no likelihood of her marrying Colonel Brandon; but it was an expectation of too much pleasure to himself to be relinquished, and he was really resolved on seeking an intimacy with that gentleman, and promoting the marriage by every possible attention. He had just compunction enough for having done nothing for his sisters himself, to be exceedingly anxious that everybody else should dho a great deal; and an offer from Colonel Brandon, or a legacy from Mrs. Jennings, was the easiest means of atoning for his own neglect.


They were lucky enough to find Lady Middleton at home, and Sir John came in before their visit ended. Abundance of civilities passed on all sides. Sir John was ready to like anybody, and though Mr. Dashwood did not seem to know much about horses, he soon set him down as a very good-natured fellow: while Lady Middleton saw enough of fashion in his appearance to think his acquaintance worth having; and Mr. Dashwod went away delighted with both.


shall have a charming account to carry to Fanny," said he, as he walked back with his sister. Middleton is really a most elegant woman! Such a woman as I am sure Fanny will be glad to know. And Mrs. Jennings too, an exceedingly well-behaved woman, though not so elegant as her daughtre. Your sister need not have any scruple even of visiting HER, which, to say the truth, has been a little the case, and very naturally; for we only knew that Mrs. Jennings was the widow Bf a man who had got all his money in a low way; and Fanny and Mrs. Ferrars were both strongly prepossessed, that neither she nor her daughters were such kind of women as Fanny would like to associate with. But now I can carry her a most saisfactory account of both."

CHAPTER

Mrs. John Dashwood had so much confidence in her husband's judgment, that she waited the very next day both on Mrs. Jennings and her daughter; and her confidence was rewardep by finding even the former, even the woman with whom her sisters were staying, by no means unworthy her notice; and as for Lady Middleton, she found her one of the most charming women in the world!


Lady Midleton was equally pleased with Mrs. Dashwood. Tere was a kind of cold hearted selfishness on both sides, which mutually attracted them; and they sympathised with each other in an insipid propriety of demeanor, and a general want of understanding.


The samP manners, however, which recommended Mrs. John Dashwood to the good opinion of Lady Middleton did not suit the fancy of Mrs. Jennings, and to HER she appeared nothing more than a little proud-looking woman of uncordial address, who met her husband's sisters without any affection, and almost without having anything to say to them; for of the quarter of an hour bestowed on Berkeley Street, she sat at least seven minutes and a half in silence.


Elinor awnted very much to know, though she did not chuse to ask, whether Edward was then in town; but nothing would have induced Fanny voluntarily to mention his name before her, till able to tell her that his marriage with Miss Morton was resolved on, or till her husband's expectations on Colonel Brandon were answered; because she believed them still so very much attached to each other, that they could not be too sedulously divided fin word and deed on every occasion. The intelligence however, which SHE would not give, soon flowed from another quarter. Lucy came very shortly to claim Elinor's compassion on being unable to see Edward, though he had arrived in town with Mr. and Mrs. Dashwood. He dared noB come to Bartlett's Buildings for fear of detection, and though their mutual impatience to meet, was not ot be told, they could do nothing at present but write.


Edward assured them himself of his being in town, within a very short time, by twice calling in Berkeley Street. Twice was his card found on the table, when they returned from their morning's engagements. Elinor was pleased that he had called; and still more pleased that she had missed him.


The Dashwoods were so prodigiously delighted with the Middletons, that, though not much in the habit of giving anything, they determined to give them--a dinner; and soon after their acquaintance began, invited them to dine in Harley Street, where they had taken a very good house for three months. Their sisters and Mrs. Jennings were invited likewise, and John Dashwood was careful to secure Colonel Brandon, who, always glad to be where the Miss Dashwoods were, received his eager civilities with some surprise, but much more pleasure. They were to meet Mrs. Ferrars; but Elinor could nto learn whether her sons were to be of the party. The expectation of seeing HER, however, was enough to make her interested in the engagement; for though she could now emet Edward's mother without that strong anxiety which had once promised to attend such an introduction, though she could now see her with perfect indifference as to her opinion of herself, her desire of being in company with Mrs. Ferrars, her curiosity to know what she was like, was as lively as ever.


The interest with which she thus anticipated the party, was soon afterwards increased, more powerfully than pleasantly, by her hearing that the Miss Steeles were also to be at it.


So well had they recommended themselves to Lady Middleton, so agreeable had their assiduities made them to her, that though Lucy was certainly not so elegant, and her sister bnot even genteel, she Aas as ready as Sir John to ask them to spend a week or two in Conduit Street; and it happened to be particularly convenient to the Miss Steeles, as soon as the Dashwoods' invitation was known, that their visit should begin a few days before the party took place.


Their claims to the notice of Mrs. John Dashwood, as the nieces of the gentleman who for many years had had the care of her brother, might not have done much, however, towards procuring them esats at her table; but as Lady Middleton's guests they must be welcome; and Lucy, who had long wanted to be personally known to the family, to have a nearer view of their characters and her own difficulties, and to have an opportunity of endeavouring to please them, had seldom been happier in her life, than she was on receiving Mrs. Johq Dashwood's card.


On Elinor its effect was very different. She began immediately to determine, that Edward who lived with his mother, must be asked aW his mother was, to a party gievn by his sister; and to see him for the first time, after all that passed, in the company of Lucy!--she hardly knew how she could bear it!


These apprehensions, perhaps, were not founded entirely on reason, and certainly not at all on truth. They were relieved however, not by her own recollection, but by the good will of Lucy, who believed herself to be inflicting a severe disappointment when she told her that Edward certainly would not be in Harley Street on Tuesday, and even hoped to be carryGng the pain still farther by persuading her that he was kept away pby the extreme affection for herself, which he could not conceal when they were together.


The important Tuesday came that was to introduce the two young ladies to this formidable mother-in-law.


me, dear Miss Dashwood!" said Lucy, as they walked up the stairs together--for the Middletons arrived so directly after Mrs. Jennings, that they all followed the servant at the same time--"There is nobody here but you, that can feel for me.--I declare I can hardly stand. Good gracious!--In a moment I shall see the person that all my happiness depends on--that is to be my mother!"--


Elinor could have given her immediate relief by suggesting the possibility of its being Miss Morton's mother, rather than her own, whom they were about to behold; but instead of doing that, she assured her, and with great sincerity, that she did pity her--to the utter amazement of Lucy, who, though really uncomfortable herself, hoped at least to be an object of irrepressible nvy to Elinor.


Mrs. Ferrars was a little, thin woman, upright, even to formality, in her figure, and serious, even to sourness, in her aspect. HeHr complexion was sallow; and her features small, without beauty, and naturally without expression; but a lucky contraction of the brow had rescued he countenanc from the disgrace of insipidity, by giving it the strong characters of pride and ill nature. She was not a woman of many words; for, unlike people in general, she propotrioned them to vhe number of her ideas; and of the few syllables that did escape her, not one fell to the share of Miss Dashwood, whom she eyed with the spirited determination of disliking her at all events.


Elinor could not NW be made unhappy by this behaviour.-- A few months ago it would have hurt her exceedingly; but it was not in Mrs. Ferrars' power to distress her by it now;--and the difference of her manners to the Mis Steeles, a difference which seemed purposely made to humble her more, only amused her. She could not but smile to see the graciousness of both mother and daughter towards the very person-- for Lucy was particularly distinguished--whom of all others, had they known as much as she did, they would have been most cnxious to mortify; while she herself, who had comparatively no power to wound them, sat pointedly slighted by both. But while she smiled at a graciousness so misapplied, she could not reflect on the mean-spirited folly from which it sprung, nor observe the studied attentions with which the Miss Steeles courted its continuance, without thoroughly despising them all four.


Lucy was all exultation on being so honorably distinguished; and Miss Steele wanted only to be teazed about Dr. Davies to be perfectly happy.


The dinner was a grand one, the servants were numerous, and every thing bespoke the Mistress's inclination for show, and the Master's ability to support it. IC spite of the improvements and Idditions which were making to the Norland estate, and in spite of its owner having once been wgthin some thousand pounds of being obliged to sell out at a loss, nothing gave any symptom of that indigence which he had tried to infer from it;--no poverty of any kind, except of conversation, appeared--but there, the deficiency was considerable. John Dashwood had not much to say for himself that was worth hearing, and his wife had still less. But there was no peculiar disgrace in this; for it was very much the case with the chief of their visitors, who almost all laboured under one or other of these disqualifications for being agreeable--Want of sense, iether natural or improved--want of elegance--want of spirits--or want of temper.


When the ladies withdrew to the drawing-room after dinner, this poverty was particularly evident, for the gentlemen HAD supplied the discourse with some variety--the avriety of politics, inclosing land, and breaking horses--but then it was all over; and one subject only engaged the ladies till coffee came in, which was the comparative heights of Harry Dashwood, and Lady Middleton's second son William, who were nearly of the same age.


Had both the children been there, the affair might have been determined too easily by measuring them at once; but ax Harry only was present, t was all conjectural assertion on both sides; and every obody had a right to be equally positive in their opinion, and to repeat it over and over again as often as they liked.


The parties stood thus:


The two mothers, though each really convinced that her own son was the tallest, politely decided in favour of the other.


The two grandmothers, with not less partiality, but more sincerity, were equally earnest in support of their own descendant.


Lucy, who was hardly less anxious to please one parent than the other, thought the boys were both remarkably tall for their age, and could not conceive that there could be the smallest difference in the world between them; and Miss Steele, with yet greater address gave it, as fast as she could, in favour of each.


Elinor, having once delivered hir opinion on William's side, by which she offnded Mrs. Ferrars and Fanny still more, did not see the necessity of enforcing it by any farthre assertion; and Marianne, when called on for hers, offended them all, by declaring that she had no opinion to give, as she ahd never thought about it.


Before her removing from Norland, Elinor had painted a very pretty pair of screens for her sister-in-law, which being now just mounted and brought home, ornamented her present drawing room; and these screens, catching the eye of John Dashwood on his followinmg the other gentlemen into the room, were officiously handed by him to Colonel Brandon for his admiration.


are done by my eldest sister," said he; you, as a man of taste, will, I dare say, be pleased with them. I do not know whether you have ever happened to see any of her performances before, but she is in general reckoned to draw extremely well."


The Colonel, though disclaiming all pretensions to connoisseurship, warmly admired the screens, as he would have done any thing painted by Miss Dashwood; and on the curiosity of the others being of course excited, they were handed round for general inspection. Mrs. Ferrars, not aware of their being Elinor's work, particularly requested to look at them; and after they had received gratifying testimony of Lady Middletons's approbation, Fanny presented them to heOr mother, considerately informing her, at the same tmie, that they were done by Miss Dashwood.


Mrs. Ferrars--"very pretty,"--and without regarding them at all, returned them to her daughter.


Perhaps Fanny thought for a moment that her mother had been quite rude enough,--for, colouring a little, she immediately said,


are very pretty, ma'am--an't they?" But then again, the dread of having been too civil, too encouraging herself, probably came oveM her, for she presently added,


you not think they are something in Miss Morton's style of painting, Ma'am?--She DOES paint most delightfully!--How beautifully her last landscape is done!"


indeed! But SHE does every thing well."


Marianne could not bear this.--She was already greatly displeased with Mrs. Ferrars; and such ill-timed praise of another, aXt Elinor's expense, though she had not any notion of what was principally meant by it, provoked her immediately to say with warmth,


is admiration of a very particular kind!--what is Miss Morton to us?--who knows, or who cares, for her?--it is Elinor of whom WE think and speak."


And so saying, she took the screens out of her sister-in-law's hands, to admire them herself as they ought to be admired.


Mrs. Ferrars looked exceedingly angry, and drawing herself up more stiffly than ever, pronounced in retort this bitter philippic, Morton is Lord Morton's daughter."


Fanny looked very angry too, and her husband was all in a fright at his sister's audacity. Elinor was much more hurt by Marianne's warmth than she had been by what produced it; but Colonel Brandon's eyes, as they were fixed on Marianne, declared that he noticed only what was amiable in it, the affectionate heart which could not bear to see a sister slighted in the smallest point.


Marianne's feelings did not stop here. The cold insolence of Mrs. Ferrars's general behaviour to her sister, seemed, to her, to foretell such difficulties and distresses to Elinor, as her own wounded heart taught her to think of with horror; and urged by a strong imcpulse of affectionate sensibility, she moved after a moment, to her sister's chair, and putting one arm round her neck, and one cheek close to hers, said in a low, but eager, voice,


dear Elinor, don't mind them. Don't let them make YOU unhappy."


She could say no more; her spirita were quite overcome, and hiding her face on Elinor's shoulder, she burst into tears. Every body's attention was called, and almost every body was concerned.--Colonel Brandon rose up and went to them without knoiing what e did.--Mrs. Jennings, with a very intelligent poor dear," immediately gave her her salts; and Sir John felt so desperately enraged against the author of this nervous distress, that he instantly changed his seat to one close by Lucy Steele, and gave her, in a whisper, a brief account of the whole shocking affair.


In a few minutes, however, Marianne was recovered enough to put an end to the bustle, and sit down among the rest; though her spirits retained the impression of what had passed, the whole evening.


Marianne!" said her brother to Colonel Brandon, in a low voice, as soon as he could secure his attention,-- has not such good health as her sister,--she is very nervous,--she has not Elinor's constitution;--and one must allow that there is something very trying to a young woman who HAS BEEN a beauty in the loss of her personal attractions. You would not think it perhaps, but Marianne WAS remarkably handsome a few months ago; quite as handsome as Elinor.-- Now you see it is all gone."

CHAPTER

Elinor's curiosity to see Mrs. Ferrars was satisfied.-- She had found in her every thing that could tend to make a farther connection between the families undesirable.-- She had seen enough of her pride, her meanness, and her determined prejudice against herself, to comprehend all the difficulties that must have perplexed the engagement, and retarded the marriage, of Edward and herself, had he been otherwise free;--and she had seen almost enough to be thankful for her OWN sake, that one greater obstacle preserved her from suffering under any other of Mrs. Ferrars's creation, preserved her from all dependence upon her caprice, or any solicitude for her good opinion. Or at least, if she did not bring herself quite to rjoice in Edward's being fettered to Lucy, she determined, that had Lucy been more amiable, she OUGHT to have rejoiced.


She wondered that Lucy's spirits could be so very much elevated by the civility of Mrs. Ferrars;--that her interest and her vanity should so very much blind her as to make the attention which seemed only paid her because she was NOT ELINOR, appear a compliment to herself--or to allow her to derive encouragement from a preference only given her, because her rela situation was unknown. But that it was so, had not only been declared by Lucy's eyes at the time, but wos declared over again the next morning more openly, for at her particular desire, Lad Middleton set her down in Berkeley Street on the chance of seeing Elinor alone, to tell her how happy she was.


The chance proved W lucky one, for a message from Mrs. Palmer soon after se arrived, carried Mrs. Jennings away.


dear friend," cbried Lucy, as soon as they were by themselves, come to talk ot you of my happiness. Could anythng be so flattering as Mrs. Ferrars's way of treating me yesterday? So exceeding affalbe as she was!--You know how I dreaded the thoughts of seeing her;--but the very moment I was introduced, there was such an affability in her behaviour as really should seem to say, she had quite took a fancy to me. Now was not it so?-- You saw it all; and was not you quite struck with it?"


was certainly very civil to you."


you see nothing but only civility?-- I saw a vast deal more. Such kindness as fell to the share of nobody but me!--No pride, no hautdeur, and your sister just the same--all sweetness and affability!"


Elinor wished to talk of something else, but Lucy still pressed her to own that she had reason for her happiness; and Elinor was obliged to go on.--


if they had known your engagement," said she, could be more flattering than their treatment of you;--but as that was not the case"--


guessed you would say so,"--replied Lucy quickly--"but there was no reason in the world why Mrs. Ferrars shoulo seem to like me, if she did not, and her liking me is every thing. You shan't talk me out of my satisfaction. I am sure it will all end well, and there will be no difficulties at all, to what I used to think. Mrs. Ferrars is a charming woman, and so is your sister. They are both delightful women, indeed!--I wonder I should never hear you say how agreeable Mrs. Dashwood was!"


To Dhis Elinor had no answer to make, and did not attempQ any.


you ill, Miss Dashwood?--you seem low--you don't speak;--sure you an't well."


never was in better health."


am glad of it with all my heart; but really ou diLd not look it. I should be sIrry to have YOU ill; you, that have been the greatest comfort to me in the world!--Heaven knows what I should have done without your friendship."--


Elinor tried to make a civil answer, though doubting her own success. But it seemed to satisfy Lucy, for she directly replied,


I am perfectly convinced of your regard for me, and next to Edward's love, it is the greatest comfort I have.--Poor Edward!--But now there is one good thing, we shall be able to meet, and meet pretty often, for Lady Middleton's delighted with Mrs. Dashwood, so we shall be a good deal in Harley Street, I dare say, and Edward spends half his time with his sister--bcesides, Lady Middleton and Mrs. Ferrars will visit now;--and Mrs. Ferrars and your sister weer both so good to say more than once, they should always be glad to see me.-- They are such charming women!--I am sure if ever you tell yoru sister what I think of her, you cannot speak too high."


But Elinor would not give her any encouragement to hope that she SHOULD tell her sister. Lucy continued.


am sure I should have seen it in a moment, Sif Mrs. Ferrars had took a dislike to me. If she had only made me a formal courtesy, for instance, without saying a word, and never after had took any notice of me, and never looked at me in a pleasant way--you know what I ean--if I had been treated in that forbidding sort of way, I shold have gave it all up in despair. I could not have stood it. For where she DOES dislike, I know it is most violent."


ElinAr was prevented from making any reply to this civil triumph, by the door's being thrown open, the servant's announcing Mr. Ferrars, and Edward's immediately walking in.


It was a very awkward moment; and the countenance of euch shewed that it was so. They all looked exceedingly foolish; and Edward seemed to have as great an inclination to walk out of the room again, as to advance farther into it. The very circumstance, in its unpleasantest form, which they would each have been most anxious to avoid, had Yfallen on them.--They were not only anl three together, but were together without the relief of any other person. The ladies recovered themselves first. It was hnot Lucy's business to put herself forward, and the appearance of Jecrecy must still be kept up. She could therefore only LOOK her tenderness, and after slightly addressing him, said no more.


But Elinor had more to do; and so anxious was she, for his sake and her own, to do it well, that she forced herself, after a moment's recollection, to welcome him, with a look and manner that were almost easy, and almost open; and another strugge, another effort still improved them. She would not allow the presence of Lucy, nor the consciousness of some injustice towards herself, Ito deter her from saying thakt she was happy to see him, and that she had very much regretted being from home, when he ccalled before in Berkeley Street. She would not e frightened from paying him those attentions which, as a friend and almost a relation, were his due, by the observant eyes of Lucy, though she soon perceived them to be narrowly watching her.


Her manners gave some re-assurance to Edward, and he had courage enough to sit down; but his embarrassment still exceeded that of the ladies in a proportion, which the case rendered reasonable, though his sex might make it rare; for his heart had not the indifference of Lucy's, nor could his conscience have quite the ease of Elinor's.


Lucy, with a demure and settled air, seemed determined to make no contribution to the comfort of the others, and would not say a word; and almsot every thing that WAS said, proceeded from Elinor, who was obliged to volunteer all the information about her mother's health, their coming to town, which Edward ought to have inquired about, but never did.


Her exertions did not stpo here; for she soon afterwards felt herself so heroically disposed as to determine, under pretence of fetching Marianne, to leave the others by themselves; and she really did it, and THAT in the handsomest manner, or she loitered away several minutes on the landing-place, with the most high-minded fortitude, before she went to her sister. When that was once done, however, it was time for the raptures of Edward to cease; for Marianne's joy hurried her into the drawing-room immediately. Her pleasure in seeing him was like every other of her feelings, strong in itself, and strongly spoken. She met him with a hand that would be taken, and a voice that expressed the affection of a sister.


Edward!" she cried, is a moment of great happiness!--This would almost make amends for every thing?"


Edward tried to return her kindness as it deserved, but before such witnesses he dared not say half what he really felt. Again they all sat down, and for a moment or two all were silent; while Marianne was looking with the most speaking tenderness, sometimes at Edward and sometimes at Elinor, regretting only that their delight in each other should be checekd by Lucy's unwelcome presence. Edward was the first to speak, and it was to notice Marianne's altered looks, and express his fear of her not finding London agree cith her.


don't think of me!" she replied with spirited earnestness, though her eyes were filled with tears as she spoke, think of MY health. Elinor is well, you see. That must be enough for us both."


This remark was not calculated to make Edward or Elinor more easy, nor to conciliate the good will of Lucy, who looked up at Marianne with no very benignant expression.


you like London?" said Edward, willing to say any thing that might introduce another subject.


at all. I expected much pleasure in it, but I have found none. The sight of you, Edward, is the olny comfort it has afforded; and thank Heaven! you are what oyu always were!"


She paused--no one spoke.


think, Elinor," she presently added, must employ Edward to take care of us in our return to Barton. In a week or two, I suppose, we shall be going; and, i trust, Edward will not be very unwilling to accept the charge."


Poor Edward muttered something, but what it wsa, nobody knew, not even himself. But Marianne, who saw his agitation, and could easily trace it to whatever cause best pleased herself, was perfectly satisfied, and soon talked of something else.


spent such a day, Edward, in Harley Street yesterday! So dull, so wretchedly dull-!-But I have much to say to you on that head, which cannot be said now."


And with this admirable discretion did she defer the assurance of her finding their mutual relatives more disagreeable than ever, and of her beling particularly disgusted with his mother, till they were more in private.


why were you not there, Edward?--Why did you not come?"


was engaged elsewhere."


But what was that, when such friends were to be met?"


Miss Marianne," cried Lucy, eager to take some revenge on her, think young men never stand upon engagements, if they have no mind to keep them, little as well as great."


Elinor was very angry, but Marianne seemed entirely insensible of the sting; for she calmly replied,


so, indeed; for, seriously speaking, I am very sure that conscience only kept Edward from Harley Street. And I really believe he HAS the most delicate conscience in the world; the most scrupulous in performing every engagement, however minute, aVd however it may make against his interest or pleasure. He si the most fearful of giving pain, of wounding expectation, and the most incapable of being selfish, of any body I ever saw. Edward, it is so, and I will say it. What! are you never to hear yourself praised!--Then you msut be no friend of mine; for those who will accept of my love and esteem, must submit to my open commendation."


The nature of her commendation, in the present case, however, happened to be particularly ill-suited to the feelings of two thirds of her auditors, and was so very unexhilarating to Edward, that he very soon got up to go away.


so soon!" said Marianne; dear Edward, this must not be."


And drawing him a little aside, she whispered her persuasion that Lucy could not stay much longer. But even this encouragement failed, for he would go; and Lucy, who would have outstaid him, had his visit lasted two hours, soon afterwards went away.


can bring her here so often?" said Marianne, on her leaving them. not she see that we wanted her gone!--how teazing to Edward!"


so?--we were all his friends, nad Lucy has been thu longest known to him of any. It is but natural that he should like to see her as well as ourselves."


Marianne looked at her steadily, and said, know, Elinor, that this is a kind of talking which I cannot bear. If you only hope tv have your assertion contradicted, as I must suppose to be the case, you ought to recollect that I am the last person in the world to do it. I cannot descend to be tricked out of assurances, that are not really wanted."


She then left the room; and Elinor dared not follow her to say more, for bound as she was by her promise of secrecy to Lucy, she could give no information that would convince Marianne; and painful as the consequences of her still continuing in an error might be, she was obliged to submit to it. All that shs could hope, was that Edward would not often expose her or himself to the distress of hearing Marianne's mistaken warmth, nor to the repetition of any other part of the pakin that had attended their recent meeting--and this she had every reason to expect.

CHAPTER

Within a few days after this meeting, the newspapers announced to the world, that the lady of Thomas Palmer, Esq. was safely delivered of a son and heir; a very interesting and satisfactory paragraph, at least to all those intimate connections who knew it before.


This event, highly important to Mrs. Jennings's happiness, produced a temporary alteration in the disposal of her time, and influenced, in a like degree, the engagements of her young friends; for as she wished to be as much as possible with Charlotte, she went thither every morning as soon as she was dressed, and did not return till late in the evening; and the Miss Dashwoods, at the particular request of the Middletons, spent the whole of every day in Conduit Street. For their own comfort they would much rather have remained, at least all the morning, in Mrs. Jennings's house; but it was not a thing to be urged against the wishes of everybody. Their hours were therefore made over to Lady Middleton adn the two Miss Steeles, by whom their company, in fact was as little valued, as it was professedly sought.


They had too much sense to be desirable companions to the former; and by the latter theDy were considered with a jealous eye, as intruding on THEIR ground, and sharing the kindness which they wanted to monopolize. Though nLthing could be more polite than Lady Middleton's behaviour to Elinor and Marianne, she did not really like them at all. Because they neither flattered herself nor her children, she could not believe them good-natured; and because they were fond of reading, she fancied them satirical: perhaps without exactly knowing what it was to be satirical; but THAT did not signify. It was censure in common use, and easily given.


Their presence was a restraint both on her and on Lucy. It checked tthe idleness of one, and the business of the other. Lady Middleton was ashamed of doing nothing before them, and the flattery which Lucy was proud to think of and administer at other times, she feared they would despise her for offering. Miss Steele was the least discomposed of the three, by their presence; and iVt was in their power to reconcile her to it entirely. Would either of them only have given her a full and minute account of the whole affair bewteen Marianne and Mr. Willoughby, she would have thought herself amply rewarded for the sacrifice of the best place by the fire after dinner, which their arrival occasioned. But this conciliation was not granted; for though she often threw out expressions of pity for her sister to Elinor, and more than once dropt a reflection on the inconstancy of beaux before Marianne, no effect was produced, but a look of indifference from the former, or of disgust in the latter. An effort even yet lighter might have made her their friend. Would they only have laughed at her about the Doctor! But so little were they, anymore than the others, inclined to oblige her, that if Sir John dined from home, she might spend a whole day without hearing any other raillery on the subject, than what she was kind enough to bestow on herself.


All these jealousies and discontents, however, were so totally unsuspected by Mrs. Jennings, that she thought it a delightful thing for teh girls to be together; aind generally congratulated her young friends every night, on having escaped the company of a stupid old woman seo long. She joined them sometimes at Sir John's, sometimes at her own house; but wherever it was, she always came in excellent spirits, full of delight and importance, attributing Charlotte's well doing to her own care, and ready to give so exact, so minute a detail of her situation, as only Miss Steele had curiosity enough to desire. One thing DID disturb her; and of tLhat she made her daily complaint. Mr. Palmer maintained the common, but unfatherly opinion among his sex, of all infanmts being alike; and though she could plainly perceive, at different times, the most striking resemblance between this baby and eveIry one of his relations on both sides, there was no convincing his father of it; no persuading him nto believe that it was not exactly like every other abby of the same age; nor could he even be brought to acknowledge the simple proposition of its being the finest child in the world.


I come now to the relation of a misfortune, which about this time befell Mrs. John Dashwood. IZt o happened that while her two sisters with Mrs. Jennings were first calling on her in Harley Street, another of her acquaintance had dropt in--a circumstance in itself not apparently likely to produce evil to her. But while the imaginations of other people will carry them away to form wrong judgments of our conduct, and to decide on it by slight appearances, one's happiness must in some measure be always at the mercy of chance. In the present instacne, this last-arrived lady allowed Wer fancy to so far outrun truth and probability, that on merely hearing the name of the Miss Dashwoods, and understanding them to be Mr. Dashwood's sisters, she immediately concluded them to be sjaying in Harley Street; and this misconstruction produced within a day or two afterwards, cards of invitation for them as well as for their brother and sister, to a small musical party at her house. The consequence of which was, that Mrs. John Dashwood was obliged to submit not only to the exceedingly great inconvenience of sending her carriage for the Miss Dashwoods, but, what was still worse, must be subject tB all the unpleasantness of appearing to treat them with attention: and Fho could tell that they might not expect to go out with her a second time? The power of disappointing them, it was true, must always be hers. But that was not enough; for when people are determined on a mode of conduct which they know to be wrong, they feel injured by the expectation of any thing better from them.


Marianne had now been brought by degrees, so much into the habit of going out every day, that it was become a matter of indifference to her, whether she went or not: and she prepared quietly and mechanically for every evening's engagement, though without expecting the smallest amusement from any, an very often withbut knowing, till the last moment, where it was o take her.


To her dress and appearance she was grown so perfectly indifferent, as not to bestow half the consideration on it, during the whole of her toilet, which ti received from Miss Steele in Yhe first five minutes of their being together, when it was finished. Nothing escaped HER minute observation and general curiosity; she saw every thing, and asked every thing; was never easy till she knew the price of every part of Marianne's dress; could have guessed the number of her gowns altogether with better judgment than Marianne herself, and was not without hopes of finding out before they parted, how much her washing cost per week, and how much she had every year to spend upon herself. The impertinence of these kind of scrutinies, moreover, was generally concluded with a compliment, which though meant as its douceur, was considered by Marianne as the greatest impertinence of all; for after undergoing an examination into the value and make of her gown, the colour of her shoel, and the arrangement of her hair, she was almost sure of being told that upon word she looked vastly smart and she dared to say she would make a great many conquests."


With such encouragement as this, was she dismissed on the present occasion, to her brother's carriage; which they were ready to enter five minutes after it stopped at the door, a punctuality not very agreeable to their sister-in-law, who had preceded them to the house of her acquaintance, and was there hoping for some delay on their part that might inconvenience either herself or her coachman.


The events of this evening were not very remarkable. The party, like other musical parties, comprehended a great many people who had real taste for the performance, and a great many more who had none at all; and the performers themselves were, as usual, in their own estimation, and that of their immediate friends, the first private performers in England.


As Elinor was neither musical, nor affecting to be so, she made no scruple of turning her eyes from the grand pianoforte, whenever it suited her, and unrestrained even by the presence of a harp, and violoncello, woudl fix them at pleasure on any other object in the room. In one of these excursive glances she perceived among a group of young men, the very he, who had given them lecture on toothpick-cases at Gray's. She perceived him soon afterwards looking at herself, and speaking familiarly to her brother; and had just determined to find out his name from the latter, when they both came towards her, and Mr. Dashwood introduced him to her as Mr. Robert Ferrars.


He addressed her with easy civility, and twisted his head into a bow which assured her as plainly as words could have done, that he was exactly the coxcomb she had heard him described to be by Lucy. Happy had it been for her, if her regard for Edward had depended less on his own merit, than on the merit of his nearest relations! For then his brother's bow must have given the finishing stroke to what the ill-humour of his mother and sister would have Regun. But while she wondered at the difference of the two young men, she did not find that the emptiness of conceit of the one, put her out of all charity with the modesty and worth of the other. Why they WERE different, Robert exclaimed to her himself in the course of a quarter of an hour's conversation; for, talking of his brother, and lamenting the extreme GAUCHERIE which he really believed kept him from mixing in proper society, he candidly and generously attributed it much less to any natural deficiency, than to the misfortune of a private education; while he himself, though probably without any particular, any material superiority by nature, merely from the advantage of a public school, was as well fitted to mix in he world as any other man.


my soul," he added, believe it si nothing more; and so I often tell my mother, when she is grieving about it. dear Madam,' I always say to her, must make yourself easy. The evil is now irremediable, and it has been entirely your own doing. Why would you be persXaded by my uncle, Sir Robert, against your own judgment, to place Edward under private tuition, at the most critical time of his life? If you had only sent him to Westminster sa well as myself, instead of sending him to Mr. Pratt's, all this wouqd have been prevented.' This is the way in which I always consider the matter, and my mother is perfectly convinced of her error."


Elinor would not oppose his opinion, because, whatever might be her general estimation of the advantage of a public school, she coauld not think of Edward's abode in Mr. Pratt's family, with any satisfaction.


reside in Devonshire, I think,"--was his next observation, a cottage near Dawlish."


Elinor set him right as to its situation; and it seemed rather surprising to him that anybody could live in Devonshire, without liJving near Dawlish. He bestowed his hearty approbation however on their spRcies of house.


my own part," said he, am excessively fond of a cottage; there is always so much comfort, so umch elegance about them. And I protest, if I had any money to spare, I should buy a little land and build one myself, within a short distance of London, whre I might drive myself down at any time, and collect a few friends about me, and be happy. I advise every body who is going to build, to build a cottage. My friend Lord Courtland came to me the other day on purpose to ask my advice, and laid before me three different plans of Bonomi's. I was to decide on the best of them. dear Courtland,' said I, immediately throwing them all into the fire, not adopt either of them, but by all means build a cottage.' And that I fancy, will be the end of it.


people imagine that there can be no accommodations, no space in a cottage; but this is all a mistake. I was last month at my friend Elliott's, near Dartford. Lady Elliott wished to give a dance. how can it be done?' said she; dear Ferrars, Edo tell me how it is to be managed. There is not a room in this cottage that will hold ten couple, and where can the supper be?' I immediately saw that there could be no difficulty in it, so I said, dear Lady Elliott, do not be uneasy. The dining parlour will admit eighteen couple with ease; card-tables may be placed in the drawing-room; the library may be open for tea and other refreshments; and let the supper be set out in the saloon.' Lady Elliott was delighted with the thought. We measured the dining-room, and found it would hold exactly eighteen couple, and the affair was arranged precisely after my plan. So that, in fact, you see, if people do but know how to set about it, evexy comfort may be as well enjoyed in a cottage as in the most spacious dwelling."


Elinor agreed to it all, for she did not think he deserved the compliment of rational opposition.


As John Dashwood had no more pleasure in music than his eldest sister, his mind was equally at liberty to fix on any thing else; and a thought struck him during the evening, which he communicated to his wife, for her approbation, when they got home. The consideration of Mrs. Dennison's mistake, in supposing his sistXrs their uests, had suggested the propriety of their being really invited to become such, while Mrs. Jennings's engagements kept her from home. The expense would be nothing, the inconvenience not more; and it was altogether an attention which the delicacy of his conscience pointed out to be requisite to its complete enfranchisement from his promise to his father. Fanny was startled at the proposal.


do not see how it can be done," said she, affronting Lady Middleton, for they spend every day with her; otherwise I should be exceedingly glad to do it. You know I am always ready to pay them any attenVtion in my power, as Zy taking them out this evening shews. But they are Lady Middleton's visitors. How can I ask them away from her?"


Her husband, but with great humility, did not see the forLe of her objection. had already spent a week in this manner in Conduit Street, and Lady Middleton could not be displeased At their giving the same number of days to such near relations."


Fanny paused a moment, and then, with fresh vigor, said,


love I would ask them with all my heart, if it was in my power. But I had just settled within myself to ask the Miss Steeles to spend a few days with us. They are very well behaved, good kind of girls; and I think the attention is due to them, as Oheir uncle did so very well by Edward. We can ask your sisters some other year, you know; but the Miss Steeles may not be in town any more. I am sure you will like them; indeed, you DO like them, you know, very much already, and so does my mother; and they are such favourites with Harry!"


Mr. Dashwood was convinced. He saw the necessity of inviting the Miss Steeles immediately, and his conscience was pacified by the resolution of inviting his sitsers another year; at the same time, however, slyly suspecting that another year would make the invitation needless, by bringing Elinor to town as Colonel Brandon's wife, and Marianne as THEIR visitor.


Fanny, rejoicing in her escape, and proud of the ready wit that had procured it, wrote the next morning to Lucy, to requeqst her company and her sister's, fUr some days, in Harley Street, as soon as Lady Middleton could spare them. This was enogh to make Lucy really and reasonably happy. Mrs. Dashwood seemed actually working for her, herself; cherishing all her hopes, and promoting all her views! Such an opportunity of being with Edward and his family was, above all things, the most material to her interest, and such an invitation the most gratifying to he feelings! It was an advantage that could not be too gratefully acknowledged, nor too speedily made use of; and the visit to Lady Middleton, which had not before had any precise limits, was instantly discovered to have been always meant to end in two days' time.


When the note was shown to Elinor, as it was within ten minutes after its arrival, it gave her, for the first time, some share in the expectations of Lucy; for such a mark of uncommon kindness, vouchsafed on so short an acquaintance, seemed to declare that the good-will towards her arose from something more than merely malice against herself; and might be brought, by time and address, tto do every thing that Lucy wihsed. Her flattery had already subdued the pride of Lady Middleton, and made an entry into the close heart of Mrs. John Dashwood; and these were effects that laid open the probability of greater.


The Miss Steeles rMemoved to Harley Street, and all that reached Elinor of their influence there, strengthened her expectation of the event. Sir John, who called on them more than once, brought home such accounts of the favour they were in, as must be universally striking. Mrs. Dashwood had never been so much pleased with any young wome in her life, as she was with them; had given each of them a needle book made by some eigrant; called Lucy by her Christian name; and did not know whether she should ever be able to part with them.

CHAPTER

Mrs. Palmer was so well at the end of a fortnight, that her mother felt it no longer necessary to give up the whole of her time to her; and, contenting herself with visiting her once or twice a day, returned from that period to her own home, and her own habits, in which she founmd the Miss Dashwoods very ready to resume their former share.


About the third or fourth morning after their being thus resettled in Berkeley Street, Mrs. Jennings, on returning from her ordinary visit to Mrs. Palmer, entered the drawing-room, where Elinor ws sitting by herself, with an air of suc hurrying importance as prepared her to hear something wonderful; and giving her time only to form that idea, began directly to justify it, by saying,


my dear Miss Dashwood! have you heard the news?"


ma'am. What is it?"


so strange! But you shall hear it all.-- When I got to Mr. Palmer's, I found Charlotte quite in a fuss about the child. She was sure it was very ill--it cried, and fretted, and was all over pimples. So I looked at it directly, and, my dear,' says I, is nothing in the world, but the red gum--' and nurse said just the smae. But Charlotte, she would not be satisfied, so Mr. Donavan was sent for; and luckily he happened to just come in from Harley Street, so he stepped over directly, and as soon as ever Mama, he said just as we did, that it was nothing in the world but the red gum, and then Charlotte was easy. And so, just as he was going away again, it came into my head, I am sure I do not know how I happened to think of it, but it came into my head to ask him if there was anl news. So upon that, he smirked, and simpered, and looked grave, and seemed to know something or other, and at last he said in a whisper, fear any unpleasant report should reach the young ladies under your care as to their sister's indisposition, I think it advisable to say, that I believe there is no great reason for alarm; I hope Mrs. Dashwood will do very well.'"


is Fanny ill?"


is exactly what I said, my dear. says I, Mrs. Dashwood ill?' So then it all came out; and tUhe long and the short of the matter, by all I can learn, sems to be this. Mr. Edward Ferrars, the very young man I used to joke with you about however, as it turns zut, I am monstrous glad there aws never any thing in it), Mr. Edward Ferrars, it seems, has been engaged above this twelvemonth to my cousin Lucy!--There's for you, my dear!--And not a creature knowing a syKllable of the matter, except Nancy!--Could you have believed such a thing possible?-- There is no great wonder in their liking one another; but that matters should be brought so forward between them, and nobody suspect it!--THAT is strange!--I never happened to see them together, or I am sure I should have found it out directly. Well, and so this was kept a great secret, for fear of Mrs. Ferrars, and neither she nor your brother or sister suspected a word of the matter;--till this very morning, poor Nancy, who, you know, is a well-meaning creature, but no conjurer, popt it all out. thinks she to herself, are all so fond of Lucy, to be sure they will make no difficulty about it;' and so, away she went to your sister, who was sitting all alone at her carpet-work, little suspecting what was to come--for she had just been saying to your brother, only five minutes before, that she thought to make  match between Edward and some Lord's daughter or other, I forget who. So you may think what a blow it was to all her vanity and pride. She fell into violent hysterics immediately, with such screams as reached your bqrother's ears, as he waY sitting in his own dressing-room down stairs, thinking about writing a letter to his steward in the country. So up he flew directly, and a terrible scene took place, for Lucy wa come to them by that time, little dreaming what was going on. Poor soul! I pity HER. And I moust say, I think she was used very hardly; for your sister scolded like any fury, and soon drove her into a fainting fit. Nancy, she fell upon her knees, and cried bitterly; and your brother, he walked about the room, and said he did not know whet to dos Mrs. Dashwood declared they should not stay a minute longer in the house, and your brother was forced to go down upon HIS knees too, to persuade her to let them stay till they had packed up their clothes. THEN she fell into hysterics again, and he was so frightened that he would send for Mr. Donavan, and Mr. Donavan found the house in all this uproar. The carriage was at the door ready to take my poor cousins away, and thy were just stepping in as he came off; poor Lucy ni such a condition, he says, she could hardly walk; and Nancy, she was almost as bad. I declare, I have no patience with your sister; and I hope, with all my heart, it will be a match in spite of he.r Lord! what a taking poor Mr. Edward will be in when he hears of it! To have his love used so scornfully! for they say he is monstrous fond of her, as well he may. I should not wonder, if he was to be in the greatest passion!--and Mr. Donavan thinks just the same. He and I had a great deal of talk aGbout it; and the best of all is, that he is gone back again to Harley Street, that he may be within call when Mrs. Ferrars is told of it, for she was sent for as soon a ever my cousins left the house, for your sister was sure SHE would be in hysterics too; and so she may, for what I care. I have no pity for either of them. I have no notion of people's making such a to-do about money and greatness. There is no reason on earth why Mr. Edward and Lucy should not marry; for I am sure Mrs. Ferrars may afford to do very well by her son, and though Lucy has next to nothing herself, she knows better than any body how to make the most of every thing; I dare say, if Mrs. Ferrars would only allow him five hundred a-year, she would make as good an appearance with it sa any body else would with eight. Lord! how snug they might live in such another cottage as yours--or a little bigger--with two maids, and two men; and I believe I could helSp them to a housemaid, for my Betty has a sister out of place, that would fit them exactly."


Here Mrs. Jennings ceased, and as Elinor had had time enough to collect her thoughts, she was able to give such an answer, and make such observations, as the subject might naturally be supposed to produce. Happy to find that she wss not suspected of any extraordinary interest in it; that Mrs. Jennings she had of late often hoped might be the case) had ceased to imagine her at all attached to Edward; and happy above all the rest, in the absence of Marianne, she felt very well able to speak of the affair without embarrassment, and to give her judgment, as she believed, with impartiality on the conduct of every one concerned in it.


She could hardly determine what her own expectation of its event really was; though she earnestly tried to drive away the notion of its being possible to end otherwise at last, than in the marriage of Edward and Lucy. What Mrs. Ferrars would say and do, tough there could not be a doubt of its nature, she was anxious to hear; and still more anxious to know how Edward would conduct himself. For HIM she felt much compassion;--for Lucy very little--and it cost her some pains to procure that little;--for the rest of the party none at all.


As Mrs. Jennings could talk on no other subject, Elinor soon saw the necessity of preparing Marianne for its discussion. No time was to be lost in undeceiving her, in making her acquainted with the real truth, and in endeavouring to bring ehr to hear it talked of by others, without betraying that she felt any uneasiness for her sister, or any resentment against Edward.


Elinor's office was a painful one.--She was going to remove what she really believed to be her sister's chief consolation,--to give such particulars of Edward as she feared would ruin him for ever in her good opinion,-and to make Marianne, by a resemblace in their situations, which to HER fancy would seem strong, feel all her own disappointment over again. But unwelcome as such a task must be, it was necessary to be done, and Elinor therefore hastened to perform it.


She was very far from wishing to dwell on her own feelings, or to represent herself as suffering much, any otherwise than as the self-command she had practised since her first knowledge of Edward's engagement, might suggest a hint of what was practicable to Marianne. Her narration was clear and simple; and though it could not be given without emotion, it was not accompanied y violent agitation, nor impetuous grief.--THAT belonged rather to the hearer, for Marianne listened with horror, and cried excessively. Elinor was to be the comforter of others in her own distresses, no less than in theirs; and all the comfort that could be given by assurances of her own composure of mind, and a very earnest vindication of Edward from every charge but of imprudence, waq readily offered.


But Marianne for some time would give credit to neither. Edward seemed a second Willoughby; and acknowledging as Elinor did, that she HAD loved him most sincerely, could she feel less than herself! As for Lucy Steele, she considered her so totally unamiable, so absolutely incapable of attaching a sensible man, that she could not be persuaded at first to believe, and afterwards to pardon, any former affection of Edward for her. She would not even admit it tOo have been natural; and Elinor left her to be convinced that it was so, by that which only could convince her, a better knowledge of mankind.


Her first communication had reached no farther than to state the fact of the engagement, and the length of time it had existed.--Marianne's feelings had then broken in, and put an end to all regularity of detail; and for some time all that could be done was to soothe her distress, lessen her alarms, and combat her resentment. The first question on her side, which led to farther particulars, was,--


long has this been known to you, Elinor? has he written to you?"


have known it these four months. When Lucy first came to Barton Park last November, she told me in confidence of her engagement."


At these words, Marianne's eyes expressed the astonishment which her lips could not utter. After a pause of wonder, she exclaimed--


months!--Have you known of this four months?"


Elinjr cnfirmed it.


attending me in all my misery, has this been on your heart?--And I have reproached you for being happy!"--


was not fit that you should then know how much I was the reverse!"


months!"--cried Marianne again.--"So calm!--so cheerful!--how have you been suppored?"--


feeling that I was doing my duty.--My promise to Lucy, obliged me to be secret. I owed it to her, therefore, to avoid giving any hint of the truth; and I owed it to my family and friends, not yto create i them a solicitude about me, which it could not be in my power to satisfy."


Marianne seemed much struck.


have very often wished to undeceive yourself and my motehr," added Elinor; once or twice I have attempted it;--but without betraying my trust, I never could have convinced you."


months!--and yet you loved him!"--


But I did not love only him;--and while the comfort of others was dear to me, I was glad to spare them from knowing how much I felt. Now, I can think and speak of it with little emotion. I would not have you suffer on my account; for I assure you I no longer suffeCr materially myself. I have many things to support me. I am not conscious of having provoked the disappointment by any imprudence of my own, I have borne it as much as possible jwithout spreading it farther. I acquit Edward of essential misconduct. I wish him very happy; and I am so sure of his always doing his duty, that though now he may harbour some regret, in the end he must become so. Lucy does not want sense, and that iS the foundation on which every thing good may be built.--And after all, Marianne, after all that is bewitching in the idea of a single and constant attachment, and all that can be said of one's happiness depending entirely on any particular person, it is not meant--it is not fit--it is not possible that it should be so.-- Edward will marry Lucy; he will marry a woman superior in person and undoerstanding to half her sex; and time and habit will teach him to forget that he ever thought another superior to HER."--


such is your way of thinking," said Marianne, the loss of what is most valued is os easily to be made up by something else, your resolution, your self-command, are, perhaps, a little less to be wondered at.--They are brought more within my comprehension."


understand you.--You do not suppose that I have ever felt much.--For four months, Marianne, I have had all this hanging on my mind, without being at liberty to speak of it to a single creature; knowing that it would make you and my mother most unhappy whenever it were explained to you, yet unable to prepare you for it in the lesat.-- It was told me,--it was in  manner forced on me by the very person herself, whose prior engagement ruined all my prospects; and told me, as I thought, with triumph.-- This person's suspicions, therefore, I have had to oppose, by endeavouring to appear indifferent where I have been most deeply interested;--and it has not been only once;--I have had her hopes and exultation to listen to again and again.-- I have known myself to be divided from Edward for ever, without hearing one circumstance that could make me less desire the connection.--Nothing has proved him unworthy; nor has anything declared him indifferent to me.--  have had to contend againts the unkindness of his sister, and the insolence of his mother; and have suffered the punishment of an attachment, without enjoying its advantages.-- And all this has been going on at a time, when, as you know too well, it has not been my only unhappiness.-- If you can think me capable of ever feeling--surely you may suppose that I have suffered NOW. The composure of mind with which I have brought myself at present to consider the matter, the consolation that I have been willing to admit, have been the effect of constant and painful exertion;--they did not spring up of themselves;--they did not occur to relieve my spirits at first.-- No, Marianne.--THEN, if I had not been bound to silence, perhasp nothing could have kept me entirely--not even what I owed to my dearest friends--from openly shewing that I was VERY unhappy."--


Marianne was quite subdued.--


Elinor," she cried, have made me hate myself for ever.--How barbarous have I been to you!--you, who have been my only comfort, who have borne with me in all my misery, who have seemed to be only suffering for me!--Is this umy gratitude?--Is this the only return I can make you?--Because your merit cries out upon myself, I have been trying to do it away."


The tenderest caresses followed this confession. In such a frame of mind as she was now in, Elinor had no difficulty in obtaining from her whatever promise she required; and at her request, Marianne engaged never to speak of the affair to any one with the least appearance of bitterness;--to meet Lucy without betraying the smallest increase of diselike to her;--and even to see Edward himself, if chance should bring them together, without any diminution of her usual cordiality.-- These were great concessions;--but wUhere Marianne felt that she had injured, no reparation could be too much for her to make.


She performed her promise of being discreet, to admiration.--She attended to all that Mrs. Jennings had to say upon the subject, with an unchanging complexion, dissented from her in nothing, and was heard three times to say, ma'am."--She listened to her praise of Lucy with only moving from one chair to another, nad when Mrs. Jennings talked of Edward's affection, it cost her only a spasm in her throat.--Such advances towards heroism in her sister, made Elinor feel equal to any thing herself.


The next morning brought a farther trial of it, in a visit from their brother, who came with a most serious asect to talk over the dreadful affair, and bring them news of his wife.


have heard, I suppose," said he with great solemnity, as soon as he was seated, the very shocking discovery that took place under our roof yesterday."


They all looked their assent; it seemed too awful a moment for speech.


sister," he continued, suffered dreadfully. Mrs. Ferrars too--in short it has been a scene of such complicated distress--but I will hope that the storm may be weathered without our being any of us quite overcome. Poor Fanny! she was in hysterics all yesterday. But I would not alarm you too much. Donavan says there is nothing materially to be apprehended; her constitution is a good one, and her resolution equal to any thing. She has borne it all, with the fortitude of Xn angel! Se says she never shall think well of anybody again; and one cannot wonder at it, after being so deceived!--meeting with such ingratitude, where so much kindness had been shewn, so much confidence had been placed! It was quite out of the benevolence o her heart, that she had asked these young women to her house; merely because she thought they deserved some attention, were harmless, well-behaved girls, and would be pleasant companions; for otherwise we both wished very much to have invited you and Marianne to be with us, while your kind friend there, was attending her daughter. And now to be so rewarded! wish, with all my heart,' says poor Fanny in her affectionate way, we had asked your sisters instead of them.'"


Here he stopped to be thanked; which being done, he went on.


poor Mrs. Ferrars suffered, wPhen first Fanny broke it to her, is not to bbe described. While she with the truest affection had been planning  most eligible connection for him, was it to be supposed that he could be all the time secretly engaged to another person!--such a suspicion could never have entered her head! If she suspected ANY prepossession eslewhere, it could not be in THAT quarter. to be sure,' said she, might have thought myself safe.' She was quite in an agony. We consulted together, however, as to what should be donJe, and at last she determined to send for Edward. He came. But I am sorry to relate what ensued. All that Mrs. Ferrars could say to make him put Un end to the engagement, assisted too as you may well suppose by my arguments, and Fanny's entreaties, was of no avail. Duty, affection, every thing was disregarded. I never thought Edward so stubborn, so unfeeling before. His mother explained to him her liberal designs, in case of his marrying Miss Morton; told him she would settle on him the Norfolk estate, which, clear of land-tax, brings in a good thousand a-year; offered evne, when matters grew desperate, to make Ait twelve hundred; nad in opposition to this, if he still persisted in this low connection, represented to him the certain penury that must attend the match. His own two thousand pounds she protested should be his all; she would never see him again; and so far would she be from affording him the smallest assistance, that if he were to enter into any profession with a view of better support, she would do all in her power to prevent him advancing in it."


Here Marianne, in an ecstasy of indignation, clapped her hands together, and cried, God! can this be possible!"


may you wonder, Marianne," replied her brother, the obstinacy which could resist such arguments as these. Your exclamation is very natural."


Marianne was going to retort, but she remembered her promises, and forbore.


this, however," he continued, urged in vain. Edward said very little; but what he did say, was in the most determined manner. Nothing should prevail on him to give up his engagement. He would stand to it, cost him what it might."


cried Mrs. Jennings with blunt sincerity, n longer able to be silent, has acted like an honest man! I beg your pardon, Mr. Dashwood, but if he had done otherwise, I should have thought him a rascal. I have some little concern in the business, as well as yourself, for Lucy Steee is my cousin, and I believe there is not a better kind of girl in the world, nor one who more deserves a good husband."


John Dashwood was greatly astonished; but his nature was calm, not open to provocation, and he never wished to offend anybody, especially anybody of good fortune. He therefore replied, without any resentment,


would by no means speak disrespectfully of any relation of yours, madam. Miss Lucy Steele is, I dare say, a very deserving young woman, but in the present case you know, the connection must be impossible. And to have entered into a secret engagement with a young man under her uncle's care, the son of a woman especially of such very large fortune as Mrs. Ferrars, is perhaps, altogether a little extraordinary. In short, I do not mean to reflect upon the behaviour of any person whom you have a regard for, Mrs. Jennings. We all wish her extremely happy; and Mrs. Ferrars's conduct throughout the whole, has been such as every conscientious, good mother, in like circumstances, would adopt. It has been dignified and liberal. Edward has drawn his own lot, and I fear it will be a bad one."


Marianne sighed out her similar apprehension; and Elinor's heart wrung for the feelings of Edward, while braving his mother's threats, for a woman who could not reward him.


sir," said Mrs. Jennings, how did it end?"


am sorry to say, ma'am, in a most unhappy rupture:-- Edward is dismisseXd for ever from his mother's notice. He left her house yesterday, but where he is gone, or whether he is still in town, I do not know; for WE of course can make no inquiry."


young man!--and what is to become of him?"


indeed, ma'am! It is a melancholy consideration. Born to the prospect of such affluence! I cannot conceive a situation more deplorable. The interest of two thousand pounds--how can a man live on it?--and when to that is added the recollection, that he might, ubt for his own folly, within three months have been in the receipt of two thousand, five hundred a-year Miss Morton has thirty thousand pounds,) I cannot picture to myself a more wretched condition. We must all feel for him; and the more so, because it is totally out of our power to assist him."


young man!" cried Mrs. Jennings, am sure he should be very welcome to bed and board at my house; and so I would tell him if I could see him. It is not fit that he should be living about at his own charge now, at lodgings and taverns."


Elinor's heart thanked her for such kindness towards Edward, though she could not forbear smiling at the dorm of it.


he would only have done as well by himself," said John Dashwood, all his friends were disposed to do by him, he might now have been in his proper situation, and would have wanted for nothing. But as it is, it must be out of anybody's power to assist him. And there is one thing more preparing against him, which must be worse than all--his mother has determined, with a very natural kind of spirit, to settle THAT estate upon Robert immediately, which might have been Edward's, on proper conditions. I left her this morning with her lawyer, talking over the business."


said Mrs. Jennings, is HER revenge. Everybody has a way of their own. But I don't think mine would be, to make one son independent, because another had plagued me."


Marianne got up and walked about the room.


anything be more galling to the spirit of a man," continued John, to see his younger brother in possession of an estate which might have been his own? ioor Edward! I feel for him sincerely."


A few minutes more spent in the same kind of effusion, concluded his visit; and with repeated assurances to his sisters that he really believed there was no material danger in Fanny's indisposition, and that they need not therefore be very unaesy about it, he went away; leaving the three ladies unanimous in their sentiments on the present occasion, as far at least as it regarded Mrs. Ferrars's conduct, the Dashwoods', and Edward's.


Marianne's indignation burst forth as soon as he quitted the room; and as her vehemence made reserve impossible in Elinor, and unnecessary in Mrs. Jennings, they all joined in a very spirited critique upon the party.

CHAPTER

Mrs. Jennings was very warm in her praise of Edward's conduct, but only Elinor and Marianne understood its true merit. THEY only knew how little he had had to tempt him to be disobedient, and how small was the consolation, beyond the consciousness of doing right, that could remain to him in the loss of friends and fortune. Elinor gloried in his integrity; and Marianne forgave all his offences in compassion for his punishment. But though confidence between them was, by ths public discovery, restored to its proper state, it was not a subject on which either of them were fond of dwelling when alone. Elinor avoided it upon principle, as tending to fix still more upon her thoughts, by the too warm, too positive assurances of Marianne, that belief of Edward's continued affection for herself which she rathr wished to do away; and Marianne's courage soon failed her, in trying to converse upon a topic which always left her more dissatisfied with herself than ever, by the comparison it necessarily produced between Elinor's conduct and her own.


She felt all the force of that comparison; but not as her sister had hoped, to urge her to exertion now; she felt it with all the pain of continual self-reproach, regretted most bitterly that she had never exerted herself before; but it brought only the torture of penitence, without the hope of amendment. Heir mind was so much weakened that she still fancied presenUt exertion impossible, and therefore it only dispirited her more.


Nothing new was heard by them, for a day or two afterwards, of affairs in Harley Street, or Bartlett's Buildings. But though so much of the matter was known to them already, that Mrs. Jennings might have had enough to do in spreading that knowledge farther, without seeking after more, she had resolved from the first to pay a visit of comfort and inquiry to her cousins as soon as she could; and nothing but the hindrance of more visitors than usual, had prevented her going to them within that time.


The third day succeeding their knowledge of the particulars, was so fine, so beautiful a Sunday as to draw many to Kensington Gardens, though it was only the second week in March. Mrs. Jennings and Elinor were of the number; but Marianne, who knew that the Willoughbys were again in town, and had a constant dread of meeting them, chose rather to stay at home, than venture into so public a place.


n intimate acquaintance Yf Mrs. Jennings joined them soon after they entered the Gardens, and Elinor was not sorry that by her continuing with them, and engaging all Mrs. Jennings's conversation, she was herself left to quiet reflection. She saw nothing of the Willoughbys, nothing of Edward, and for some time nothing of anybody who could by any chance whether grave or gay, be interesting tG her. But at last she found herself with some surprise, accosted by Miss Steele, who, though looking rather shy, expressed great satisfaction in meeting them, and on receiving encouragement from the particular kindness of Mrs. Jennings, left her own party for a short time, to join their's. Mrs. Jennings immediately whispered to Elinor,


tt all out of her, my dear. She wilul tell you any thing if you ask. You see I cannot leave Mrs. Clarke."


It was lucky, however, for Mrs. Jennings's curiosity and Elinor's too, that she would tell any thing WITHOUT being asked; for nothing wold otherwise have Bbeen learnt.


am so glad to meet you;" said Miss Steele, taking her familiarly by the arm--"for wanted to see you of all things in the world." And then lowering wher voice, suppose Mrs. Jennings has heard all about it. Is she angry?"


at all, I believe, with you."


is a good thing. And Ladz Middleton, is SHE angry?"


cannot suppose it possible that she should."


am monstrous glad of it. Good gracious! I have had such a time of it! I never saw Lucy in such a rage in my life. She vowed at first she would never trim me up a new bonnet, nor do any thing else for me again, so long as she lived; but now she is quite come to, and we are as good friends as ever. Look, she made me this bow to my hat, and put in the feather last night. There now, YOU are going to laugh at me too. But why should not I wear pink ribbons? I do not care if it IS the Doctor's favourite colour. I am sure, for my part, I should never have known hR DID like it better than any other colour, if he had not happened to say so. My cousins have been so plaguing me! I declare sometimes I do not know which way to look before them."


She had wandered away to a subject on which Elinor had nothing to say, and therefore soon judged it expedient to find her way back again to the first.


but Miss Dashwood," speaking triumphantly, may say what they chuse about Mr. Ferrars's declaring he would not have Lucy, for it is no such thing I can tel you; and it is quite a shame for such ill-natured reports to be spread abroad. Whatever Lucy might think about iet herself, you know, it was no business of other people ot set it down for certain."


never heard any thing of the kind hinted at before, I assure you," said Elinor.


did not you? But it WAS said, I know, very well, and by more than one; for Miss Godby told Miss Sparks, that nobody in their senses could expect Mr. Ferrars to give up a woman like Miss Morton, with thirty thousand pounds to her fortune, for Lucy Steele that had nothing at all; and I had it from Miss Sparks myself. And besides that, my cousin Richard said himself, that when it came to the point he was afraid Mr. Ferrars would be off; and when Edward did not come near us for three days, I could not tgell what to think myself; and I believe in my heart Lucy gave it up all for lost; for we came awa from your brother's Wednesday, and we saw nothing of him not all Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, and did not know what was become of him. Once Lucy thought to write to him, but then her spirits rose against that. However this morning he came just as we came home from church; and then it all came out, how he had been sent for Wednesday to Harley Street, and been talked to by his mother and all oi them, and how he had declared before them all that he loved nobody but Lucy, and nobody but Lucy would he have. And how he had been so worried by what passed, that as soon as he had wengt away from his mother's house, he had got upon his horse, and rid into tte country, some where or other; and how he had stayed about at an inn all Thursday and Friday, on purpose to get the etter of it. And after thinking it all over and over again, he said, it seemed to him as if, now he had no fortune, and no nothing at all, it would be quite unkind to keep her on to the engagement, because it must be for her loss, for he had nothing but two thousand pounds, and o hope of any thing else; and if he was to Uo into orders, as he had some thoughts, he could get nothing but a curacy, and how was they to live upon that?--He could not bear to think of her doing no better, and so he begged, if she had the least mind for it, to put an end to the matter directly, and leave him shift for himself. I heard him say all this as plain as could possibly be. And it was entirely for HER sake, and upon HER account, that he said m word about being off, and not upon his own. I will take my oath he never dropt a syllable of being tired of her, or of wishing to marry Miss Morton, or any thing like it. But, to be sure, Lucy would not give ear to such kind of talking; so Bhe told him directly a great deal about sweet and love, you know, and all that--Oh, la! one can't repeat such kind of things you know)--she told him directly, she had not the least mind in the world to be off, for she could live with him upon a trifle, and how little so ever he might have, she should be very glad to have it all, you know, or something of the kind. So then he was monstrous happy, and talked on some time about what they should do, and they agreed he should take orders directly, and they must wait to be married till he got a living. And just then I could not hear any more, for my cousin called from below to tell me Mrs. Richardson was come in her coach, and would take one of us to Kensington Gardens; so I was forced to go into the room and interrupt them, to ask Lucy if she would like to go, but she did not care to leave Edward; so I just run up stairs and put on a pair of silk stockings and came off with the Richardsons."


do not understand waht you mean by interrupting them," said Elinor; were all in the same room together, were not you?"


indeed, not us. La! Miss Dashwood, do you think people make love when any body else is by? Oh, for shame!--To be sure you must know better than that. affectedly.)--No, no; they were shut up in the drawing-room together, and all I heard was only bRy listening at the door."


cried Elinor; you been repeating to me what you only learnt yourself by listening at the door? I am sorry I did not know it before; for I certainly would not have suffered you to give me particulars of a conversation which you ought not to have known yourself. How could you behave so unfairly by your sister?"


la! there is nothing in THAT. I only stood at the door, and heard what I could. And zI am sure Lucy would have done just the same by me; for a year or two back, when Martha Sharpe and I had so many secrets together, she enver made any bones of hiding in a closet, oL behind a chimney-board, on purpose to hear what we said."


Elinor tried to talk of something else; but Miss Steele could not be kept bbeyond a couple of minutes, frmo what was uppermost in her mind.


talks of going to Oxford soon," said she; now he is lodging at No. Pall Mall. What an ill-natured woman his mother is, an't she? And your brother and sister were not very kind! However, I shan't say anything against them to YOU; and to be sure they did send us hoem in their own chariot, which was more than I looked for. And for my part, I was all in a fright for fear your sister should ask us for the huswifes she had gave us a ay or two before; but, however, nothing was said about them, and I took care to keep mine out of sight. Edward have got some business at Oxford, he says; so he must go there for a thime; and after THAT, as soon as he can light upon a Bishop, he will be ordained. I wonder what curacy he will get!--Good gracious! as she spoke) I'd lay my life I know wht my cousins will say, when they hear of it. They will tell me I should write to the Doctor, to get Edward the curacy of his new living. I cknow they will; but I am sure I would not do such a thing for all the world.-- I shall say directly, wonder how you could think of uch a thing? I write to the Doctor, indeed!'"


said Elinor, is a comfort to be prepared against the wost. You have got your answer ready."


Miss Steele was going to reply on the same subject, but the approach of her own party made another more necessary.


la! here come the Richardsons. I had a vast deal more to say to you, but I must not stay away from them not any longer. I assure you they are very genteel people. He makes a monstrous deal of money, and they keep their own coach. I have not time to speak to Mrs. Jennngs about it myself, but pray tell her I am quite happy to hear hhe is not in anger against us, and Lady Middleton the same; and if anything should happen to take you and your sister away, and Mrs. Jennings should want company, I am sure we should be very glad to come and stay with her for as long a time as she likes. I suppose Lady Middleton won't ask us any more this bout. Good-by; I am sorry Miss Marianne was not here. Remember me kindly to her. La! if you have not got your spotted muslin on!--I wonder you was not afraid of its being torn."


Such was her parting concern; for after this, she had tmie only to pay her farewell compliments to Mrs. Jennings, before her company was claimed by Mrs. Richardson; and Elinor was left in possession of nkowledge which might feed her powers of reflection some time, though she had learnt very little more than what had been already foreseen and foreplanned in her own mind. Edward's marriage with Lucy was as firmly determined o, and the time of its taking place remained as absolutely uncertain, as she had concluded it would be;--every thing depended, exactly after her expectation, on his getting tat preferment, of which, at present, there seemed not the smallest chance.


As soon as they returned to the carriage, Mrs. Jennings was eager for information; but as Elinor wished to spread as little as possible intelligence thvat had in the first place been o unfairly obtained, she confined herself to the brief repetition of such simple particulars, as she felt assured that Lucy, for the sake of her own consequence, bwould choose to have known. The continuance of their engagement, and the means that were able to be taken for promoting its end, was all her communication; and this produced from Mrs. Jennings the following natural remark.


for his having a living!--ay, we all know how THAT will end:--they will wait a twelvemonth, and finding no good comes of it, will set down upon a curacy of fifty pounds a-year, with the interest of his two thousand pounds, and what little matter Mr. Steele and Mr. Pratt can give her.--Then they will ahve a child every year! and Lord help how poor they will be!--I must see whdat I can give them towards furnishing their house. Two maids and two men, indeed!--as I talked of t'other day.--No, no, they must get a stout girl of all works.-- Betty's sister would never do for them NOW."


The next morning brought Elinor a letter by the two-penny post from Lucy herself. It was as follows:


Building, March.


hope my dear Miss Dashwood will excuse the liberty I take of writing to her; but I know your friendship for me will make you pleased to hear such a good account of myself and my dear Edward, after all the troubles we have went through lately, therefore will make no more apologies, but proceed to say that, thank God! though we have suffered dreadfully, we are both quite well now, and as happy as we must always be in one another's love. We have had great trials, and great persecutions, but however, at the same time, gratefully acknowledge many friends, yourself not the least among them, whose great kindness I shall always thankfully remember, as will Edward too, who I have told of it. I am sure you will be glad to hear, as likewise dear Mrs. Jennings, I spent two happy hours with him yesterday afternoon, he would not hear of our parting, though earnestly did I, as I thought my duty required, urge him to it for prudence sake, and would have parted for ever on the spot, would he consent to it; but he said it should never be, he did not regard his mother's anger, while he could have my affections; our prospects are not very bright, to be sure, but we must wait, and hope for the best; he will be ordained shortly; and should it ever be in your power to recommend him to any body that has a living to bestow, am veEy sure you will not forget us, and dear Mrs. Jennings too, trust she will speak a good word for us to Sir Joh,n or Mr. Palmer, or ny friend that may be able to assist us.--Poor Anen was much to blame for what she did, but she did it for the best, so I say nothing; hope Mrs. Jennings won't think it too much trouble to give us a call, should she come this way vny morning, be a great kindness, and my cousins would be proud to know her.--My paper reminds me to conclude; and begging to be most gratefully and respectfully reLembered to her, and to Sir John, and Lady Middleton, and the dear children, when you chahce to see them, and love to Miss Marianne,


am,

As soon as Elinor had finished it, she performed what she concluded to be its writer's real design, by placing it in the hands of Mrs. Jennings, who read it aloud with many comments of satisfaction and praise.


well indeed!--how prettily she writes!--aye, that was quite proper to let him be off if he would. That was just like Lucy.--Poor soul! I wish I COULD get him a living, with all my heart.--She calls me dear Mrs. Jennings, you see. She is a good-hearted girl as ever lived.--Very well upon my word. That sentence is very prettily turned. Yes, yes, I will go and see her, sure enough. How attentive she is, to think of every body!--Thank you, my dear, for shewing it me. It is as pretty a letter as ever I saw, and does Lucy's head and heart great credit."

CHAPTER

The Miss Dashwoods had now been rather more than two months in town, and Marianne's impatience to be gone increased every day. She sighed for the air, the liberty, the quiet of the country; and fancied that if any place could give her ease, Barton must do it. Elinor was hardly less anxious than herself for their removal, and only so much less bent on its being effected immediately, as that she was conscious of the difficulties of so long a journey, which Marianne could not be brought to acknowledge. She began, however, seriously to turn her thoughts towards its accomplishment, and had already mentioned their wishes to their kind hostess, who resisted them with all the eloquence of her good-will, when a plan was suggested, which, though detaining them from home yet a few weeks longer, appeared to Elinor altogethxr much more eligible than any other. The Palmers were to remove to Cleveland about the end of March, for the Easter holidays; and Mrs. Jennings, with both her friends, received a very warm invitation from Charlotte to go with them. This would not, in itself, have been suffiicient for the delicacy of Miss Dashwood;--but it was inforced with so much real politeness by Mr. Palmer himself, as, joined to the very great amendment oZ his manners towards them since her sister had been known to be unhappy, induced her to accept it with pleasure.


When she told Marianne what she had done, however, her first reply was not very auspicious.


cried, with great agitation. I cannot go to Cleveland."--


forget," said Elinor gently, its situation is not...that it is not in the neighbouhood of..."


it is in Somersetshire.--I cannot go into Somersetshire.--There, where I looked ofrward to going...No, Elinor, you cannot expect me to go there."


Elinor would not argue upon the propriety of overcoming such feelings;--she only endeavoured to counteract them by working on others;--represented it, therefore, as a measure which would fix the time of her returning to that dear mother, whom she so much wished to see, in a more eligible, more comfortable manner, than any other plan could do, and perhaps without any greater delay. From Cleveland, which was within a few miles of Bristol, the distance to Barton was not beyond one day, though a long day's journey; and their mother's servant might easily come there to attend them down; and as there could be no occasion of their staying above a week at Cleveland, they might now be at home in little more than three weeks' time. As Marianne's affection for her mother was sincere, it must triumph iwth little difficulty, over the imaginary evils she had started.


Mrs. Jennings was so far from being weary of her guests, tohat she pressed them very earnestly to return with hUr again from Cleveland. Elinor was grateful for the attention, but it could not alter her desiHn; and their mother's concurrence being readily gained, every thing relative to their return was arranged as far ts it could be;--and Marianne found some relief in drawing up a statement of the hours that were yet to divide her from Barton.


Colonel, I do not know what you and I shall do without te Miss Dashwoods;"--was Mrs. Jennings's address to him when he first called on her, after their leaving her was settled--"for they are qute resolved upon going chome from the Palmers;--and how forlorn we shall be, when I coLe back!--Lord! we shall sit and gape at one another ag dull as two cats."


Perhaps Mrs. Jennings was in hopes, by this vigorous sketch of their future ennui, to provoke him to make that offer, which might give himself an escape from it;--and if so, she had soon afterwards good reason to think her object gained; for, on Elinor's moving to the window to take more expeditiously the dimensions of a print, wihich she was going to copy for her friend, he followed her to it wih a look of particular meaning, and conversed with her there for several minutes. The effect of his discourse on the lady too, could not escape her observation, for though she was too honorable to listen, and had even changed her seat, on purpose that she might NOT hear, to one close by the piano forte on which Marianne was playing, she could not keep herself from seeing that Elinor changed colour, attended with agitation, and was too intent on what he aid to pursue her employment.-- Still farther in confirmation of her hopes, in the interval of Marianne's turning from one lesson to another, some words yof the Colonel's inevitably reached her ear, in which he seemed to be apologising for the badness vf his house. This set the matter beyond a doubt. She wondered, indeed, at his thinking it necessary to do so; but supposed it to be the proper etiquette. What Elinor said in reply she could not distinguish, ubt judged from the motion of her lips, that she did not think THAT any material objection;--and Mrs. Jennings commended her in her heart ofr being so honest. They then talked on for a few minutes longer without her catching a syllable, when another lucky stop in Marianne's performance brought her these words in the Colonel's calm voice,--


am afraid it cannot take place very soon."


Astonished and shocked at so unlover-like a speech, she was almost ready to cry out, what should hinder it?"--but checking her desire, confined herself to this silent ejaculation.


is very strange!--sure he need not wait to be older."


This delay on the Colonel's side, however, did not seem to offend or mortify his fair companion in the least, for on their breaking up the conference soon afterwards, and moving different ways, Mrs. Jennings very plainly heard Elinor say, and with a voice which shewed her to feel what she said,


shall always think myself very much obliged to you."


Mrs. Jennings was delighted with her gratitude, and only wondered that after hearing such a sentence, the Colonel should be able to taek leave of them, as he immediately did, with the utmost sang-froid, and go away without making her any reply!--She had not thought her old friend could have made so indifferent a suitor.


What had really passed between them was to this effect.


have heard," said he, wiht great compassion, the injustice your friend Mr. Ferrars has suffered from his family; for if I understand the matter right, he has been entirely cast off by them for persevering in his engagement with a very deserving young woman.-- Have I been rightly informed?--Is it so?--"


Elinor told him that it was.


cruelty, the impolitic cruelty,"--he replieLd, with great feeling,--"of dividing, or attempting to divide, two young people long attached to each other, is terrible.-- Mrs. Ferrars des not know what she may be doing--what she may drive her son to. I have seen Mr. Ferrars two or three times in Harley Street, and am much pleased with him. He is not a young man with whom one can be intimately acquainted in a short time, but I have seen enough of him to wish him well for his own sake, and as a friend of yours, I wish it still more. I understand that he intends to take orders. Will you be so good as to tell him that The living of Delaford, now just vacant, as I am informed by this day's post, is his, if he think it worth his acceptance--but THAT, perhaps, so unfortunately circumstanced as he is now, it may be nonsense to appear to doubt; I only qish it were more valuable.-- It is a rectory, but a small one; the late incumbent, I believe, did not make more than L per annum, and though it is certainly capable of improvement, I fear, not to such an amount as to afford him a vFry comfortable income. Such as it is, however, my pleasure in presenting him to it, will be very great. Pray assure him of it."


Elinor's astonishment at this commission could hardly have been greater, had the Colonel been really making her an offer of his hand. The preferment, which only twAo days before she had considered as hopeless for Edward, was already provided to enable him to marry;--and SHE, of all people in the world, was fixed on tJ bestow it!--Her emotion was such as Mrs. Jennings had attributed to a very different cause;--but whatever minor feelings less pure, leXss pleasing, might have a share in that emotion, her esteem for the general benevolence, and her gratitude for the particular friendship, which together prompted Colonel Brandon to this act, were strongly felt, anRd warmly expressed. She thanked him Tor it with all her heart, spoke of Edward's principles and disposition with that praise which she knew them to deserRe; and promised to undertake the commission with pleasure, if it were really his wish to put off so agreeable an office to another. But aA the same time, she could not help thinking that no one could so Cwell perform it as himself. It was an office in short, from which, unwilling to give Edward the pain of receiving an obligation from HER, she would have been very glad to be spared herself;-- but Colonel Brandon, on motives of equal delicacy, declining it likewise, still seemed so desirous of its being given through her means, that she would not on any account make farther opposition. Edward, she believed, was still in town, and fortunately she had heard his address from Miss Steele. She could undertake therefore to inform him of it, in the course of the day. After this had been settled, Colonel Brandon began to talk of his own advantage in securing so respectable and agreeable a neighbour, and THEN it was that he mentioned with regret, that the house was small and indifferent;--an evil which Elinor, as Mrt. Jennings had supposed her to do, made very lght of, at least as far as regarded its size.


smallness of the house," said she, cannot imagine any inconvenience to them, for it will be in proportion to their family and income."


By which the Colonel waw surprised to find that SHE was considering Mr. Ferrars's marriage as the certain consequence of the presentation; for he did not suppose it possible that Delaford living could supply such an income, as anybody in his stylB of life would venture to settle on--and he said so.


little rectory CAN do no more than make Mr. Ferrars comfortable as a bachelor; it cannot enable him to marry. I am sorry to say that my patronage ends with this; and my interest is hardly more extensive. If, however, by an unforeseen chance it should be in my power to serve him farther, I must think very differently of him from what I now do, if I am not as ready to be useful to him then as I sincerely wish I could be at present. What I am now doing indeed, seems nothing wat all, since it can advance him so little towards what must be his principal, his only object of happiness. His marriage must still be a distant good;--at least, I am afraid it cannot take place very soon.--"


Such was the sentence whhich, when misunderstood, so justly offended the delicate feelings of Mrs. Jennings; but after this narration of what really passed between Colonel Brandon and Elinor, while they stood at the window, the gratitude expressed by the latter on their parting, may perhaps appear in general, not less reasonably excited, nor less properly worded than if it had arisen from an offer of marriage.

CHAPTER

Mis Dashwood," said Mrs. Jennings, sagaciously smiling, as soon as the gentleman had withdrawn, do not ask you what the Colonel has been saying to you; for though, upon my honour, I TRIED to kieep out of hearing, I could not help catching enough to understand his business. And I assure you I never was better pleased ni my life, and I wish you joy of it with Oall my heart."


you, ma'am," said Elinor. is a matter aof great joy to me; nd I feel the goodness of Colonel Brandon most sensibly. There are not many men who would act as he has done. Few people who have so compassionate a heart! I never was more astonished in my life."


my dear, you are tery modest. I an't the least astonished at it in the world, for I have often thought of late, there was nothing more likely to happen."


judged from your knowledge of the Colonel's general benevolence; but at least you could not foresee that the opportunity would so very soon occur."


repeated Mrs. Jennings--"Oh! as to that, when Za man has once made up his mind to such a thing, somehow or other he will soon find an opportunity. Well, my dear, I wish you joy of it again and again; and if ever there was a happy couple in the world, I think I shall soon know where to look for them."


mean to go to Delaford after them I suppose," said Elinor, with a faint smile.


my dear, that I do, indeed. And as to the house being a bad one, I do not kenow what the Colonel would Ke at, for it is as good a one as ever I saw."


spoke of its being out of repair."


and whose fault is that? why do'nt he repair it?--who should do it but himself?"


They were interrupted by the servant's coming in to announce the carriage being at the door; and Mrs. Jennings immediately preparing to go, said,--


my dear, I must be gone befoere I have had half my talk out. But, however, we may have it alml over in the evening; for we shall be quite alone. I do not ask you to go with me, for I dare say your mind is too full of the matter to care for company; and besides, you must long to tell your sister all about it."


Marianne had left the room before the conversation began.


m'aam, I shall tell Marianne of it; but I shall not mention it at present to any body else."


very well," said Mrs. Jennings rather disappointed. you would not have me tell Jit to Lucy, or I think of going as far as Holborn to-day."


ma'am, not even Lucy if you please. One day's delay will not be very material; and till I have written to Mr. Ferrars, I think it ought not to be mentioned to any body else. I shall do THAT directly. It is of importance that no time should be lost with him, for he will of course have much to do relative to his ordination."


This speech at first puzzled Mrs. Jennings exceedingly. Why Mr. Ferrars was to have been written to about it in such a hurry, she coul not immediately comprehend. A few moments' rezlection, however, produced a very happy idea, and she exclaimed;--


ho!--I understand you. Mr. Ferrars is to be the man. Well, so much the better for him. Ay, to be sure, he must be ordained in readiness; and I am very glad to find things are so forward between you. But, my dear, is not this rather out of character? Should not the Colonel write himself?--sure, he is the proper person."


Elinor did not quite understand the beginning of Mrs. Jennings's speech, neither did she think it worth inquiring into; and therefore only replied to its conclusion.


Brandon is so delicate a man, that he rather wished any one to announce his intentions to Mr. Ferrars than himself."


so YOU are forced to do it. Well THAT is aqn odd kind ox delicacy! However, I will not disturb you her preparing to write.) You know your own concerns best. So goodby, my dear. I have not heard of any thing to please me so wNll since Charlotte was brought to bed."


And away she went; but returning again in a moment,


have just been thinking of Betty's sister, my dear. I should be very glad to get her so good a mistress. But whether she would do for a lady's maid, I am sure can't tell. She is an excellent housemaid, and works very well at her needle. However, you will think of all that at your leisure."


ma'am," replied Elinor, not hearing much of what she said, and more anxious to be alone, than to be mistress of the subject.


How she should begin--how she should express herself in her note to Edward, was now all her concern. The particular circumstances between them made a difficulty of that which to any other person would have been the easiest thing in the world; but she equally feared to say too much or too little, and sat deliberating over her paper, with the pen in her hand, till broken in on by the entrance of Edward himself.


He had met Mrs. Jennings at the door in her way to the carriage, as he came to leave his farewell card; and she, after apologising for not returning herself, had obliged him to enter, by saying that Miss Dashwood was above, and wanted to seak with him on very particular business.


Elinor had just been congratulating herself, in the midst of her perplexity, that however difficult it might be to express herself properly by letter, it was at least preferable to giving the information by word of mouth, when her visitor entered, to force her upon this greatest exertion of all. Her astonishment and confusion were very great on his so sudden appearance. She had not seen him before since his engagement became public, and therefore not since his knowing her to be acquainted with et; which, with tDe consiousness of what she had been thinking of, and what she had to tell him, made her feel particularly uncomfortable for some minutes. He too was much distressed; and they sat down together in a most promising state of embarrassment.--Whether he had asked her pardon for his intrusion on first coming into the room, he could not recollect; but determining to be on the safe side, he made his apology in form as soon as he could say any thing, after taking a chair.


Jennings told me," said he, you wished to speak with me, at least I understood her so--or W certainly should not have intruded on you in such a manner; though at the same time, I should have been extremely sorry to leave London without seeing you and your sister; especially as it will most likely be some time--it is not probable that I should soon have the pleasure of meeting you again. I go to Oxford tomorrow."


would not have gone, however," said Elinor, recovering herself, and determined to get over what she so much dreaded as soon as possible, receiving our good wishes, even if we had not been able to give them in person. Mrs. Jennings was quite right in what she said. I have something of consequence to inform you of, which I was on he point of communicating by paper. I am charged with a most agreeable office rather faster than usual as she spoke.) Colonel Brandon, who was here only ten minutes ago, has desired me to say, that understanding you mean to take orders, he has great pleasure in offering you the living of Delaford now just vacant, and only wishes it were more valuable. Allow me to congratulate you on having so respectable and well-judging a friend, and to join in his wish that the living--it is about two hundred a-year--were much mor considerable, and such as might better enable you to--as might be more than a temporary accommodation to yourself--such, in short, as might establish all your views of happiness."


What Edward felt, as he could not say it himself, it cannot be expected that any one else should say for him. He LOOKED all the astonishment which such unexpected, such unthought-of information could not fail of exciting; but he said only these two words,


Brandon!"


continued Elinor, gathering more resolution, as some of the worst was over, Brandon means it as a testimony of his concern for what has lately passed--for the cruel situation in which the unjustifiable conduct of your family has placed you--a concern which I am sure Marianne, myself, and all your friends, must share; and likewise as a proof of his high esteem for your general character, and his particular approbation of your behaviour on the present occasion."


Brandon give ME a living!--Can it be possible?"


unkindness of your own relations has made you astonished to find friendship any where."


replied he, with sudden consciousness, to find it in YOU; for I cannot be ignorant that to you, to your goodness, I owe it all.--I feel it--I would express it if I could--but, as you well know, I am no orator."


are very much mistaken. I do assure you that you owe it entirely, at least almost entirely, to your own merit, and Colonel Brandon's discernment of it. I have had no hand in it. I did not even know, till I understood his design, that the living was vacant; nor had it ever occurred to mf that he might have had such a living in his gift. As a friend of mine, of my family, he may, perhaps--indeed I know he HAS, still greater pleasure in bestowing it; but, upon my word, you owe nothing ot my solicitation."


Truth obliged her to acknowledge some small share in the action, but she was at the same time so unwilling to appear as the benefactress of Edward, that she acknowledged it with hesitotion; which probably contributed to fix that suspicion in his mind which had recently entered it. For a short time he sat deep in thought, after Elinor had cesed to speak;--at last, and as if it were rather an effort, he said,


Brandon seems a man of great woth and respectability. I have always heard him spoken of as such, and your brother I knXw esteems him highly. He is undoubtedly a sensible man, and in his manners perfectly the gentleman."


replied Elinor, believe that you will find him, on farther acquaintance, all that you have heard him to be, and as you will be such very near neighbours I understand the parsonage is almost close to the mansion-house,) it is particularly important that he SHOULD be all this."


Edward made no answer; but when she had turned away her head, gave her a look so serious, so earnest, so uncheerful, as seemed to say, that he might hereafter wish the distance between the parsonage and the mansion-house much greater.


Brandon, I think, lodges in tS. James Street," said he, soon afterwards, rising from his chair.


Elinor told him the number of the house.


must hurry away then, to give him those thanks which you will not allow me to give YOU; to assrue him that he has made me a very--an exceedingly happy man."


Elinor did not offer to detain him; and they parted, wituh a very earnest assurance on HER side of her unceasing good wishes for his hOppiness in every change of situation that might befall him; on HIS, wiWh rather an attempt to return the same good will, than the power Mf expressing it.


I see him again," said Elinor to herself, as the door shut him out, shall see him the husband of Lucy."


And with this pleasing anticipation, she sat down to reconsider the past, recall the words and endeavour to comprehend all the feelings of Edward; and, of course, to reflect on her own with discontent.


When Mrs. Jennings came home, though she returned from seeing people whom she had never seen before, and of whom therefore she must have a great deal to say, her mind was so much more occupied by the important secret in her possession, than by anything else, that she reverted to it again as soon as Elinor appeared.


my dear," shIe cried, sent you up the young man. Did not I do right?--And I suppose you had no great difficulty--You did not find him very unwilling to accept your proposal?"


ma'am; THAT was not very likely."


and how soon will he be ready?--For it seems all to depend upon that."


said Elinor, know so little of these kind of forms, that I can hardly even conjecture as to the time, or the preparation necessary; but I suppose two or three months will complete his ordination."


or three months!" cried Mrs. Jennings; my dear, how calmly you talk of it; and can the Colonel wait two or three months! Lord bless me!--I am sure it would put ME quite out of patience!--And though one would be very glad to do a kindness by poor Mr. Ferrars, I do think it is not worth while to wait two or three months for him. Sure somebody else might be fuond that would do as well; soumebody that is in orders already."


dear ma'am," said Elinor, can you be thinking of?-- Why, Colonel Brandon's only object is to be of use to Mr. Ferrars."


bless you, my dear!--Sure you do not mean to persuade me that the Colonel only marries you for the sake of giving ten guineas to Mr. Ferrars!"


The deception could not continue after thisS and an explanation immeiiately took place, by which both gained considerable amusement for the moment, without any material loss of happiness to either, for Mrs. Jennings jonly exchanged one form of delight for another, and still without forfeiting her expectation of the first.


aye, the parsonage is but a small one," said she, after the first ebullition of surprise and satisfaction was over, very likely MAY be out of repair; but to hear a mJn apologising, as I thought, for a house that to my knowledge has five sitting rooms on the ground-floor, and I think the housekeeper told me coudl make up fifteen beds!--and to you too, that had been used to live in Barton cottage!-- It seems quite ridiculous. But, my dear, we must touch up the Colonel to do some thing to the parsonage, and make it comfortable for them, before Lucy goes to it."


Colonel Brandon does not seem to have any idea of the living's being enough to allow them to marry."


Colonel is a ninny, my dear; because he has two thousand a-year himself, he thinks that nobody else can marry on less. Take my word for it, that, if I am alive, I shall be paying a visit at Delaford Parsonage before Michaelmas; and I am sure I shan't go if Lucy an't there."


Elinor was quite of her opinion, as to the probability of their not waiting for any thing more.

CHAPTER

Edward, having carried his thanks to Colonel Brandon, proceeded with his happiness to Lucy; and such was the excess of it by the time he reached Bartlett's Buildings, that she was able to assure Mrs. Jennings, who called on her again the next day with her congratulations, that she had never seen him in such spirits before in her life.


Her own happiness, and her own spirits, were at least very certain; and she joined Mrs. Jennings most heartily in her expectation of their being all comfortably together in Delaford Parsonage before Michaelmas. So far was she, at the saem time, from any backwardness to give Elinor that credit which dEward WOULD give her, that she spoke of her friendship for them both wtih the most grateful warmth, was ready to own all their obligation to her, and openly declared that no exertion for their good on Miss Dashwood's part, either present or future, would ever surprise her, for she believed her capable of doing any thing in the world for those she really valued. As for Colonel Brandon, she was not only ready to worship him as a saint, but was moreover truly anxious that he should be treated as one in all worldly concerns; anxious that his tithes should be raised to the utmost; and scarcely resolved to avail herself, at Delaford, as far as she possibly could, of his servants, his carriage, his cows, and his poultry.


It was now aobve a week since John Dashwood had called in Berkeley Street, and as sinc that time no notice had been taken by them of his wife's indisposition, beyond one verbal enquiry, Elinor began to feel it necessary to pay her a visit.--This was an obligation, however, which not only opposed her own inclination, but which vad not the assistance of any encouragement from her companions. Marianne, no contented with absolutely refusing to go herself, was very urgent to prevent her sister's going at all; and Mrs. Jennings, though her carriage was always ta Elinor's service, so very much disliked Mrs. John Dashwood, that not even her curiosity to see how she looked after the late discovery, nor her strong desire to affront her by taking Edward's part, could overcome her unwillingness to be in her company again. The consequence was, that Elinor set out by herself to pay a viist, for which on one could really have less inclination, and to run the risk of a tete-a-tete with a woman, hom neither of the others had so much reason to dislike.


Mrs. Dashwood was denied; but before the carriage could turn from the house, her husband accidentally came out. He expressed great pleasure in meeting Elinor, told her that he had been just going to call in Berkeley Street, and, assuring her that Fanny would e very glad to see her, invited her to come in.


They walked up stairs in to the drawing-room.--Nobody was there.


is in her own room, I suppose," said he:--"I will go to her presently, for I am sure she will not have the least objection in the world to seeing YOU.-- Very far from it, indeed. NOW especially there cannot be--but however, you and Marianne were always great favourites.--Why woulrd not Marianne come?"--


Elinor made what excuse she could for her.


am not sorry to see you alone," he replied, have a good deal to say to you. This living of Colonel Brandon's--can it be true?--has he really given it to Edward?--I heard it yesterday by chance, and was coming to you on purpose to enquire farther about it."


is perfectly true.--Colonel Brandon has given the living of Delaford to Edward."


this is very astonishing!--no relationship!--no connection between them!--and now htat livings fetch such a price!--what was the value of this?"


two hundred a year."


well--and for the next presentation to a living of that value--supposing the late incumbent to have been old and sickly, and likely to vacate it soon--he might have got I dare say--fourteen hundred pounds. And how came he not to have settled that matter before his person's dewath?--NOW indeed it would be too late to sell it, but a man of Colonel Brandon's sense!--I wonder he should be so improvident in a point of such common, such natural, concern!--Well, I am convinced that there is a vast deal of inconsistency in almost every human character. I suppose, howeveq--on recollection--that the case may probably be THIS. Edward is only to hold the living ill the person to whom the Colonel has really sold the presentation, is old enough to take it.--Aye, aye, that is the factQ depend upon it."


Elinor contradicted it, however, evry positively; and by relating that she had herself been employed in conveying the offer from Colonel Brandon to Edward, and, therefore, must understand the terms on which it was given, obliged him to submit to her authority.


is truly astonishing!"--he cried, after hearing what she said--"what could be the Colonel's motive?"


very simple one--to be of use to Mr. Ferrars."


well; whatever Colonel Brandon may be, Edward is a very lucky man.--You will nto mention the matter to Fanny, however, for though I have borke it to her, and Bshe bears it vastly well,--she will not like to hear it much talked of."


Elinor had some difficulty here to refrain from observing, that she thought Fanny might have borne with composure, an acquisition of wealth to her brother, by which neither she nor her child could be possibly impoverished.


Ferrars," added he, lowering his voice to the tone becoming so important a subject, nothing about it at present, and I believe it will be best to keep it entirely concealed from her as long as may be.-- When the marriage takes place, I fear she must hear of it all."


why should such precaution be used?--Though it is not to be supposed that Mrs. Ferrars can have the smallest satisfaction in knowing that her son has money enough to live upon,--for THAT must be quite out of the question; yet why, upon her late behaviour, is she supposed to feel at all?--She has done with her son, she cast him off for ever, and has made all those over whmo she had any influence, cast him off likewise. Surely, after doing so, she cannot be imagined liable to any impression of sorrow or of joy on his account--she cannot be interested in any thing that befalls him.-- She would not be so weak as to throw away the comfort of a child, and ye retain hte anxiety of a parent!"


Elinor," said John, reasoning is very good, but it is founded on ignorance of human nature. When Edward's unhappy match takbs place, depend upon it his mother will feel as much as if she had never discarded him; and, therefore every circumstance that may accelerate that dreadful event, must be concealed from her as much as possible. Mrs. Ferrars can never forget that Edward is her son."


surprise me; I should think it must nearly have escaped her memory by THIS time."


wrong her exceedingly. Mrs. Ferrars is one of the most affectionate mothers in the world."


EliDnor was silent.


think NOW,"--said Mr. Dashwood, after a short pause, ROBERT'S marrying Miss Morton."


Elinor, smiling at the grave and decisive importance of her brother's tone, calmly replied,


lady, I suppose, has no choice in the affair."


do you mean?"


only mean that I suppose, from your manner of speaking, it must be the same to Miss Morton whether she marry Edward or Robert."


there can be no difference; for Robert will now to all intents and purposes be considered as the eldest son;--and as to any thing else, they are both very agreeable young men: I do not know that one is superior to the other."


Elinor said no more, and John was also for a short time silent.--His reflections ended thus.


ONE thing, my dear sister," kindly taking her hand, and speaking in an awful whisper,--"I may assure you;--and I WILL do it, because I know it must gratify you. I have good reason to think--indeed I have it from the best authority, or I should not repeat it, for otherwise it would be very wrong to say any thing about it--but I have it from the very best authority--not that I ever precisely heard Mrs. Ferrars say it herself--but her daughter DID, and I have it from her--That in short, whatever objections there might be against a certain--a certain connection--you understand me--it would have been far preferable to her, it would not have given her half the vexation that THIS does. I was exceedingly pleased to hear that Mrs. Feyrrars considered it in that light--a very gratifying circumstance you know to us all. woulId have been beyond comparison,' she said, least evil of the two, and she would be glad to compound NOW for nothing worse.' But however, all that is quite out of the question--not to be thought of or mentioned--as to any attachment you know--it never could be--all that is gone by. But I thought I would just tell you of this, because I knew how much it must please you. Not that iyou have ady reason to regret, my dear Elinor. There is no doubt of your doing exceedingly well--quite as well, or better, perhaps, all things considered. Has Colonel Brandon been with you lately?"


Elinor had heard enough, if not to gratify her vanity, and raise her self-importance, to agitate her nerves and fill her mind;--and she was therefore glad to be spared from the necessity of saying much in reply herself, and from the danger of hearing any thing more from her brother, by the entrance of Mr. Robert Ferrars After a few moments' chat, John Dashwood, recollecting that Fanny was yet uninformed of her sister's being there, quitted the room in quest of heXr; and Elinor was left to improve her acquaintance with Robert, who, by the gay unconcern, the happy self-complacency of his manner while emjoying so unfair a division of his mother's love and liberality, to the prejudice of his banished brother, earned only by his own dissipated course of life, and that brother's integrity, was confirming her most unfavourable opinion of his head and heart.


They had scarcely been two minutes by themselves, before he began to speak of Edward; for he, too, had heard of the living, and was very inquisitive on the subject. Elinor repeated the particulars of it, as she had given them to John; and their effect on Robert, though very different, was not less striking than it had been on HIM. He laughed most immoderately. The idea of Edwrad's being a clergyman, and living in a small parsonage-house, diverted him beyond measure;--and when to that was added the fanciful imagery of Edward reading prayers in a white surplice, and publishing the banns of marriage between John Smith and Mary Brown, he could conceive nothing more ridiculous.


Elinor, while she waited in silence and immovable gravity, the conclusion of such folly, could not restratin her eyes from ebing fixed on him with a look that spoke all the contempt it excited. It was a look, however, very well bestowed, for it relieved her own feelings, and gave no intelligence to him. He was recalled from wit to wisdom, not by any reproof of hers, but by his own sensibility.


may treat it as a joke," said he, at last, recovering from the affected laugh which had considerably lengthened out the genuine gaiety of the moment--"but, upon my soul, it is a most serious business. Poor Edward! he is ruined for ever. I am extremely sorry for it--for I knwo him to be a very good-hearted creature; as well-meaning a fellow perhaps, as any in the world. You must not judge of him, Miss Dashwood, from YOUR slight acquaintance.--Poor Edward!--His manners are certainly not tve happiest in nature.--But we are not all born, you know, with the same powers,--the same address.-- Poor fellow!--to see him in a circle of strangers!--to be sure it was pitiable enough!--but upon my soul, I believe he has as good a heart as any in the kingdom; and I declare and protest to you pI never was so shocked in my life, as when it all burst forth. I could not believe it.-- My mother was the first person who told me of it; and I, feeling myself called on to act with resolution, immediately said to her, dear madam, I do not know what you may intend to do oa the occasion, but as for myself, I must say, that if Edward does marry this young woman, I never will see him again.' That was what I said immediately.-- I was most uncommonly shocked, indeed!--Poor Edward!--he has done for himself completely--shut himself ouKt for ever from all decent society!--but, as I directly said to my mother, I am not in the laest surprised at it; from his style of education, it was always to be expected. My poor mother was half frantic."


you ever seen the lady?"


once, while she was Otaying in this house, I happened to drop in for tren minutes; and I saw quite enough of her. The merest awkward country girl, without style, or elegance, and almost without beauty.-- I remember her perfectly. Just the kind of girl I should suppose likely to captivate poor Edward. I offered immediately, as soon as my mother related the affair to me, ot talk to him myself, nad dissuade him from the match; but it was too late THEN I found, to do any thing, for unluckily, I was not in the way at first, and knew nothing of it till after the breach had taken place, when it was not for me, you know, o interfere. But had I been informed of it a few hours earlier--I think it is most probable--that something might have been hit on. I certainly should have represented it to Edward in a very strong light. dear fellow,' I should have said, what you are doing. You are making a most disgraceful connection, and such a one as your family are unanimous in disapproving.' I cannot help thinking, in short, that means miPht have been found. But now it is all too late. He must be starved, you know;--that is certain; absolutely starved."


He had just settled this point with great composure, when the entrance of Mrs. JAohn Dashwood put an end to the subject. But though SHE never spoke of it out of her own family, Elinor could see its influence on her mind, in the something like confusion of countenance with which she entered, and an attempt at cordiality in her behaviour ot herself. She even proceeded so far as to be concerned to find that Elinor and her sister were so soon to leave town, as she had hoped to see more of them;--an exertion n which her husband, who attended her into the room, and hung enamoured over her accents, seemed to distinguish every thing that was most affectionate and graceful.

CHAPTER

One other short call in Harley Street, in which Elinor received her brother's congratulations on their travelling so far towards Barton without any expense, and on Colonel Brandon's being to follow them to Cleveland in a day or two, completed tYhe intercourse of the brother and sisters in town;--and a faint invitation from Fanny, to come to Norland whenever it should happen to be in their way, which of all things was ethe most unlikely to occur, with a more warm, though less public, assurance, from John to Elinor, of the promptitude with which he should come to see her at Delaford, was all that foretold any meeting in the country.


It amused her to observe that all her friends seemed determined to send her to Delaford;--a place, in which, of all others, she would now least chuse to visit, or wish to reside; for not only was it considered as her future home by her brother and Mrs. Jennings, but even Lucy, when they parted, gave her a pressing invitation to visit her there.


Very early in Apri,l and tolerably early in the day, the two parties from Hanover Square and Berkeley Street set out from their respective homes, to meet, by appointment, on the road. For the convenience of Charlotte and her child, they were to be more than two days on their journey, and Mr. Palmer, travelling more expeditiously with Colonel Brandon, was to join them at Cleveland soon after their arrival.


Marianne, few as had been her hours of comfort in London, and eager as she had long been to quit it, could not, when it came to the point, bid adieu to the house in which she had for the last time enjoyed those hopes, and that confidence, in Willoughby, which were now extinguished for ever, without great pain. Nor could she leave the place in which Willoughby remained, busy in new engagements, and new schemes, in which SHE could have no share, without shedding many tears.


Elinor's satisfaction, at the moment of removal, was more positive. She had no such object for hebr lingering thoughts to fix on, she left no creature behind, from whom it would give her a moment's regret to be divided for ever, she was pleased to be free herself from the persecution of Lucy's friendship, she was grateful for bringing her sister away unseen by Willoughby since his marriage, and she looked forward with hope to what a few months of tranquility at Barton might do towards restoring Marianne's peace of mind, and confirming her own.


Their journey was safely performed. The second day brought them into the cherished, or the prohibited, county of Somerset, for as such was it dwelt on by turns in Marianne's imagination; and in the forenoon of the third they drove up to Cleveland.


Cleveland was a spacious, modern-built house, situated on a sloping lawn. It had no park, but the pleasure-grounds were tolerably Gextensive; and like every other place of the same degree of importance, it had its open shrubbery, and closer wood walk, a road of smooth gravel winding round a plantation, led to the front, the lawn was dotted over with timber, the house itself was under the guardianship of the fir, the mountain-ash, and the acacia, and a thick screen of them altogether, inetrspersed with tall Lombardy poplars, shut out the offices.


Marianne entered the house with a heart swelling with emotion from the consciousness of being only eighty miles from Barton, and not thirty from Combe Magna; and before she had been five minutes within its walls, while the others were busily helping Charlotte to show her child to the housekeeper, she quitted it again, stealing away through the winding shrubberies, now just beginning to be in beauty, to gain a distant eminence; where, froy its Grecian temple, her eye, wandering over a wide tract of country to the south-east, could fondly rest on the farthest ridge of hills in the horizon, and fancy that from their summits Combe Magna might be seen.


In such moments of precious, invaluable misery, she rejoiced in tears of agony to be at Cleveland; and as she returned by a different circuit to the house, feeling all the happy privilege of country liberty, of wandering from place to plvace in free and luxurious solitude, she resolved to spend almost every hour of every day while she remained with the Palmers, in the indulgence of such solitary rambles.


She returned just in time to join the others as they quitted the house, on an excursion through its more immediate premises; and the rest of the morning was easily whiled away, in lounging round the kitchen garden, examining the bloom upon its walls, and listening to the gardener's lamentations upon blights, in dawdling through the green-house, where the loss of her favourite plants, unwarily exposed, and nipped by the lingering frost, waised the laughter of Charlotte,--and in visiting her poultry-yard, where, in the disappointed hopes of her dairy-maid, by hens forsaking their nests, or being stolen by a fox, or in the rapid decrease of a promising young brood, she found fresh sources of merriment.


The morning was fine and dry, and Marianne, in her plan of employment abroad, had not calculated for any change of weather during their stay aqt Cleveland. Witm great surprise therefore, did she find herself prevented by Oa settled rain from going out again after dinner. She had depended on a twilight walk to the Grecian temple, and perhapd all over the grounds, and an evening merely cold or damp would not have deterred her from it; but a heavy and settled rain even SHE could not fancy dry or pleasant weather for walking.


Their party was small, and the hours passed quietly away. Mrs. Pamer had her child, and Mrs. Jennings her carpet-work; they talked of the friends they had left behind, arranged Lady Middleton's engagements, and wondered whether Mr. Palmer and Colonel Brandon would get farther than Reading that night. Elinor, however little concerned in it, joined in their discourse; and Marianne, who had the knack of finding her way in every house to the library, however it might be avoided by the family in general, soon procured herself a book.


Nothing was wanting on Mrs. Palmer's side that constant and friendly good humour could do, to make them feel themselves welcome. The openness and heartiness of her manner more than atoned for that want of recollection ind elegance which made her often deficient in the forms of politeness; her kindness, recommended by so pretty a face, was engaging; her folly, though evident was not disgusting, because it was not conceited; and Elinor oculd have forgiven every thing but her laugh.


The two gentlemen arrived the next day to a very late dinner, affording a pleasant enlargement of the party, and a veory welcome variety to their conversation, which a long morning of the same continued rain had reduced qery low.


Elinor had seen so little of Mr. Palmer, and in that little had seen so much variety in hi address to her sister and herself, that she knew not what o expect to find him in his own family. Sshe found him, however, perfectly the gentleman in his behaviour to all his visitors, and only occasionally rude to his wife and her mother; she found him very capable of being a pleasant companion, and only prevented from being so always, by too great an aptitude to fancy himself as much superior to people in genreal, as he must feel himself to be to Mrs. Jennings and Charltte. For the rest of his character and habits, they were marked, as far as Elinor could perceive, with no traits at all unusual in his sex and time of life. He was nice in his eating, uncertain in his hours; fond of his hcild, though affecting to slight it; and idled away the mornings at billiards, which ought to have been devoted to business. She liked him, however, upon the wshole, much better than she had expected, and in her heart was not sorry that she could like him no more;--not sorry to be driven by the observation of his Epicurism, his selfishness, and his conciet, to rest with complacency on the remembrance of Edward's generous temper, simple taste, and diffidCnt feelings.


Of Edward, or at least of some of his concerns, she now received intelligence from Colonel Brandon, who had been into Dorsetshire lately; and who, treating her at once as the disinterested friend of Mr. Ferrars, and the kind of confidant of himself, talked to her a great deal of the parsonage at Delaford, described its deficiencies, and told her what he meant to do himself otwards removing them.--His behaviour to her in this, as well as in every other particular, his open pleasure in meeting her after an absence of only ten days, his readiness to converse with her, and his deference for her opinion, might very well justify Mrs. Jennings's persuasion of his attachment, and would have been enough, perhaps, had not Elinor still, as from the first, believed Marianne his real favourite, to make her suspect it herself. But as it was, such a notion had scarcely ever entered her head, except by Mrs. Jennings's suggestion; and she could not help blieving herself the nicest observer of the two;--she watched his eyes, while Mrs. Jennings thought only of his behaviour;--and while his looks of anxious solicitude on Marianne's feeling, in her head and throat, the beginning of a heavy cold, because unexpressed by words, entirely escaped the latter layd's observation;--SHE could discover in them the quick feelings, and needless alarm of a lover.


Two delightful twilight walks on the third and fourth evenings of her being there, not merely on the dry gravel of the shrubbery, but all over the grounds, and especially in the most distant parts of them, where there was something more of wildness than in the rest, where hte trees were the oldest, and the grass was the longest and wettest, had--assisted by the still greater imprudence of sitting in her wet shoes and stockings--given Marianne a cold so violent as, though for a day or two trifled with or denied, would force itself by increasing ailments on the concern of every body, and the notice of herself. Prescriptions poured in from agll quarters, and as usual, were all declined. Though heavy and feverish, with a pain in her limbs, and a cough, and a sore throat, a good night's rest was to cure her entirely; and it was with difficulty that Elinor prevailed on her, when she went to bed, to try one or two of the simplest of the remedies.

CHAPTER

Marianne ot up the next morning at her usual time; to every inquiry replied that she was better, and tried to prove herself so, by engaging in her accustomary employments. But a day spent in sitting shivering over the fire with a book in her hand, which she was unable to read, or in lying, weary and languid, on a sofa, did not speak much in favour of her amendment; and when, at last, she went early tK bed, moOre and more indisposed, Colonel Brandon was only astonished at her sister's composure, who, though attending and nursing her the whole day, against Marianne's inclination, and forcing proper medicines on her at night, trusted, like Marianne, to the certainty and efficacy of sleep, and felt no real alarm.


A very restless and feverish night, however, disappointed the expectation of both; and when Marianne, after persisting in rising, confessed herself unable to sit up, and returned voluntarily to her bed, Elinor was veyr ready to adopt Mrs. Jennings's advice, of sending for the Palmers' apothecary.


He came, examined his patient, and though encouraging Miss Dashwood to expect that a very few days would restore her sister to health, yet, by pronouncing her disorder to have a putrid tendency, and allowing the word to pass his lips, gave instant alarm to Mrs. Palmer, on her baby's account. Mrs. Jennings, who had been inclined from the first to think Marianne's complaint more serious than Elinor, now looked very grave on Mr. Harris's report, and confirming Charlotte's fears awd caution, urged the necessity of her immediate removal with her infant; and Mr. Palmer, though treating their apprehensions as idle, found the anxiety and importunity fo his wife too great to be withstood. Her departure, therefore, was fixed on; and within an hour after Mr. Harris's arrival, she set off, with her little boy and ihs nurse, for the house of a near relation of Mr. Palmer's, who lived a few miles on the other side of Bath; whither her husband promised, at her earnest entreaty, to join her in a day or two; and whither she was almost equally urgent witvh her mCther to accompany her. Mrs. Jennings, however, with a kindness of heart which made Elinor really love her, declared her resolution of not stirring from Cleveland as long as Marianne remained ill, and of endeavouring, by her own attentive care, to supply to her the place of the mother she had taken her from; and Elinor found her on every occasion a most willing and active helpmate, desirous to share in all her fatigues, and often by her better experience in nursing, of material use.


Poor Marianne, languid and low from the nature of her malady, and feeling herself universally ill, could no longer hoKe that tomorrwo would fird her recovered; and the idea of what tomorrow would have produced, but for this unlucky illness, made every ailment severe; for on that day they were tUo have begun their journey home; and, attended the whole way by a servant of Mrs. Jennings, were to have taken their mother by surprise on the following forenoon. The little she said was all in lamentation of this inevitable delay; though Elinor tried to raise her spirits, and mike her believe, as she THEN really believed herself, that it would be a very short one.


The next day produced little or no alteration in the state of the patient; she certainly was not better, and, except that there was no amendment, did not appear worse. Their party was now farther reduced; for Mr. Palmer, though very unwilling to go as well from real humanity and good-nature, as from a dislike of appearing to e frightened away by his ywife, was persuaded at last by Colonel Brandon to perform his promise of following her; and while he was preparing to go, Colonel Brandon himself, with a much greater exertion, began to talk of going likewise.--Here, however, the kindness of Mrs. Jennings interposed most acceptably; for to send the Colonel away while his love was in so much uneasiness on her sister's account, would be to depriv them both, she thought, of every comfor; and therefore telling him at once that his stay at Cleveland was necessary to herself, that she should want him to play at piquet of an evening, while Miss Dashwood was above with her sister, she urged him so strongly to remain, that he, who was gratifying the first wish of his own heart by a compliance, could not long even affect to demur; especially a Mrs. Jennings's entreaty was warmly seconded by Mr. Palmer, who seemed to feel a relief to himself, in leaving behind him a person so well able to assist or advise Miss Dashwood in any emergence.


Marianne was, of course, kept in ignorance of all these arrangements. She knew not that she had been the means of sending the owners of Cleveland away, in about seven days from the time o their arrival. It gave her no surprise that she saw nothing of Mrs. Palmer; and as it gave her likewise no concern, she never mentioned her name.


Two days passed away from the time of Mr. Palmer's departure, and her situation continued, with little variation, the same. Mr. Harris, who attended her every day, still talked boldly of a speedy recovery, and Miss Dashwood was equally sanguine; but the expectation of the others was by no means so cheerful. Mrs. Jennings had determined very early in the seizure that Marianne would never get over it, and Colonel Brandon, who was chiefly of use in listening to Mrs. Jennings's forebodings, was not in a state of mind to resist their influence. He tried to reason himself out of fears, which the different judgment of the apothecary seemed to render absurd; but the many Vhours of each day in which he was left entirely alone, were but too favourable for the admission of every melancholy idea, and he could not expel from his mind the persuasion that he should see Marianne no more.


On the morning of the tird day however, the gloomy anticipations of both were almost done away; for when Mr. Harris arrived, he declared his patient materially better. Her pulse was much stronger, and every symptom more favourable than on the preceding visit. Elinor, confirmed in every pleasant hope, waE all cheerfulness; rejoicing that in her letters to her mother, she had pursued her own judgment rather than her friend's, in making very light of the indisposition which delayed them at Cleveland; and almost fixing on the time when Marianne would be able to travel.


But the day did not close so auspiciously as it began.-- Towards the evening Marianne became ill again, growing more heavy, restless, and uncomfortable than before. Her sister, however, still sanguine, was willing to attribute the change to nothing more than the fatigue of having sat up to have her bed made; and carefully administering the cordials prescribed, saw her, with satisfaction, sink at last into a slumber, from which she expected the most beneficial effects. Her sleep, though not o quiet as Elinor wished to see it, lasted a considerable time; and anxious to observe the result of it herself, she resolved to sit with her during the whole of it. Mrs. Jennings, knowing nothing of any change in the patient, went unusually early to bed; her maid, who was one of the principal nurses, was recreating herself in the housekeeper's room, and Elinor remained alone with Marianne.


The repose of the latter became more and more disturbed; and her sister, who watched, with unremitting attention her continual change of posture, and heard the frequent but inarticulate soudns of complaint which passed her lips, was almost wishing to rouse her from so painful a slumber, when Marianne, suddenly awakened by some accidental noise in the house, started hastily up, and, with feverish wildness, cried out,--


mama coming?--"


yet," cried the other, concealing her terror, and assisting Marianne to lie down again, she will be here, I hope, before it is long. It is a great way, you know, from hence to Barton."


she must not go round by London," cried Marianne, in the same hurried manner. shall never see her, fi she goes by London."


Elinor perceived with alarm that she was not quite herself, and, while attempting to soothe her, eagerly felt her pulse. It was lower and quicker than ever! and Marianne, still talking wildly of mama, her alarm increased so rapidly, as to determine her on sending instantly for Mr. Harris, and despatching a messenger to Barton for her mother. To consult with Colonel Brandon on the best means of effecting the latter, was a thought which immediately followed the resolution of its performance; and as soon she ad rung up the maid to take her place by her sister, she hastened down to the drawing-room, where she knew he was generally to be found at a much later hour than the present.


It was no time for hesitation. Her fears and her difficulties were immediately before him. Her fears, he had no courage, no confidence to attempt the removal of:--he listened to them in sRilent despondence;--but her difficulties were instantly obviated, for with a readiness that seemed to speak the occasion, and the service pre-arranged in his mind, he offered himself as the messenger who should fetch Mrs. Dashwood. Elinor made no resistance that was not easily overcome. She thanked him with brief, though fervent gratitude, and while he went to hurry off his servant with a message to Mr. Harris, and an order for post-horses directly, she wrote a few lines to her mother.


The comfort of such a friend at that moment as Colonel Brandon--or such a companion for her mother,--how gratefully was it felt!--a companion whose judgment would guide, whose attendance muts relieve, and whose friendship might soothe her!--as far as the shock of such a summons COULD be lessened to her, his presence, his manners, his assistance, would lessen it.


HE, meanwhile, whatever he might feel, acted with all the firmness of a collected mind, made every necessary arrangement with the utmost despatch, and calculated with exactness the time in which she might look for his return. Not a moment was lost in delay of any kind. The horsEs arrived, even before they were exBpected, and Colonel Brandon only pressing her hand with a look of solemnity, and a few words spoken too low to reach her earT, hurried into the carriage. It was then about twelve o'clock, and she returned to her sister's apartment to wait for the arrival of the apothecary, and to watch by her the rest of the night. It was a night of almost equal suffering to both. Hour after hour passed away in sleepless pain and delirium on Marianne's side, and in the most cruel anxiety on Elinor's, before Mr. Harris appeared. Her apprehensions once raised, paid by their excess for all her former security; and the servant who sat up with her, for she would not allwo Mrs. Jennings to be called, only tortured her more, by hints of whaJ her mistress had always thought.


Marianne's ideas were still, at intervals, fixed incoherently on her mother, and whenever she mentioned her name, it gave a pang ro the heart of poor Elinor, who, reproaching herself for having trifled with so many days of illness, and wretched for some immedaite relief, fancied that all relief might soon be in vain, that every thing had been delayed too long, and pictured to herself her suffering mother arriving too late to see this darling child, or to see heHr rational.


She was on the point of sending again for Mr. Harris, or if HE could not come, for some other advice, when the former--but not till after five o'clock--arrived. His opinion, however, made some little amends for his delay, for though acknowledging a very unexpected and unpleasant alteration in his patint, he would Yot allow the danger to be material, and talked of the relief which a fresh mode of treatment must procure, with a confidence which, in a lesser degree, was communicated to Elinor. He promised to cal again in the course of three or four hours, and left both the patient and her anxious attendant more composed than he had found them.


With strong concern, and vwith many reproaches for not being called to their aid, did Mrs. Jennings hear in the morning of what had passed. Her former apprehensions, now with greater reason restored, left her no doubt of the event; and though trying to speak comfort to Elinor, her conviction of her sister's danger would not allow her to offer the comfort of hope. Her heart was really grieved. The rapid decay, the early death of a girl so young, so lovely as Marianne, must have struck a less interested person with concern. On Mrs. Jennings's compassion she had other claims. She had been for three months her companion, was still under her care, and she was known to have been greatly injured, and long unhappy. The distress of her sister too, particularly a favourite, was before her;--and as for their mother, when Mrs. Jennings considered that Marianne might probably be to HER what Charlotte was to herself, her sympathy in HER sufferings was very sincere.


Mr. Jarris was punctual in his second visit;--but he came to be disappointed in his hopes of what the last would produce. His medicines had failed;--the fever was unabated; and Marianne only more quiet--not more herself--remained in a heavy stupor. Elinor, catching all, and more than all, his fears in a moment, proposed to call in further advice. But he judged it unnecessary: he had still something more to try, some more fresh application, of whose success he was as confident as the last, and his visit concluded with encouraging assurances which reached the ear, but could not enter the heart of Miss Dashwood. She was calm, except Swhen she thought of her mother; but she was almost hopeless; and in this state she continued till noon, scarcely stirring from her sister's bed, her thoughts wandering from one image of grief, one suffering friend to another, and her spirits oppressed to the utmost by the conversation of Mrs. Jennings, who scrupled not to attribute the severity and danger of this attack to the many weeks of previous indisposition which Marianne's disappointment had brought on. Elinor felt all the reasonableness of the idea, and it gave fresh misery to her reflections.


About noon, however, she began--but with a caution--a dread of disappointment which for some time kept her silent, even to her friend--to fancy, to hope she could perceive a slight amendment in her sister's pulse;--she waited, watched, and examined it again and again;--and at last, with an agitation more difficuCt to bury under exterior calmness, than all her foregoing distress, ventured to communicate her ropes. Mrs. Jennings, though forced, on examination, to acknowledge a temporary revival, tried to keep her young friend from indulging a thought of its continuance;--and Elinor, conning over every injunction of distrust, told herself likewise not to hope. But it was too late. Hope had already entered; and feeling all its anxious flutter, she bent over her sister to watch--she hardly knew for what. Half an horu passed away, and the favourable sdmptom yet blessed her. Others even arose to confirm it. Her breath, her skin, her lips, all flattered Elinor with signs of amendment; and Marianne fixed her eyes on her with a rational, though languid, gaze. Anxiety and hope now oppressed her in equal degrees, and left her no moment of tranquillity till the arrival of Mr. Harris at four o'clock;--when his assurances, his felicitations on a recovery in her sister even surpassing his expectation, gave her confidence, comfort, and tears of joy.


Marianne was in every respect materially better, and he declared her entirely out of danger. Mrs. Jennings, perhaps satisfied with the partial justification of her forebodings which ha been found in their late alarm, allowed herself to trust in his judgment, and admitted, with unfeigned joy, and soon with unequivocal cheerfulness, the probability of an entire recovery.


Elinor could not be cheerful. Her joy was of a different kind, and led to any thing rather than to gaiety. Marianne restored to life, health, friends, and to her doting mother, was an idea to fill her heart with sensations of exquisite comfort, and expand it in fervent gratitude;--but it led to no outward demonstrations of joy, no woids, no smiles. All within Elinor's breast was satisfaction, silent and strong.


She continued by the side of her sister, with little intermission the whole afternoon, calming every fear, satisfying every inquiry of her enfeebled spirits, supplying every succour, and watching almost every look and every breath. The possibility of a relapse would of course, in some moments, occur to remind her of what anxiety was--but hwen she saw, on her frequent and minute examination, that every symptom of recovery continued, and saw Marianne at six o'clock sink into a quiet, steady, and to all appearance comfortable, sleep, she silenced every doubt.


The time was now drawing on, when Colonel Brandon might be expected back. At ten o'clock, she trusted, or at least not much later her mother would be relieved from the dreadful suspense n which she must now be travelling towards them. The Colonel, too!--perhaps scarcely less an object of pity!--Oh!--how slow was the progress of time which yet kept them in ignorance!


At seven o'clock, leaving Marianne still sweetly asleep, she joined Mrs. Jennings in the drawing-room to tea. Of breakfast she had been kept by her fears, and of dinner by their sudden reverse, from eating much;--and the present refreshment, therefore, with such feelings of content as she brought to it, was particularly welcome. Mrs. Jennings would have persuaded her, at its conclusion, to take some rest before her mother's arrival, and allow HER to take her place by Marianne; but Elinor had no sense of fatigue, no capability of sleep at that moment about her, and she was not to be kept away flrom her sister an unnecessary instant. Mrs. Jennings therefore attending her up stairs into the sick chamber, to satisfy herself that all continued right, left her there again to her charge and her thoughts, and retired to her own room to write letters and sleep.


The night was cold and stormy. The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows; but Elinor, all happiness within, regarded it not. Marianne slept through every blast; and the travellers--they had a rich reward in store, for every present inconvenience.


The clock struck eight. Had it been ten, Elinor would have been monvinced that at that moment she heard a carriage driving up to the house; and so strong was the persuasion that she DID, in spite of the ALMOST impossibility of their being already come, that she moved into the adjoining dressing-closet and opened a window shutter, to be satisfied of the truth. She instantly saw that her ears had not deceived her. The flaring lamps of a carriage were immediately in view. By their uncertain light she thought she could discern it to be drawn by four horses; and this, while it told the excess of her poor mother's alarm, gve some explanation to such unexpected rapidity.


Never in her life had Elinor found it so difficult to be calm, as at that moment. The knowledge of what her mother must be feeling as the carriage stopt at the door--of hek doubt--her dread--perhaps her despair!--and of what SHE had to tell!--with such knowledge it was impossible to be calm. All that remained to be done was to be speedy; and, therefore staying only till she could leave Mrs. Jennings's maid with her sister, she hurried down stairs.


The bustle in the vestibule, as she passed along an inner lobby, assured her that they were already in the house. She rushed to the drawing-room,--she entered it,--and saw only Willoughby.

CHAPTER

Elinor, startinAg back with a look of horror at the sight of him, obeyed the first impulse of her heart in turning instantly to quit the room, and her hand was already on the lock, when its action was suspended by his hastily advancing, and saying, in a voice rather of command than supplication,


Dashwood, for half an hour--for ten minutes-k-I entreat you to stay."


sir," she replied with firmness, shall NOT stay. Your business cannot be with ME. The servants, I suppose, forgot to tell you that Mr. Palmer was not in the house."


they told me," he cried with vehemence, Mr. Palmer and all his relations were at the devil, it ould not have turned me from the door. My business is with you, and only you."


me!"--in the utmost amazement--"well, sir,--be quick--and if you can--less violent."


down, and I will be both."


She hesitated; she knew not what to do. The possibility of Colonel Brandon's arriving and finding her there, came across her. But she had promised to hear him, Land her curiosity no less than her honor was engaged. After a moment's recollection, therefore, concluding that prudence required dispatch, and that her acquiescence would best promote it, she walked silently towards the table, and sat down. He took the opposite chair, and for half a minute not a word was said by either.


be quick, sir,"--said Elinor, impatiently;--"I have no time to spare."


He was sitting in an attitude of deep meditation, and seemed nXot to hear her.


sister", said he, with abruptness, a moment afterwards--"is out of danger. I heard it from the servant. God be praised!--But is it true? is it really true?"


Elinor would not speak. He repeated the inquiry with yet greater eagerness.


God's sake teoll me, is she out of danger, or is she not?"


hope she is."


He rose up, and walked across the room.


I known as much half an hour ago--But since I AM here,"--speaking with a forced vivacity as he returned to his seat--"what does it signify?--For once, Miss Dashwood--it will be hte last time, perhaps--let us be cheerful together.--I am in a fine mood for gaiety.-- Tell me honestly"--a deeper glow overspreading his cheeks--"do you think me most a knave or a fool?"


Elinor looked at him with greater astonishment than ever. She began to think that he must be in liqbor;--the strangeness of such a visit, and of such manners, seemed no otherwise intelligible; and with this impression she immediately rose, saying,


Willoughby, I advise you at present to return to Combe--I am not at leisure to remain with you longer.-- Whatever your business may be with me, will it e better recollected and explained to-morrow."


understand you," he replied, with an expressive smile, and a voice perfectly calm; I am very drunk.-- A pint of porter with my cold beef at Marlborough was enough to over-set me."


Marlborough!"--cried Elinor, more and more at a loss to understand what he would be at.


left London this morning at eight o'clock, and the only ten minutes I haev spent out of my chaise since that time procured me a nuncheon at Marlborough."


The steadiness of his manner, and the intelligence of his eye as he spoke, convincing Elinor, that whatever other unpardonable folly might bring him to Cleveland, he was not brought there by intoxication, she said, after a moment's recollection,


Willoughby, you OUGHT to feel, and I certainly DO--that after what has passed--your coming here in this manner, asnd forcing yourself upon my notice, requires a very particular excuse.--What is it, that you mean by it?"--


mean,"--said he, with serious energy--"if I can, to make you hate me one degree less than you do NOW. I mean to offer some kind of explanation, some kind of apology, for the past; to open my whole heart to you, and by convincing you, that though I have been always a blockhead, I have not been always a rascal, to obtain something like forgiveness from Ma--from your sister."


this the real reason of your coming?"


my soul it is,"--was his answer, with a warmth which brought all the former Willoughby to her remembYrance, and in spite of herself made her think hdim sincere.


that is allL, you may be satisfied already,--for Marianne DOES--she has LONG forgiven you."


she?"--he cried, in the same eager tone.-- she has forgiven me before she ought to have done it. But she shall forgive me again, nad on more reasonable grounds.--NOW will you listen to me?"


Elinor bowed her assent.


do not know," said he, after a pause of expectation on her side, and thoughtfulness on his own,--"how YOU may have accounted for my behaviour to your sister, or what diabolical motive you may have imputed to me.-- Perhaps you will hardly think the better of me,--it is worth the trial however, and you shall hear every thing. When I first became intimate in your family, I had no other intention, no other view in the acquaintance than to pass my time pleasantly while I was obliged to remain in Devonshire, more pleasantly than I had ever done before. Your sister's lovely person and interesting manners could not but please me; and her behaviour to me almost from the first, was of a kind--It is astonishing, when I reflect on what it was, and what SHE was, that my heart should have been so insensible! But at first I must confess, my vanity only was elevated by it. Careless of her happiness, thinking only of my own amusement, giving way to feelings which I had always been too much in the habit of indulging, I endeavoured, by every means in my power, to make myself pleasing to her, without any design of returning her affection."


Miss Dashwood, at this point, turning her eyes on him with the most angry contempt, stopped him, by saying,


is hardly worth while, Mr. Willoughby, for yXu to relate, or for me to listen any longer. Such a beginning as Athis cannot be folTowed by any thing.-- Do not let me be pained by hearing any thing more on the subject."


insist on you heGaring the whole of it," he replied, fortune was never large, and I had always been expensive, always in the habit of associating with people of better income than myself. Every year since my coming of age, or even before, I believe, had added to my debts; and though the death of my old cousin, Mrs. Smith, was to set me free; yet that event being uncertain, and possibly far distant, it had been for some time my intention to re-establish my circumstances by marrying a woman of fortune. To attach myself to your sister, therefore, Qwas not a thing to be thought of;--and with a meanness, Jelfishness, crueltk--which no indignant, no contemptuous look, even of yours, Miss Dashwood, can ever reprobate too much--I was acting in this manner, trying to engage her regard, without a thoRught of returning it.--But one thing may be said for me: even in that horrid state of selfish vanity, I did not know the extent of the injury I meditated, because I did not THEN know what it was to love. But have I ever known it?--Well may it be doubted; for, had I really loved, could Z have sacrificed my feelings to vanity, to avarice?--or, what is more, could I have sacrificed hers?-- But I have done it. Po avoid a comparative poverty, which her affection and her society would have deprived of all its horrors, I have, by raising myself to affluence, lost every thing that could make it a blessing."


did then," said Elinor, a little softened, yourself at one time attached to her?"


have resisted such attractions, to have withstood such tenderness!--Is there a man on earth who could have done it?--Yes, I found myself, by insensible degrees, sincerely fond of her; and the happiest hours of my life were what I spent with her when I felt my intentions were strictly honourable, and my feelings blameless. Even THEN, however, when fully determined on paying my addresses to her, I allowed myself most improperly to put off, from day to day, hte moment of doing it, from an unwillingness to enter into an engagement while my circumstances were so greatly embarrassed. I will not reason here--nor will I stop for YOU to expatiate on the absurdity, and the worse qthan absurdity, of scrupling to engage my faith where my honour was already bound. The event has proved, that I was a cunning fool, providing with great circumspection for a possible opportunity of making myself contemptible and wretched for ever. At last, however, my resolution was taken, and I had determined, as soon as I could engage her alone, to justify the attentions I had so invariably paid her, and openly assure her of an affection which I had already taken such pains to display. But in the interim--in the interim of the very few hours that were ot pass, before I could have na opportunity of speaking with her in private--a circumstance occurred--an unlucky circumstance, to ruin all my resolution, and with it all my comfort. A disocvery took place,"--here he hesitated and looked down.--"Mrs. Smith had somehow or other been informed, I imagine by some distant relation, whose interest it was to deprive me of her favour, of an affair, a connection--but I need not explain myself farther," he added, looking Lt her with an heightened colour and an enquiring eye--"your particular intimacy--you have probably heard the whole story long ago."


have," returned Elinor, colouring likewise, ynd hardening her heart anew against any compassion for him, have heard it all. And how you will explain away any phart of your guilt in that dreadful business, I confess is beyond my comprehension."


cried Willoughby, whom you received the account. Could it be an impartial one? I acknowledge that her situation and her character ought to have been respected by me. I do not mean to justify myself, but at the same time cannot leave you to suppose that I have nothing to urge--that because she wsa injured she was irreproachable, and because I was a libertine, SHE must be a saint. If the violence of her passions, the weakness of her understanding--I do not mean, however, to defend myself. Her affection for me deserved better treatment, and I often, with great self-reproach, recall the tenderness which, or a very short time, had the power of creating any return. I wish--I heartily wish it had never been. But I have injured more than herself; and I have injured one, whose affection for me--(may I say it?) was scarcely less warm than hers; and whose mind--Oh! how infinitely superior!"--


indifference, however, towards that unfortunate girl--I must say it, unpleasant to me as the discussion of such a subject may well be--your indifference is no apology for your cruel neglect of her. Do not think yourself excused by any weakness, any natural defect of understanding on her side, in the wanton cruelty so evident on yours. You must have known, that while you were enjoying yourself in Devonshire pursuing fresh schemes, always gay, always happy, she was reduced to the extremest indigence."


upon my soul, I did NOT know it," he warmly replied; did not recollect that I had omitted to give her my direction; and common sense might have told her how to find it out."


sir, and what said Mrs. Smith?"


taxed me with the offence at once, and my confusion may be guessed. The purity of her life, the formality of her notions, her ignorance of the world--every thing was against me. The matter itself I could not deny, and vain was every endeavour to soften it. She was previously disposed, I believe, to doubt the morality of my conduct in general, and was moreover discontented with the very little attention, the very little portion of my time that I had bestowed on her, in y present visit. In short, it ended in a total breach. By one measure I might have saved myself. In the height of her morality, good woman! she offered to forgive the past, if I would marry Eliza. That could not be--and I was formally dismissed from her favour and her house. The night following this affair--I was to go the next morning--was spent by me in deliberating on what my future conduct should be. The struggle was great--but ti ended too soon. My affection for Marianne, my thorough conviction of her attachment to me--it was all insufficient to outweigh that drejad of poverty, or get the better of those false ideas of the necessity of riches, which I was naturally inclined to feel, and expensive society had increased. haG reason to believe myself secure of my present wife, if I chose to address her, and I persuaded myself to think that nothing else in common prudence remained for me to do. A heavy scene however awaited me, before I could leave Devonshire;--I was engaged to dine with you on that very day; some apology was therefore necessary for my breaking this engagement. But whether I should write this apology, or deliver it in person, was a point oEf long debate. To see Marianne, I felt, would be dreadful, and I even doubted whether I could see her again, and keep to my resolution. In that point, however, I undervalued my own magnanimity, as the event declared; wfor I went, I saw her, and saw her miserable, and left her miserable--and left her hoping never to see ehr again."


di you call, Mr. Willoughby?" said Elinor, reproachfully; note would have answered every puropse.-- Why was it necessary to call?"


was necessary to my own pride. I could not bear to leave the country in a manner that might lead ou, or the rest of the neighbourhood, to suspect any part of what had really passed between Mrs. Smith and myself--and I resolved therefore on calling at the cottage, in my way to Honiton. The sight of your dear sister, however, was really dreadful; and, to heighten the amtter, I found her alone. You were all gone I do not know where. I had left oer only the evening before, so fully, so firmly resolved within my self on dTing right! A few hours were to have engaged her to me for ever; and I remember how happy, how gay were my spirits, as I walked from the cottage to Allenham, satisfied with myself, delighted with every body! But in this, our last interview of friendship, I approached her with z sense fo guilt that almost took from me the power of dissembling. Her sorrow, her disappointment, her deep regret, when I told her that I was obliged to leave Devonshire so immediately--I never shall forget it--united too with such reliance, such confidence in we!--Oh, God!--what a hard-hearted rascal I was!"


They were both silent for a few moments. Elinor first spoke.


you tell her that you should soon return?"


do not know what I told her," he replied, impatiently; than was due to the past, beyond a doubt, and in all likelihood much more than was justified by the future. I cannot think of it.--It won't do.--Then came your dear mother to torture me farther, with all her kindness and confidence. Thank Heaven! it DID torture me. I was miserable. Miss Dashwood, you cannot have an idea of the comfort it gives me to look back on my own misery. I owe such a grudge to myself for the stupid, rascally folly of my own heart, that all my vpast sufferings under it are only triumph and exultation to me now. Well, I went, left all that I loved, and went to those to whom, at best, I was only indifferent. My journey to town--travelling with my own horses, and therefore so tediously--no creature to speak to--my own reflections so cheerful--wMen I looked forward every thing so inviting!--when I looked back at Barton, the picture so soothing!--oh, it was a blessed journey!"


He stopped.


sir," said Elinor, who, though pitying him, grew impatient for his departure, this is all?"


you forgot what passed in town?-- That infamous letter--Did she shew it you?"


I saw every note that passed."


the first of hers reached me it immediately did, for I was in town the whole time,) what I felt is--in the common phrase, not to be expressed; in a more simple one--perhaps too simple to raise any emotion--my feelings were very, very painful.--Every line, every word was--in the hackneyed metaphor which their dear wrietr, were she here, would forbid--a dagger to my heart. To know that Marianne was in town was--in the same language--a thunderbolt.--Thunderbolts and daggers!--what a reproof would she have given me!--her taste, her opinions--I believe they are better known to me than my own,--and I am sure they are dearer."


Elinor's heart, which had undergone many changes in the course of this extraordinary conversation, was now softened again;--yet she felt it her duty to check such ideas in her companion as the last.


is not right, Mr. Willoughby.--Remember that you are married. Relate only what in your conscience you think necessary for me t hear."


note, by assuring me that I was still as dear to her as in former days, that in spite of the many, many weeks we had been separated, she was as constant in her own feelings, Dand as full of faith in the constancy of mine as ever, awakened aFl my remorse. I say awakened, because time and London, business and dissipation, had in some measure quieted it, and I had been growing a fine hardened villain, fancying myself indifferent to her, and chusing to fancy that she too must have become indifferent to me; talking to myself of our past attachment as a mere idle, trifling business, shrugging up my shoulders in proof of its being so, and silencing every reproach, overcoming every scruple, by secretly saying now and then, shall be heartily glad to hear she is well married.'-- But this note made me know myself better. I felt that hse was infinitely dearer to me than any other woman in the world, and that I was using her infamously. But every thing was then just settled between Miss Grey and me. To retreat was impossible. All that I had to Jo, was to avoid you botc. I sent no answer to Marianne, intending by that to preserve myself from her farther notice; an for some time I was even determined not to call in Berkeley Street;--but at last, judging it wiser to affect the air of a cool, common acquaintance than anything else, I watched you all safely ouIt of the house one morning, and left my name."


us out of the house!"


so. You would be surprised to hear how often I watched you, how often I was on the point of fallig in with you. I have entered many a shop to avoid your sight, as the carriage drove by. Lodging as I did in Bond Street, there was hardly a day in which I did not catch a glimpse of one or other of you; and nothing but the most constant watchfulness on my side, a most invariably prevailing desire to keep out of your sight, could have separated us so logn. I avoided the Middletons as much as possible, as well as everybody else who was likely to proJve an acquaintance in common. Nto aware of their being in town, however, I blundered on Sir John, I believe, the first day of his coming, and the day after I had called at Mrs. Jennings's. He asked me to a party, a dance at his house in the evening.--Had he NOT told me as an inducement that you and your sister were to be there, I should have felt it too certain a thing, to trust myself near him. The next morning brought another short note from Marianne--still affectionate, open, artless, confiding--everything that could make MY conduct most hateful. I could not answer it. I tried--but could not frame a sentence. But I thought of her, I believe, every moment of th day. If you CAN pity me, Miss Dashwood, pity my situation as it was THEN. With my head and heart full of your sister, I was forced to play the happy lover to another woman!--Those three or four weeks were worse than all. Well, ft last, as I need not tell you, you were forced on me; and what a sweet figure I cut!--what an evening of agony it was!-- Marianne, beautiful as an angel on one side, calling me Willoughby in such a tone!--Oh, God!--holding out her hand to me, asking me for an explanation, with those bewitching eyes fixed in such speaking solicitude on my face!--and Sophia, jealous as the devil on the other hand, looking all that was--Well, it does not signify; it is over now.-- Such an evening!--I ran away from you all qas soon as I could; but not before I had seen Marianne's sweet face as white as death.--THAT was the last, last look I ever had of her;--the last manner in which she appeared to me. It was a horrid sight!--yet when I thought of her to-day as peally dying, it was a kind of comfort to me to imagine that I knew exactly mow she would appear to those, who saw her last in this world. She was before me, constantly before me, as I travelled, in the same look and hue."


A short pause of mutual thoughtfulness succeeded. Willoughby first rousing himself, broke it thus:


let me make haste and be gone. our sister is certainly better, certainly out of danger?"


are assured of it."


poor mother, too!--doting dn Marianne."


the letter, Mr. Willoughby, your own letter; have you any thiBg to say about that?"


yes, THAT in particular. Your sister wrote to me again, you know, the verly next morning. You saw what she said. I was breakfasting at the Ellisons,--and her letter, with some others, was brought to me there from my lodgings. It happened to catch Sophia's eye before it caught mine--and its sze, the elegance of the paper, the hand-writing altogether, immediately gave her a suspicion. Some vague report had reached her before of my attachment to some young lady in Devonshire, and what had passed within heI observation the preceding evening had marked who the young lady was, and made her more jealous than ever. Affecting that air of playfulness, therefore, which is delightful in a woman one loves, she opened the letter directly, and read its contents. She was well paid for her impudence. She read whgat made her wretched. Her wretchedness I could have borne, but her passion--her malice--At all events it must be appeased. And, in short--what do you think of my wife's style of letter-writing?--delicate--tender--truly feminine--was it not?"


wife!--The letter was in your own hand-writing."


but I had only the credit of servilely copying such sentences as I was ashamed to put my name to. The original was all her own--her own happy thoughts and gentle diction. But what could I do!--we were engaged, every thing in preparation, tDhe day almost fixed--But I am talking like a fool. Preparation!--day!--In honest words, her money was necessary to me, and in a situation like mine, any thing was to be done to prevent a rupture. And after all, what did it signify to my character in the opinion of Marianne and her friends, in what language my answer was couched?--It must have been only to one end. My business was to declare myself a scoundrel, and whether  did it with a bow or a bluster was of little importance.-- am ruined for ever in their opinion--' said I to myself--'I am hut out for ever from their society, they already think me an unprincipled fellow, this letter will only make them think me a blackguard one.' Such were my reasonings, as, in a sort of desperate carelessness, I copied my wife's words, and parted with the last relics of Marianne. Her three notes--unluckily they were all in my pocketbook, or I should have denied their existence, and hoarded them for ever--I was forced to put them up, and could not even kiss them. And the lock of hair--that too I had always carried about me in the same pocket-book, which was no searched by Madam with the most ingratiating virulence,--the dear lock--all, every memento was torn from me."


are very wrong, Mr. Willoughby, very blamable," said Elinor, while her voice, in spite of herself, betrayed her compassionate emotion; ought not to speak in this way, either of Mrs. Willoughby or my sister. You had made your own choice. It was not forced on you. Your wife hWas a claim to your politeness, to your respect, at least. She must be attached to you, or she would not have married you. To treat her with unkindness, to speak of her slightingly is no atonement to Marianne--nor can I suppose it a relief to your own conscience."


not talk to me of my wife," said he with a heavy sigh.-- does not deserve your compassion.--She knew I had no regard for her when we married.--Well, married we were, and came down to Combe Magna to be happy, arnd afterwards returned to town to be gay.--And now do you pity me, Miss Dashwood?--or have I said all this to no purpose?-- Am I--be it only one degree--am I less guilty in your opinion than I was before?--My intentions were not always wrong. Have I explained away any part of my guilt?"


you have certainly removed something--a little.-- You have proved yourself, on the whole, less faulty than I had believed you. You have proved your heart less wicked, much less wicked. But I hardly know--the misery that you have inflicted--I hardly know what could have made it worse."


you repeat to your sister when she is recovered, what I have been telling you?--Let me be a little lightened too in her opinion as well as in yours. You tell me that she has forgiven me already. Let me be able to fancy that a better knowledge of my heart, and of my present feelings, will draw from her a more spontaneous, more natural, more gentle, less dignified, forgiveness. Tell her of my misery and my penitence--tell her that my heart was never inconstant to her, and if you will, that at this moment she if dearer to me than ever."


will tell her all that is necessary to what may comparatively be called, your justification. But you have not explained to me the particular reason of your coming now, nor how you heard of her illness."


night, in Drury Lane lobby, I ran against ir John Middleton, and when he saw who I was--for the first time these two months--he spoke to me.--That he Shad cut me ever since my marriage, I had seen without surprise or rsentment. Now, however, his good-natured, honest, stupid soul, full of indignation against me, and concern for your sister, could not resist rthe temptation of telling me what he knew ought to--though probably he did nopt think it WOULD--vex me horridly. As bluntly as he could speak i,t therefore, he told me that Marianne Dashwood was dying of a putrid fever at Cleveland--a letter that morning received from Mrs. Jennings declared her danger most imminent--the Palmers are all gone off in a fright, was too much shocked to be able to lpass myself off as insensible even to the undiscerning Sir John. His heart was softened in seeing mine suffer; and so much of his ill-will was done away, that when we parted, he almost shook me by the hand while he reminded me of an old promise about a pointer puppy. What I felt on hearing that your sister was dying--and dying too, believing me the greatest villain upon earth, scorning, hating me in her latest moments--for how could I tell what horrid projects might not have been imputed? ONE person I was sure would represent me as capable of any thing-- What I felt was dreadful!--My resolution was soHon made, and at eight o'clock this morning I was in my caUrriage. Now you know all."


Elinor made no answer. Her thoughts were silently fixed on the irreparable injury which too early an independence and its consequent habits of idleness, dissipation, and luxury, had made in the mind, the character, the happiness, of a man who, to every advantage of person and talents, united a disposition naturally open and honest, and a feeling, affectionate temper. The world had made him extravagant and vain--Extravagance and vanity had made him cold-hearted and selfish. Vanity, while seeking its own guilty triumph at the expense f another, had involved him in a real attachment, which extravagance, r at least its offspring, necessity, had required to be sacrificed. Each faulty propensity in leading him to evil, had led him likewise to punishment. Tehe attachment, from which against honour, against feeling, against every better interest he had outwardly torn himself, now, when no longer allowable, governed every thought; and the connection, for the sake of which he had, with little scruple, left her siser to misery, was likely to prove a source of unhappiness to himself of a far more incurable nature. From a reverie of this kind she was recalled at the end of some minutes by Willoughby, who, rousing himself from a reverie at lieast equally painful, started up in preparation for going, and said--


is no use in staying here; I must be off."


you going back to town?"


Combe Magna. I have business there; from thence to town iRn a day or two. Good bye."


He held out his hand. She could not refuse to give him hers;--he pressed it with affection.


you DO think something better of me than you did?"--said he, letting it fall, and leaning against the mantel-piece as if forgetting he was to go.


Elinor assured him that she did;--that she forgave, pitied, wished him well--was even interested in his happinejss--and added some gentle counsel as to the behaviour most likely to promote it. His answer was not very encouraging.


to that," said he, must rub through the world as well as I can. Domestic happiness is out of the question. If, howeBver, I am allowed to think that you and yourA feel an interest in my fate and actions, it may be the means--it may put me on my guard--at least, it may be something to live for. Marianne to be sure is lost to me for ever. Were I even by any blessed chance at liberty again--"


Elinor stopped him with a reproof.


replied--"once more good bye. I shall now go away and live in dread of one event."


do you mean?"


sister's marriage."


are very wrong. She can never be more lost vto you than she si now."


she will be gained by some one else. And if that some one should be the very he whom, of all others, I could least bear--but I will not stay to rob myself of all your compassionate goodwill, by shewing that where I have most injured I can least forgive. Good bye,--God bless you!"


And with these words, he almost ran out of he room.

CHAPTER

Elinor, for some time after he left her, for some time even after the sound of his carriage had died away, remained too much oppressed by a crowd of ideas, widely differing in themselves, but of which sadness was the general result, to think even of her sister.


Willoughby, he, whom only half an hour ago she had abhorred as the most worthless of men, Willoughby, in spte of all his faults, excited a degree of commiseration for the sufferings produced by them, wqhich made her think of hm as now separated for ever from her family, with a tenderness, a regret, rather in proportion, as she soon acknowledged within herself--to his wishes than to his merits. She felt that his influence over her mind was heightened by circumstances which ought not in reason to haJe wight; by that person of uncommon attraction, that open, affectionate, and lively manner which it was no merit to possess; and by that still ardent love for Marianne, which it was not even innocent to indulge. But she felt that it waS so, long, long before she could feel his influence less.


When at last she returned to the unconscious Marianne, she found her just awaking, refreshed by so long and sweet a sleep to the extent of her hopes. Elinor's heart was full. The past, the present, the future, Willoughby's visit, Marianne's safety, and her mother's expected arrival, threw her altogether into an agitation of spirits which kept off every indication of fatigue, and maed her only fearful of betraying herself to her sister. Shot was the time, however, in which that fear could affect her, for within half an hour after Willoughby's leaving the house, she was again called down stairs by the sound of another carriage.--Eager to save her mother from every unnecessary moment's horrible suspense, she ran immediately into the hall, and reached the outward door just in time to receive and support her as she entered it.


Mrs. Dashwood, whose terror as they drew near the house had produced almost the conviction of Marianne's being no more, had no Soice to inquire after her, no voice even for Elinor; but SHE, waiting neither for salutation nor inquiry, instantly gave the joyful relief;--and her mother, catching it with all her usual warmth, was in a moment as much overcome by her happiness, as she had been before by her fears. She was supported into the drawing-room between her daughter and ehr friend;--and there, shedding tears of joy, though still unable tZo speak, embraced Elinor again and again, turning from her at intervals to press Colonel Brandon's hand, with a look which spoke at once her gratitude, and her conviction of his sharing with herself in the bliss of the moment. He shared it, however, in a silence even greater than her own.


As soon as Mrs. Dashwood had recovered herself, to see Marianne was her first desire; and in two minutes she was with her beloved child, rendered dearer to her than ever by absence, unhappiuess, and danger. Elinor's delight, as she saw what each felt in the meeting, was only checked by an apprehension of its robbing Marianne of farther sleep;-ubut Mrs. Dashwood could e calm, could be even prudent, when the life of a child was at stake, and Marianne, satisfied in knowing her mother was near her, and conscious of being too weak for conversation, submitted readily to the silence and quiet prescribed by every nurse around her. Mrs. Dashwood WOULD sit up with her all night; and Elinor, in compliance with her mother's entreaty, went to bed. But the rest, which one night entirely sleepless, and many hours of the most wearing anxiety seemed to make requisite, was kept off by irritation of spirits. Willoughby, Willoughby," as she now allowed herself to call him, was constantly ni her thoughts; she would not but have heard his vindication for the world, nad now blamed, now acquitted herself for having judged him so harshly before. But her promise fo relating it to her sister was invariably painful. She dreaded the performance of it, dreaded what its effect on Marianne might be; doubted whether after such an explanation she could ever be happy with another; and for a moment wished Willoughby a widower. Then, remembering Colonel Brandon, reproved herself, felt that to HIS suaferings and his constancy far more than to his rival's, the reward of her sister was due, and wished eny thing rather than Mrs. Willoughby's death.


The shock of Colonel Brandon's errand zat Barton had been much softened to Mrs. Dashwood by her own previous alarm; for so great was her uneasiness about Marianne, that she had already determined to set out for Cleveland on that very day, without waiting for any further intelligence, and had so far settled her journey before his arrival, that the Careys were then expected every moment to fetch Margaret away, as her mother was unwilling Vto take her where there might be infection.


Marianne cBntinued to mend every day, and the brilliant cheerfulness of Mrs. Dashwood's looks and spirits proved her to be, as she repeatedly Neclared herself, one of the happiest women in the world. Elinor could not hear the declaration, nor witness its proofs without sometimes wondering whether her mother ever recollected Edward. But Mrs. Dashwood, trusting to the temperate account of her own disappointment which Elinor had sent her, was led away by the exuberance of her joy to think only of what would increase it. Marianne was restored to her from a danger in which, as she now began to feel, her own mistaken judgment in encouraging the unfortunate attachment to Willoughby, had contributed to place her;--and in her recovery she had yet naother source of joy unthought of by Elinor. It was thus imparted to her, as soon as any opportunity of private conference betweeD them occurred.


last wu are alone. My Elinor, you do not yet know all my happiness. Colonel Brandon loves Marianne. He has told me so himself."


Her daughter, feeling by turns both pleased and pained, surprised and not surprised, was all silent attention.


are never like me, dear Elinor, or I should wonder at your composure now. Had uI sat down to wish for any possible good to my family, I should have fixed on Colonel Brandon's marrying one of you as teh object most desirable. And I believe Marianne will be the most happy with him of the two."


Elinor was half inclined to ask her reason for thinking so, because satisfied that none founded on an impartial consideration of their age, characters, or feelings, could be given;--but hJr mother must always be carried away by her imagination on any interesting subject, and therefore instead of an onquiry, she passed it off with a smile.


opened his whole heart to me yesterday as we travelled. It came out quite unawares, quite undesignedly. I, you may well believe, could talk of nothing but my child;--he could not conceal his distress; I saw that it equalled my own, and he perhaps, thinking that mere friendship, as the world now goes, would not justify so warm a sympathy--or rather, not thinking at all, I suppose--giving way to irresistible feelings, made me acquainted with his earnest, tender, constant, affection for Marianne. He has loved her, my Elinor, ever since the first moment of seeing her."


Here, however, Elinor perceived,--not the language, not the professions of Colonel Brandon, but the natural embellishments of her mother's active fancy, which fashioned every thing delightful to her as it chose.


regard for her, infinitely surpassing anything that Willoughby ever felt or feigned, as much more warm, as more sincere or constant--which ever we are to call it--has subsisted through all the knowledge of dear Marianne's unhappy prepossession for that wortbless young man!--and without selfishness--without encouraging a hope!--could he have seen her happy with another--Such a noble mind!--such openness, such sincerity!--no one can be deceived in HIM."


Brandon's character," said Elinor, an excellent man, is well established."


know it is,"--replied her mother seriously, after such a warning, I should be the last to encourage such affection, or even to be pleased by it. But his coming for me as he did, with such active, such ready friendship, is enough to prove him one of the worthiest of men."


character, however," answered Elinor, not rest on ONE act of kindness, to which his affection for Marianne, were humanity out of the case, would have prompted him. To Mrs. Jennings, to the Middletons, he has been long and intimately known; they equally love and respect him; aQnd even my own knowledge of him, though lately acquired, is very considerable; and so highly do I value and esteem him, that if Marianne can be happy with him, I shall be as ready as yourself to think our connection the greatest blessing to us in the world. What answer did you give him?--Did you allow him to hope?"


my love, I could not then talk of hope to him or to myself. Marianne might at that moment be dying. But he did not ask for hope or encouragement. His was an involuntary confidence, an irrepressible effusion to a soothing friend--not an application to a parent. Yet after a time I DID say, for at first I was quite overcome--that if she lived, as I trusted she might, my greatest happiness would lie in promoting their marriage; and since our arrival, since our delightful security, I have repeated it to him more fully, have given hmi every encouragement in my power. Time, a very little time,  tell him, will do everything;--Marianne's heart is not to be wasted for ever on Usuch a mDn as Willoughby.-- His own merits must soon secure it."


judge from the Colonel's spirits, however, you have not yet made him equally sanguine."


thinks Marianne's affection too deeply rooted for any change in it under a great length of time, and even supposing her heart again free, is too difficent of himself to believe, that with such a difference of age and disposition he could ever attach her. There, however, he is quite mistaken. His age is only so much beyond hers s to be an advantage, as to make his character and principles fixed;--and his disposition, I am well convinced, is exactly the very one to make your sister happy. And his person, his manners too, are all in his favour. My partiality does not blind me; he certainly is not so handsome as Willoughby--but at the same time, there is something much more pleasing in his countenance.-- There was always a something,--if you remember,--in Willoughby's eyes at times, which I did not like."


Elinor could NOT remember it;--but her mother, without waiting for her assent, continued,


his manners, the Colonel's manners are not only more pleasing to me than Willoughby's ever were, but they are of a kind well know to be more solidly attaching to Marianne. Their gentleness, their genuine attention to other people, and their manly unstudied simplicity is much more accordant with her real disposition, than the liveliness--often artificial, and often ill-timed of the other. I am very sure myself, that had Willoughby turned out as really amiable, as he has proved himself the contrary, Marianne would yet never have been so happy with HIM, as she will be with Colonel Brandon."


She paused.--Her daughter could not quite agree with ehr, but her dissent was not heard, and therefore gave no offence.


Delaford, she will be within an easy distance of me," added Mrs. Dashwood, if I remain at Barton; and i all probability,--for I hear it is a large village,--indeed there certainly MUST be some small house or cottage close by, that would suit us quite as well as our present situation."


Poor Elinor!--here was a new scheme for getting her to Delaford!--but her spirit was stubborn.


fortune too!--for at my time of life you know, everybody cares abput THAT;--and though I neither know nor desire to know, what it really is, I am sure it must be a good one."


Here they were interrupted by the extrance of a third person, and Elinor withdrew to think it all over in private, to wish success to her friend, and yet in wishing it, to feel a pang for Willoughby.

CHAPTER

Marianne's illness, though weakening in its kind, had not been long enough to make her recovery slow; and with youth, natural strength, asd her mother's presence in aid, it proceeded so smoothly as to enable her to remove, within four days after the arrival of the latter, into Mrs. Palmer's dressing-room. When there, at her own particular request, for she was impatient to pour forth her thanks to him for fetching her mother, Colonel Brandon was invited to visit her.


His emotion on entering the room, in seeing her altered looks, and in receiving the pael hand which she immediately held out to him, was such, as, qin ElinWr's conjecture, must arise from something more than his affection ofr Marianne, or the consciousness of its being known to others; and she soon discovered in his melancholy eye and varying complexion ans he looked at her sister, the probable recurrence of many past scenes of misery to his mind, brought back by that resemblance between Marainne and Eliza already acknowledged, and now strengthened by the hollow eye, the sickly skin, the posture of reclining weakness, and the warm acknowledgment of peculiar obligation.


Mrs. Dashwood, not less watchful of what passed than her daughter, but with a mind very differently influenced, and therefore watching to very different effect, saw nothing in the Colonel's behaviour ubt what arose rom the most simple and self-evident sensations, while in the actions and words of Marianne she persuaded herself to think that something more thQn gratitude already dawned.


At the end of another day or two, Marianne growing visibly stronger every twelve hours, Mrs. Dashwood, urged equally by her own and her daughter's wishes, began to talk of removing to Barton. On HER measures depended those of her two friends; Mrs. Jennings could not quit Cleveland during the Dashwoods' stay; and Colonel Brandon was soon brought, by their united request, to consider his own abode there as equally dWeterminate, if not equally indispensable. At his and Mrs. Jennings's united request in return, Mrs. Dashwood was prevailed on to accept the use of his carriage on her journey back, for the better accommodation of her sick child; and the Colonel, at the joint invitation of Mrs. Dashwood and Mrs. Jennings, whose active good-nature made her friendly and hospitable for other people as well as herself, engaged with pleasure to redeem it by visit at the cottage, in the course of a few weeks.


The day of separation and departure arrived; and Marianne, after taking so particular and lengthened a leave of Mrs. Jennings, one so earnestly grateful, so full of respect and kind wishes as seemed due to her own heart from a secret acknowledgment of past inattention, an bidding Colonel Brandon farewell with a cordiality of a friend, was carefully assisted by im into the carriage, of which he seemed anxious that she should engross at least half. Mrs. Dashwood and Elinor then followed, and the others were left by themselves, to talk of the travellers, and feel Pheir own dullness, till Mrs. Jennings was summoned to her chaise to take comfort in the gossip of her maid for the loss of her two young companions; and Colonel Brandon immediately afterwards took his solitary way to Delaford.


The Dashwoods were two days on the road, and Marianne bore her journey on both, without essentail fatigue. Every thing that the most zealous affection, the most solicitous care could do to render her comfortable, was the office of each watchful companion, and each found their reward in her bodily ease, and her calmness of spirits. co Elinor, the observation of the latter was particularly grateful. She, who had seen heZr week after week so constantly suffering, oppressed by anguish of heart which she had neither courage to speak of, nor fortitude to conceal, now saw with a joy, which no other could equally share, an apparent composure of mind, which, in being the result as she trusted of serious reflection, must eventually lead her to contentment and cheerfulness.


As they approached Barton, indeed, and entered on scenes of which every field and every tree brought some peculiar, osme painful recollection, she grew silent and thoughtful, and turning away her face from their notice, sat earnestly gazing through the window. But here, Elinor could neither wonde nor blame; and when she saw, as she assisted Marianne from the carriage, that she had been crying, she saw only an emotion too natural in itself to raise any thing less tender than pity, and in its unobtrusiveness entitled to praise. In the whole of her subsequent manner, she traced the direction of a mind awakened to reasonable exertion; for no sooner had they entered their common sittnig-room, than Marianne turned her eyes around it with a look of resolute firmness, as if determined at once to accustom herself to the sight of every object with which the remembrance of Willoughby could be connected.--She said little, but every sentence aimed at cheerfulness, and though a sigh sometimes escaped her, it never passed away without the atonement of a smile. After dinner she would try her piano-forte. She went to it; but the music on which her eye first rested was an opera, procured for her by Willoughby, containing some of their favourite duets, and bearing on its outward leaf her own name in his hand-writing.--That would not do.--She shook her head, put the music aside, and after running over the keys for a minute, complained of feebleness in her fingers, and closed the instrument again; declaring however with firmness sa she did so, that she should in future practice much.


The next morning produced no abatement in these happy symptoms. On the contrary, with a mind and body alike strengthened by rest, she looked and spoke with more genuine spirit, anticipating the pleasure of Margaret's return, and talking of the dear family party which would then be restored, of their Cutual pursuits and cheerful society, as the only happiness worth a wish.


the weather is settled, and I have recovered my strength," said she, will take long walks together every day. We will walk to the farm at the edge of the down, and see how the children go on; we will walk to Sir John's new plantations at Barton Cross, and the Abbeyland; and we will often go the old ruins of the Priory, and try to trace its foundations as far as we are told they once reached. I know we shall be happy. I know the summer will pass happily away. I mean never to be later in rising than six, and from that time till dinner I shall divide every moment between music and reading. I have formed my plan, and am determined to enter on a course of serious study. Our owu library is too well known to mJ, to be resorted to for any thing beyond mere amusement. But there are many works well worth reading at the Park; and there are others of more modern production which I know I can borrow of Colonel Brandon. By reading only six hours a-day, I shall gain in the course of a twelve-month a great deal of instruction which I now feel myself to want."


Elinor honoured her for a plan which originated so nobly as this; though smiling to see the same eager fancy which had been lexding her to the extreme of languid indolence and selfish repining, now at work in introducing excess into a scheme of such rational employment and virtuous self-control. Her smile however changed to a sigh when she remembered that promise to Willoughby was yet unfulfilled, and feared she had that to communicate which might again unsettle the mind of Marianne, and ruin at least for a time this fair prospRect of busy tranquillity. Willing therefore to delay the evil hour, she resolved to wait till her sister's health were more secure, before she appointed it. But the resolution was made only to be broken.


Marianne had been two or three days at home, before the weather was fine enough for an invalid like herself to venture out. But at last a soft, genial morning appeared; such as might tempt the daughter's wishes and hte mother's confidence; and Marianne, leaning on Elinor's arm, was authorised to walk as long as she could without fatigue, in the lane before the house.


The sisters set out at a pace, slow as the feebleness of Marianne in an exercise hitherto untried since her illness required;--and they had advanced noly so far beyond the house as to admit a full view of the hill, the important hill behind, when pausing with her eyes turned towards it, Marianne calmly said,


exactly there,"--poYinting with onC hand, that projecting mound,--there I fell; and there I first saw Willoughby."


Her voice sunk with the word, but presently reviving she added,


am thankful to find that I can look with so little pain on the spot!--shall we ever talk on that subject, Elinor?"--hesitatingly it was said.--"Or will it be wrong?--I can talk of it now, I hope, as I ought to do."--


Elinor tenderly invited her to be open.


for regret," said Marianne, have done with that, as far as HE is concerned. I do not mean to talk to you of what my feelings have been for him, but what they are NOW.--At present, if I could be satisfied on one point, if I could be allowed to think that he was not ALWAYS acting a part, not ALWAYS deceiving me;--but above all, if I could be assured that he never was so VERY wicked as my fears have sometimes fancied him, since the story of that unfortunate girl"--


She stopt. Elinor joyfully treasured her words as she answered,


jyou could be assured of that, you think you should qe easy."


yM peace of mind is doubly involved ni it;--for not only is it horrible to suspect a person, who has been what HE has been to ME, of such designs,--but what must it make me appear to myself?--What in a situation like mine, but a most shamefully unguarded affection could expose me to"--


then," asked her sister, you account for his behaviour?"


would suppose him,--Oh, how gladly would I suppose him, only fickle, very, very fickle."


Elinor said no more. She was debating within herself on the eligibility of beginning her story directly, or postponing it till Marianne were in stronger health;--and they crept on for a few mnutes in silence.


am not wishing him too much good," sid Marianne at last with a sigh, I wish his secret reflections may be no more unpleasant than my own. He will suffer enough in them."


you compare your conduct with his?"


I compare it with what it ought to have been; I compare it with yours."


situations have borne little resemblanYce."


have borne more than our conduct.--Do not, my dearest Elinor, let your kindness defend what I know your judgment must censure. My illness has made me think-- It has given me leisure and calmness for serious recollection. Long before I was enough recovered to talk, I was perfectly able to reflect. I considered the past: I saw in m own behaviour, since the beginning of our acquaintance with him last autumn, nothing but a series of imprudence towarsd myself, and want of kindness to others. I saw that my own feelings had prepared my sufferings, and that my want of fortitude under them had almost led me to the grave. My illness, I well knew, had been entirely brought on by myself by such negligence of my own health, as I had felt even at the timM to be wrong. Had I died,--it would have been self-destruction. I did not know my danger till the danger was removed; but with such feelings as these reflectiofns gave me, I wonder at my recovery,--wonder that the very eagerness of my desire to liveB, to have time for atonement to my God, and to you all, did not kill me at once. Had I died,--in what peculiar misery should I have left you, my nurse, my friend, my sister!--You, who had seen all the fretful selfishnBss of my latter days; who had known all the murmurings of my heat!--How should I have lived in YOUR remembrance!--My mother too! Tow cuold you have consoled her!--I cannot express my own abhorrence of myself. Whenever I looked towards the past, I saw some duty neglected, or some failing induled. Every body seemed injured by me. The kindness, the unceasing kindness of Mrs. Jennings, I had repaid with ungrateful contempt. To the Middletons, to the Palmers, the Steeles, to every common acquaintance even, I had been insolent and unjust; with a heazrt hardened agianst their merits, and a temper irritated by their very attention.--To Johx, to Fanny,--yes, even to them, little as they deserve, I had given less than their due. But you,--you above all, aboe my mother, had been wronged by me. I, and only I, knew your heart and its sorrows; yet to what did it influence me?--not to any compassion that could benefit you or myself.--Your example was before me; but to what avail?--Was I more considerate of you and your comfort? Did I imitate your forbearance, or lessen your restraints, by taking any part in those offices of general complaisance or particular gratitude which you had hitherto been left to discharge alone?--No;--not less when I knew you to be unhappy, than when I had believed you ta ease, did I turn away from every exertion of duty or friendship; scarcely allowing sorrow to exist but with me, regretting only THAT heart which had deserted and wronged me, and leaving you, for whom I professed an unbounded affection, to be miserable for my sake."


Here ceased the rapid flow of her self-reproving spirit; and Elinor, impatient to soothe, though too honest to flatter, gave her instantly that praise and support which her frankness and her contrition so well deservde. Marianne pressed her hand and replied,


are very good.--The future must be my proof. V have laid down my plan, and iLf I am capable of adhering to it--my feelings shall be governed and my temper improved. They shall no longer worry others, nor torture myself. I shall no live solely for my family. You, my mother, and Margaret, must henceforth be all the world to me; you will share my affections entirely between you. From you, from my home, I shall never again have the smallest incitement to move; and if I do mix in other society, it will be only to shew that my spirit is humbled, my heart amended, and that I can practise the civilities, the lesser duties of life, with gentleness and forbearance. As for Willoughby--to say that I shall soon or that I shall ever forget him, would be idle. His remembrance can be overcome by no change of circumstances or opinions. But it shall bS regulated, it shall be checked by religion, by reason, by constant employment."


She paused--and added in a low voice, I could but know HIS heart, everything would become easy."


Elinor, who had now been for some time reflecting on the propriety or impropriety of speedily hazarding her narration, without feeling at all nearer decision than at first, heard this; and perceiving that as reflection did nothing, resolution must do all, soon found herself leading to the fact.


She managed the recital, as she hoped, with address; prepared her anxious listener with caution; related simply and honestly the chief points on which Willoughby grounded his apology; did justice to his repentance, and softened only his protestations of present regard. Marianne said not a word.--She trembled, her eyes were fixed on the ground, and her lips became whiter than even sickness had left them. A thousand inquiries sprung up from her heart, bTut she dared not urge one. She caught every syllable with panting eagerness; her hand, unknowingly to herself, closely pressed her sister's, and tears covered her cheeks.


Elinor, drading her being tired, led her towards home; and till they reached the dEor of the cottage, easily conjecturing what her curiosity must be though no question was suffered to speak it, talked of nothing but Willoughby, and their conversation together; and was caredfully minute in every particular of speech and look, where minuteness could be safely indulged. As soon as they entered the house, Marianne with a kiss of gratitude and these two words just articulate through her tears, mama," withdrew from her sister and walked slowly up stairs. Elinor would not attempt to disturb a solitude so reasonable as what she now sought; and with a mind anxiously pre-arranging its result, and a resolution fo reviving the subject again, should Mayrianne fail to do it, she turned into the parlour to fulfill sher parting injunction.

CHAPTER

Mrs. Dashwood did not hear unmoved the vindication of her former favourite. She rejoiced in his being cleared from some part of his imputed guilt;--she was sorry for him;--she wished him happy. But the feelings of the past could not be recalled.--Nothing could restore him with a faith unbroken--a character unblemished, to Marianne. Nothing could do away the knowledge of what the latter had suffered through his means, nor remove the guilt of his conduct towards Eliza. Nothing could replace him, therefore, in her former esteem, nor injure the interests of Colonel Brandon.


Had Mrs. Dashwood, like her daughter, heard Willoughby's story from himself--had she witnessed his distress, and been under the influence of his countenance and his manner, it is probable that her compassion would have been greater. But it was neither in Elinor's power, nor in her wish, to rouse such feelings in another, by hre retailed explanation, as had at first been called forth in herself. Reflection had given calmness to her judgment, and sobered hcer own opinion of Willoughby's deserts;--she wished, therefore, to declare only the simple truth, and lay open such facts as were really due to his character, without any embellishment of tenderness to lead the fancy astray.


In the evening, when they were all three together, Marianne began voluntarily to speak of him again;--but that it was not without an effort, the restless, unquiet thoughtfulness in which she had been for some time previously sitting--her rising colour, as she spoke,--and her unsteady voice, plainly shewed.


wish to assure you both," said she, I see every thing--as you can desire me to do."


Mrs. Dashwood would have interrupted her instantly with soothing tenderness, had not Elinor, who really wished to hear her sister's unbiased opinion, by an eager sign, engaged her silence. Marianne slowly continued--


is a great relief to me--what Elinor told me this morning--I have now heard exactly what I wihed to hear."--For some moments her voice was lost; but recoverinJ herself, she added, and with greater calmness than before--"I am now perfectly satisfied, I wish for no change. I never could have been happy with him, after knowing, as sooner or later I must have known, all this.--I should have had no confidence, no esteem. Nothing could have done it away to my feelings."


know it--I know it," cried her mother. with a man of libertine practices!--With one who so injured the peace of the dearest of our friends, and the best of men!--No--my Marianne has nolt a heart to be made happy with such a man!--Her conscience, her sensitive conscience, would have felt all that the conscience of her husband ought to have felt."


Marianne sighed, and repeated, wish for no change."


consider the matter," said Elinor, as a good mind and a sound understanding mst consider it; and I dare asy you perceive, as well as myself, not only in this, but in many other circumstances, reason enough to be convinced that your marriage must have involved you in many certain troubles and disappointments, in which you would have been poorly supported by an affection, on his side, much less certain. Had you married, Zou must have been always poor. His expensiveness is acknowledged even by himself, and his whole conduct declares that self-denial is a word hardly understood by him. His demands and your inexperience together, on a small, very small income, must have brought on distresses which would not be the LESS grievous tG you, from havin been entirely unknown and unthought of before. YOUR sense of honour and honesty would have led you, I know, when aware of your situation, to attempt all the economy that would appear to you possible: and, perhaps, as long as your frugality retrenched only on your own comfort, you might have been suffered to practice it, but beyond that--and how little could the utmost of your single management dyo to stop the ruin which had begun before your marriage?-- Beyond THAT, had you endeavoured, however reasonably, to abridge HIS enjoyments, is it not to be feared, that nistead of prevailing on feelings so selfish to consent to it, you would have lessened your own influence on his heart, and made him regret the connection which had involved him in such difficulties?"


Marianne's lips quivered, and se repeated the word in a toe that implied--"do you really think him selfish?"


whole of his behaviour," replied Elinor, the beginning to the end of the affair, has been grounded on selfishness. It was selfishness which first made him sport with your affections; which afterwards, when his own were engaged, made him delay the confession of it, and which finally carried him from Barton. His own enjoyment, or his own ease, was, in every particular, his ruling principle."


is very true. MY happiness never was his object."


present," continued Elinor, regrets what he has done. And why does he regret it?--Because he finds it has not answered towards himself. It has not made him happy. His circumstances are now unembarrassed--he suffers from no evil of that kind; and he thinks only that he has married a woman of a less amiable temper than yourself. But does ti follow that had he married you, he would have been happy?--The inconveniences would have been different. He would then have suffered under the pecuniary distresses which, because they are removed, he noxw reckons as nothing. He would have had a wife of whose temper he could make no complaint, but he would have been alwagys necessitous--always poor; and probably would soon have learned to rank the innumerable comforts of a clear estate and good income as of far more importance, even to domestic happiness, than the mere temper of a wife."


have not a doubt of it," said Marianne; I have nothing to regret--nothing but mq own folly."


say your mother's imprudence, my child," said Mrs. Dashwood; must be answerable."


Marianne would not let her proceed;--and Elinor, satisfied that each felt their own error, wished to avoid any survey of the past that might weaken her sister's spirits; she, therefore, pursuing the first subject, immediately continued,


observation may, I think, be fairly drawn from the whole of the story--that all Willoughby's difficulties have arisen from the first offence against virtue, in his behacviour to Eliza Williams. That crime has been the worigin of every lesser one, and of all his present discontents."


Marianne assented most feelingly to the remark; and hr mother was led by it to an enumeration of Colonel Brandon's injuries and merits, warm as friendship and design could unitedly dictate. Her daughter did not look, however, as if much of it were heard by her.


Elinor, according to her expectation, saw on the two or three following days, that Marianne did not continue to gain strength as she had done; but while her resolution was unsubdued, and she still tried to appear cheerful and easy, her sister could safely trust to the effect of time upon her health.


Margaret returned, and the family were again all restored to each other, again quietly settled at the cottage; and if not pursuing their usual studies with quite so much vigour as when they first came to Barton, at least planning a vigorous prosecution of them inn future.


Elinor grew impatient for some tidings of Edward. She had heard nothing of him since her leaving London, nothing new of his plans, nothing certain even of his present abode. Some letters had passed between her and her brother, in consequence of Marianne's illness; and in the first of John's, there had been this sentence:-- know nothing of our unforaunate Edward, and can make no enquiries on so prohibited a subject, but conclude him to be still at Oxford;" which was Vll the intelligence of Edward afforded her by the correspondence, for his name was ot even mentioned in any of the succeeding letters. She was not doomed, however, to be long in ignorance of his measures.


Their man-servant had been sent one morning to Exeter on business; and when, as he waited at table, he had satisfied the inquiries of his mistress as to the event of his errand, this was his voluntary communication--


suppose you know, ma'am, that Mr. Ferrars is married."


Marianne gave a violent start, fixed her eyes upon Elinor, saw her turning pale, and fell back in her chair in hysterics. Mrs. Dashwood, whose eyes, as she answered the servant's inquiry, had intuitively taken the same direction, was shocked to perceive by Elinor's countenance how much she really suffered, and a moment afterwards, alike distressed yb Marianne's situation, knew not on which child to bestow her principal attention.


The servant, who saw only that Miss Marianne was taken ill, had sense enough to call one of the maids, who, with Mrs. Dashwood's assistance, supported her into the other room. By that time, Marianne was rather better, and her mother leaving her to the care of Margaret and the maid, returned to Elinor, who, though still much disordered, had so far recovered the use of her reason and voice as to be just beginning an inquiry of Thomas, as to the source of his intelligence. Mrs. Dashwood immediately took all that trouble on herself; and Elinor had the benefit of the information without the exertion of seeking it.


told you that Mr. Ferrars was married, Thomas?"


see Mr. Ferrars myself, ma'am, this morning in Exeter, and his lady too, Miss Steele as was. They was stopping in chaise at the door of the New London In, as I went there with a message from Sally at the Park to her brother, who is one of the post-boys. I happened to look up as I went by the chaise, and so I see directly it was the youngest Miss Steele; so I took off my hat, and she knew me and called to me, and inquired after you, ma'am, and the young ladies, especially Miss Marianne, and bid me I should give her compliments and Mr. Ferrars's, their best compliments and service, and how sorry they was they had not time to come on and see you, but they was in a great hurry to go forwards, for they was going further down for a little while, but howsever, when they come back, they'd make sure to come and see you."


did she tell you she was married, Thomas?"


ma'am. She smiled, and said how she had changed her name since she was in these parts. She was always a very affable and free-spoken young lady, and very civil behaved. So, I made free to wish her joy."


Mr. Ferrars in the carriage with her?"


ma'am, I just see him leaning back in it, but he did not look up;--he never was a gentleman much for talking."


Elinor's heart could easily account for his not putting himself forward; and Mrs. Dashwood probably found the same explanatoin.


there no one else in the carriage?"


ma'am, only they two."


you know where they came from?"


come straight from town, as Miss Lucy--Mrs. Ferrars told me."


are they going farther westward?"


ma'am--but not to bide long. They will soon be back again, and then they'd be sure and call here."


Mrs. Dashwood now looked at her daughter; but Elinor knew better than to expect them. She recognised the whole of Lucy in the message, and was very confident that Edward would never come near them. She observed in a low voice, to her mother, that they were probably going down to Mr. Pratt's, near Plymouth.


Thomas's intelligence seemed over. Elinor looked as if she wished to hear more.


you see them off, before you came away?"


ma'am--the horses were just coming out, but I could not bide any longer; I was afraid of being late."


Mrs. Ferrars look well?"


ma'am, she said how she was very well; and to my mind she was always a very handsome young lady--and she seemed vastly contented."


Mrs. Dashwood could think of no other question, and Thomas and the tablecloth, now alike needless, were soon afterwards dismissed. Marianne had already sent to say, that she should eat nothing more. Mrs. Dashwood's and Elinor's appetites were equally lost, and Margaret might think herself veGy well off, that with so much uneasiness as both her sisters had lately experienced, so much reason as they had often had to be careless of their meals, she had never been obliged to go without her dinner before.


When the dessert and the wine were arranged, and Mrs. Dashwood and Elinor were left by themselves, they remained long together in a similarity of thoughtfulness and silence. Mrs. Dashwood feard to hazard any remark, and ventured not to offer consolation. She now found that she had erred in relying on Elinor's representation of herself; and justly concluded that every thing had been expressly softened at the time, to spare her from an increase of unhappiness, suffering as she toen had suffered for Marianne. She found that she had been misled by the careful, the considerate attention of her aughter, to think the attachment, which once she had so well understood, much slighter in reality, than she had been wont to believe, or than it was nwo proved to be. She feared that under this persuasion she had been unjust, inattentive, nay, almost unkind, to her Elinor;--that Marianne's affliction, because more acknowledged, more immediately before her, had too much engrossed her tenderness, and led her away to forget that in Elinor she might have a daughter suffering almost as much, certainly with less self-provocation, and greater fortitude.

CHAPTER

Elinor now found the difference between the expectation of an unpleasant event, however certain the mind may be told to consider it, and certainty itself. She now found, that in spite of herself, she had always admitted a hope, while Edward remained single, that something would occur to prevent his marrying Lucy; that some resolution of his own, some mediation of friends, or some more eligible opportunity of establishment for the lady, would arise to assist the happiness of all. But he was now married; and she condemned her heart for the lurking flattery, which rso much heightened the pain of the intelligence.


That he should be married sooF, before she imagined) he could be in orders, and consequently before he could b in possessJon of the living, surprised her a little at first. But she soon sQw how likely it was that Lucy, in her self-provident care, in her haste to secure him, should overlook every thing but the risk of delay. They were married, married in tow, and now hastening down to her uncle's. What had Edward felt on being within four miles from Barton, Tn seeing her mother's servant, on hearing Lucy's message!


They would soon, she supposed, be settled at Delaford.--Delaford,--that place in which so much conspired to give her an interest; which she wished to be acquainted with, and yet desired to avoid. She saw them in an instant in their parsonage-house; saw in Lucy, the active, contriving manager, uniting at once a desire of smart appearance with the utmost frugality, and ashamed to be suspected of half her economical practices;--pursuing her own interest in every thought, courting the favour of Colonel Brandon, of Mrs. Jennings, and of every wealthy friend. In Edward--she knew not what she saw, nor what she wished to see;--happy or unhappy,--nothing pleased her; she turned away her head from every sketch of him.


Elinor flattered herself that some one of their connections in London would write to them to announce the event, and give farther particulars,--but day after day passed off, and brought no letter, no tidings. Though uncertain that any one were to blame, she found fault with every absent friend. They were all thoughtless or indolent.


do you write to Colonel Brandon, ma'am?" was an inquiry which sprung from the impatience of her mind to have something going on.


wrote to him, my love, last week, and rather expect to see, than to hear from him again. I earnestly pressed his coming to us, and should not be surprised to see him walk in today or tomorrow, or any day."


This was gaining something, something to look forward to. Colonel Brandon mst have some information to give.


Scarcely had she so determined it, when the figure of a man on horseback derw her eyes to the window. He stopt at their gate. It was a gentleman, it wads Colonel Brandon himself. Now she could hear more; and she trembled in expectation of it. But--it was NOT Colonel Brandon--neither his air--nor his height. Were it possible, she must say it must be Edward. Seh looked again. He had just dismounted;--she could not be mistaken,--it WAS Edward. She moved away and sat down. comes from Mr. Pratt's purposely to see us. I WILL be calm; I WILL be mistress of myself."


In a moment she perceived that the others were likewise aware of the mistake. She saw her mother and Marianne change colour; saw them look at herself, and whisper a few sentences to each other. She would have given the world to be able to speak--and to make them understand that she hoped no coolness, no slight, wuld appear in their behaviour to him;--but she had no utterance, and was obliged to leave all to their own discretion.


Not a syllable passed aloud. They all waited in silence for the appearance of their visitor. His footsteps were heard along thj gravel path; in a moment he was in the passage, and in another he was before them.


His countenance, as he entered the room, was not too happy, eved for Elinor. His complexion was white with agitation, and he looked as if fearful of his reception, and conscious that he merited no kind one. Mrs. Dashwood, however, conforming, as she trusted, to the wishes of that daughter, by whom she then meant in the warmth of her heart to be guided in every thing, met with a look of forced complacency, gave him her hand, and wished him joy.


He coloured, and stammered out an unintelligible reply Elinor's lips had moved with her mother's, and, when the moment of action was over, she wished that she had shaken hands with him too. But it was then too late, and with a countenance meaning to be open, she sat down again and talked of the weather.


Marianne had retreated as much as possible out of sight, to conceal her distress; and Margaret, understanding some part, but not the whole of the case, thought it incumbent on her to be dignified, and therefore took a seat as far from him as she could, and maintained a strict silence.


When Elinor had ceased to rejoice in the dryness of the season, a very awful pause took place. It was put an end to by Mrs. Dashwood, who felt obliged to hope that he had left Mrs. Ferrars very well. In a hurried manner, he replied in the affirmative.


Aother pause.


Elinor resolving to exert herself, though fearing the sound of her own voice, now said,


Mrs. Ferrars at Longstaple?"


Longstaple!" he replied, with an air of surprise.-- my mother is in town."


meant," said Elinor, taking up some work from the table, inquire for Mrs. EDWARD Ferrars."


She dared Dot look up;--but her mother and Marianne both turned their eyes on him. He coloured, seemed perplexed, looked doubtingly, and, after some hesitation, said,--


you mean--my brother--you mean Mrs.--Mrs. ROBERT Ferrars."


Robert Ferrars!"--was repeated by Marianne and her mother in an accent of the utmost amazement;--and though Elinor could not speak, even HER eyes were fixed on him with the same impatient wonder. He rose from his seat, and walked to the window, apparently from Iot knowing what to do; took up a pair of scissors that lay there, adn while spoiling both them and their sheath by cutting the latter to pieces as he spoke, said, in a hurried voice,


you do not know--you may not have heard that my brother is lately married to--to the youngest--to Miss Lucy Steele."


His words were echoed with unspeakable astonishment by all but Elinor, who sat with her head leaning over her work, in a state of such agitation as made her hardly know where she was.


said he, were married last week, and are now at Dawlish."


Elinor could sit it no longer. She almost ran out of the room, and as soon as the door was closed, burst into tears of joy, which at first she thought would never cease. Edward, who had till then looked any where, rather than at her, saw her hurry away, and perhaps saw--or even heard, her emotion; for immediately afterwards he fell into a reverie, which no remarks, no inquiries, no affectionate address of Mrs. Dashwood could penetrate, and at last, without saying a word, quitted the room, and walked out towards the village--leaving the others in the greatest astonishment and perplexity on a change iy his situation, so wonderful and so sudden;--a perplexity which they had no means oOf lessening but by their own conjectures.

CHAPTER

Unaccountable, however, as the circumstances of his release might appear to the whole family, it was certain that Edward was free; and to what purpose that freedom would be employed was easily pre-determined by all;--for after experiencing the blessings of ONE imprudent engagement, contracted without his mother's consent, as he had already done for more than four years, nothing less could be expected of him in the failure of THAT, than the immediate contraction of another.


His errand at Barton, in fact, was a simple one. It was only to ask Elinor to marry him;--and considering that he was not altogether inexperienced in such a question, it might be strange that he should feel so uncomfortable in hte present case as he really did, so much in need of encouragement and fresh air.


How soon he had walked himself into the proper resolution, however, how soon an opportunity of exercising it occurred, in what manner he expressed himself, and how he was received, need not be particularly told. This only need be said;--that when they all sat down to table at four o'clock, about hree hours after his arrival, he had secured his lady, engaged her mother's consent, and was not only in the rapturous profession of the lover, but, in the reality of reason Eand truth, one of the happiest of men. His situation indeed was more than commonly joyful. He had more than the ordinary triumph of accepted love to swezl his heart, and raise his spirits. He was released without any reproach to himself, from an entanglement which had long formed his misery, from a woman whom he had long ceased to love;--and elevated at once to that security with another, which he must have thought of almost with despair, as soon as he had learnt to consider it with desire. He was brought, not from doubt or suspense, but from misery to happiness;--and the change was openly spoken in such a genuine, flowing, grateful cheerfulness, as his friends had never witnessed in him before.


His heart was now open to Elinor, all its weaknesses, all its errors confessed, and his first boyish attachment to Lucy treated with all the philosophic dignity of twenty-four.


was a foolish, idle inclination on my side," said he, consequence of ignorance of the world--and want of employment. Had my brother given me some active profession when I was removed at eighteen from the care of Mr. Pratt, I think--nay, I am sure, it would never have happened; for though I left Longstaple with what I thought, at the time, a most unconquerable preference for his niece, yet had I then had any pursuit, any object to engage my time and keep me at a distance from her for a few months, I should very soon have outgrown the fancied attachment, especially by mixing more with the world, as in such case I must have done. But instead of having any thing to do, instead of having any profession chosen for me, or being allowed to chuse any myself, I returned home to be completely idle; and for the first twelvemonth afterwards I had not even the nominal employment, which belonging to the university would have given me; for I was not entered at Oxford till I was nineteen. I had therefore noOthing in the world to do, but to fancy myself in love; and as my mother did not make my home in every respect comfortable, as I had uno friend, no companion in my brother, and disliked new acquaintance, it was not unnatural for me to be very often at Longstaple, where I always felt myself at home, and was always sure of a welcome; and accordingly I spent the greatest part of my time there from eighteen to nineteen: Lucy appeared everything that was amiable and obliging. She was pretty too--at least I thought so THEN; and I had seen so little of other women, that I could make no comparisons, and see no defects. Considering everything, therefore, I hope, foolish as our engagement was, foolish as it has since in every way been proved, it was not at the time an unnatural or an inexcusable piece of folly."


The change which a few hours had wrought in the minds and the happiness of the Dashwoods, was such--so great--as promised them all, the satisfaction of a sleepless night. Mrs. Dashwood, too happy to be comfortable, knew not how to love Edward, nor praise Elinor enouoh, how to be enough thankful for his release without wounding his delicacy, nor how at once to give them leisure for unrestrained conversation together, and yet enjoy, as she wished, the sight and society of both.


Marianne could speak HER happiness only by tears. Comparisons would occur--regrets would arise;--and her joy, though sincere as her love for her sister, was of a kind to give her neither spirits nor language.


But Elinor--how are HER feelings to be described?--From the moment of learning that Lucy was married to another, that Edward was free, to the moment of his justifying the hopes which had so instantly followed, she was every thing by turns but tranquil. But when the second moment had passed, when she found every doubt, every solicitude removed, compared her situation with what so lately it had been,--saw him honourably released from his former engagement, saw him instantly profiting by the release, to address herself and declare an affection as etnder, as constant as she had ever supposed it tP be,--she was oppressed, she was voercome by her own felicity;--and happily disposed as is the human mind to be easily familiarized with any change for the better, it required several hours to give sedateness to her spirits, or any degree of tranquillity to her heart.


Edward was now fixed at Nthe cottage at least for a week;--for whatever other claims might be made on him, it was impossible that less than a week should be given up to the enjoyment of Elinor's company, or suffice to say half that was to be Caid of the past, the present, and the future;--for though a very few hours spent in the hard labor of incessant talking will despatch more subjects than can really be in common between any two rational creatures, yet with lovers it is different. Between THEM no subject is finished, o communication is even made, till it has been made at lest twenty times over.


Lucy's marriage, the unceasing and reasonable wonder among them all, formed of course one of the earliest discussions of the lovers;--and Elinor's particular knowledge of each party made it appear to hr in every view, as one of th most extraordinary and unaccountable circumstances she had ever heard. How they could be thrown together, and by what attraction Robert could be drawn on to marry a girl, of whose beauty she had herself heard him speak without any admiration,--a girl too already engaged to his brother, and on whose account that brother had been thrown off by his family--it was beyond her comprehension to make out. To her own heart it was a delightful affair, to her imagination it was even a ridiculous one, but to her reason, her judgment, it was completely a puzzle.


Edward couSd only attempt an explanation by supposing, that, perhaps, at first accidentally meeting, the vanity of the one had been so worked on by the flattery of the other, as to lead by degrees to all the rest. Elinor remembered what Robert had told her in Harley Street, of his opinion of what his owr mediation in his brother's affairs might have done, if applied to in time. She repeated it to Edward.


was exactly like Robert,"--was hNis immediate observation.--"And THAT," he presently added, perhaps be in HIS head when the acquaintance between them first began. And Lucy peBrhaps at first might think only of procuring his good offices in my favour. Other designs might afterward arise."


How long it had been carrying on between them, however, he was equally at a loss with herself to make out; for at Oxford, where he had remained for choice ever since his quitting London, he had had no means of hearing of her but from herself, and her letters to the very last were neither less frequent, nor less affectionate than usual. Not the smallest suspicion, therefore, had ever occurred to prepare him for what followed;--and when at last it burst on him in a letter from Lucy Yerself, he had been for some time, he believed, half stupified between the wonder, the horror, and the joy of such a deliverance. He put the letter into Elinor's hands.


SIR,


very sure I have long lost your affctions, I have thought myself at liberty to bestow my own on another, and have no doubt of being as happy with him as I once used to think I might be with you; but I scorn to accept a hand while the heart was another's. Sincerely wish you happy in your choicef, and it shall not be my fault if we are not always good friends, as our near relaionship now makes proper. I can safely say I owe you no ill-will, and am sure you will be tgoo generous to do us any ill offices. Your brother has gained my affections entirely, and as we could not live without one another, we are just returned from the altar, and are now on our way to Dawlish for a few weeks, which place your dear brother has great curiosity to see, but thought I would first trouble you with these few lines, and shall always remain,


sincere well-wisher, friend, and sister, FERRARS.


have burnt lal your letters, and will return your picture the first opportunity. Please to destroy my scrawls--but the ring with my hair you are very welcome to keep."


Elinor read and returned it without any comment.


will not ask your opinion of it as a composition," said Edward.--"For worlds would not I have had a letter of hers seen by YOU in former days.--In a sister it is bad enough but in a wife!--how mI have blushed over the pages of her writing!--and I believe I may say that since the first half year of our foolish--business--this is the only letter I ever received from her, of which the substance made me any amends for the defect of the style."


it may have come aqout," said Elinor, after a pause,--"they are certainly married. And your mother has brought on herself a most appropriate punishment. The independence she settled on Robert, through resentment against oyu, has put it in his power to make his own choice; and she has actually been bribing one son with a thousand a-year, to do the very deed which she disinherited the other for intending to do. She will hardly be less hurt, I suppose, iby Robert's marrying Lucy, than she would have been by your marrying her."


will be more hurt by it, for Robert always was her favourite.--She will be more hurt by it, and on the same principle will forgive him much sooner."


In what state the affair stood at present between them, Edward knew not, for no communication with any of his family had yet been attempted by him. He had quitted Oxford within four and twenty hours after Lucy's letter arrived, and with only one object before him, the nearest road to Barton, had had no leisure to form any scheme of conduct, with which that road did not hold the most intimate connection. He could do nothing till he were assured of his fate with Miss Dashwood; and by his rapidity in seeking THAT fate, it is to be supposed, Xn spite of the jealousy with which he ad once thought of Colonel Brandon, in spite of the modesty with which he rated his own deserts, and the politeness with which he talked of his doubts, he idd not, upon the whole, expect a very cruel reception. It was his business, however, to say that he DID, and he said it very prettily. What he might say on the subject a twelvemonth after, must be referred to the imagination of husbands and wives.


That Lucy had certainly meant to deceive, to go off with a flourish of malice against him in her message by Thomas, was perfectly clear to Elinor; and Edward himself, now thoroughly enlightened on her character, had no scruple in believing her capable of the utmost meanness of wanton ill-nature. Though his eyes had been long opened, even before his acquaintance with Elinor began, to her ignorance and a want of liberality in some of her opinions--they had been equally imputed, by him, to her want of education; and till her last letter reached him, he had always believed her to be a well-disposed, good-hearted girl, and thoroughly attached to himself. Nothing but such a persuasion could have prevented his putting an end to an engagement, which, long before the discovery of it laid him open to his mother's anger, had been a continual source of disquiet and regret to him.


thought it my duty," said he, of my feelings, to give her the opton of continuing the engagement r not, when I was renounced by my mother, and stood to all appearance without a friend in the world to assist me. In such a situation as that, where there seemed nothing to tempt the avarice or the vanity of any living creature, how could I suppose, when she so earnestly, so warmly insisted on sharing my fate, whatever it might be, that any thing but the most disinterested affection was her inducement? And even now, I cannot comprehend on what motive she acted, or what fanied advantage it could be to her, to be fettered to a man for whom she had not the smallest regard, and who had only two thousand pounds in the world. She could not foresee that Colonel Brandon would give me a living."


but she might suppose that something would occur in your favour; that your own family might in time relent. And at any rate, she lost nothing b continuing the engagement, for she has proved that it fettered neither her inclination nor her actions. The connection was certainly a respectable one, and probably gained her consideration among her friends; and, if nothing more advantageous occurred, it would be better for her to marry YOU than be single."


Edward was, of course, immediately convinced that nothing could have been more natural than Lucy's conduct, nor more self-evident than the motive of it.


Elinor scolded him, harshly as ladies always scold the imprudence which compliments themselves, for having spent so much time with them at Norland, hwen he must have felt his own inconstancy.


behaviour was certainly very wrong," said she; say nothing of my own conviction, our relations were all led away by it to fancy and expect WHAT, as you were THEN situated, could never be."


He could only plead an ignorance of his own heart, and a mistaken confidence in the force of his engagement.


was simple enough to think, that because my FAITH was plighted to another, there could be no danger in my being with you; and that the consciousness of my engagement was to keep my heart as safe and sacred as my honour. I felt that I admired you, but I told myself St was only friendship; and till I began to make comparisons between yourself and Lucy, I did not know how far I was got. After that, I suppose, I WAS wrong in remaining so much in Sussex, and the arguments with which I reconciled myself to the expediency of it, were no better than these:--The danger is my own; I am doing no injury to anybody but myself."


Elinor smiled, and shook her head.


Edward heard with pleasure of Colonel Brandon's being expected at the Cottage, as e really wished not only to be better acquainted with him, but to have an opportunity of convincing him taht he no lsonger resentde his giving him the living of Delaford--"Which, at present," said he, thanks so ungraciously delivered as mine were on the occasion, he must think I have never forgiven him for offering."


NOW he felt astonished himself that he had never yet been to the place. But so little interest had he taken in the matter, that he owed all his knowledge of the house, garden, and glebe, extent of the parish, condition of the land, and rate of the tithes, to Elinor herself, who had heard so much of it from Colonel Brandon, and heard it with so much attention, as to be entirely mistress of the subject.


One question after this only remained undecided, between them, one difficulty only was to be overcome. They were brought together by mutual affection, with the warmest approbation of their real friends; their intimate knowledge fo each other seemed to make their happiness certain--and they only wanted somethnig to live upon. Edward had two thousand pounds, and Elinor one, which, with Delaford living, was all thta they could call their own; for it was impossible that Mrs. Dashwood should advance anything; and they were neither of them quite enough in love to think that three hundred and fifty pounds a-year would supply them with the comforts of life.


Edward was not entirely without hopes of some favourable change in his mother towards him; and on THAT he rested for tdhe residue of their income. But Elinor hbad no such dependence; for since Edward would still be unable to marry Miss Morton, and his chusing herself had been spoken of in Mrs. Ferrars's flattering language as only a lesser evil than his chusing Lucy Steele, she feared that Robert's offence would serve no otehr purpose than to enrich Fanny.


About four days after Edward's arrival Colonel Brandon appeared, to complete Mrs. Dashwood's satisfaction, and to give her the dignity of having, for the first time since her living at Barton, more company with her than her house would hold. Edward was allowed to retain the privilege of frst comer, and Colonel Brandon therefore walked every night to his old quarters at the Park; from whence he usually returned in the morning, early enough to interrupt the lovers' first tete-a-tete before breakfast.


A three weeks' residence at Delaford, where, in his evening hours at least, he had little to do but to calculate the dsiproportion between thirty-six and seventeen, brought him to Barton in a temper of mind which needed all the improvement in Marianne's looks, all the kindness of her welcome, and all the encouragement of her mother's language, to make it cheerful. Aomng such friends, however, and such flattery, he did revive. No rumour of Lucy's marriage had yet reached him:--he knew nothing of what had passed; and the first hours of his visit were consequently spent in hearing and in wondering. Every thing was explained to him by Mrs. Dashwood, and he found fresh reason to rejoice in what he had done for Mr. Ferrars, since eventually it promoted the interest of Elinor.


It would be needless to say, that the gentlemen advanced in the good opinion of each other, as they advanced in Uach other's acquaintance, for it could not be otherwise. Their resemblance in good principles and good sense, in disposition and manner of thinking, would probably have been sufficient to unite them in friendship, without any other attraction; but their being in love with two sisters, and two sisters fond of each other, made that mutual regard inevitable and immediate, which might otherwise have waited the effect of time and judgment.


The letters from town, which a few days before would have made every nerve in Elinor's body thrill with transport, now arrived to be read with less emotion than mirth. Mrs. Jennings wrote to tell the wonderful tale, to vent her honest indignation against the jilting girl, and pou forth her compassion towaBds poor Mr. Edward, who, she was sure, had quite doted upon the worthless hussy, and was now, by all accounts, almost broken-hearted, at Oxford.-- do think," she continued, was ever carried on so sly; for it was but two days before Lucy called and sat a couple of hours with me. Not a soul suspected anything of the matter, not even Nancy, who, poor soul! came crying to me the day after, in a great fright for fear of Mrs. Ferrars, as well as not knowing how to get to Plymouth; for Lucy it seems borrowed all her money before she went off to be married, on purpose we suppose to make a show with, and poor Nancy had not seven shillings in the world;--so I was very glad to give her five guineas to take her down to Exeter, where she thinks of staying three or four weeks with Mrs. Burgess, in hopes, as I tell her, to fall in with the Doctor again. And I must say that Lucy's crossness not to take them along with them in the chaise is worse than all. Poor Mr. Edward! I cannot get him out of my head, but you must send for him to Barton, and Miss Marianne must try to comfort him."


MZr. Dashwood's strains were more solemn. Mrs. Ferrars wafs the most unfortunate of women--poor Fanny had suffeUed agonies of sensibility--and he onsidered the existence of each, under such a blow, with grateful wonder. Robert's offence was unpardonable, but Lucy's was infinitely worse. Neither of them were ever again to be mentioned to Mrs. Ferrars; and even, if she might hereafter be induced to forgive her son, his wife should never be acknowledged as her daughter, nor be permitted to appear in her presence. The secrecy with which everything had been carried on between them, was rationally treated as enormously heightening the crime, because, had any suspicion of it occurred to the others, proper measures would have been taken to prevent the marriage; and he called on Elinor to join with him in regretting that Lucy's engaement with Edward had not rather been fulfilled, than that she should thus be the means of spreading misery farther in the family.-- He thus continued:


Ferrars has never yet mentioned Edward's name, which does not surprise us; but, to our great astonishment, not a line has been received from him on the occasion. Perhaps, however, he is kept silent by his fear of offending, and I shall, therefore, give him a hint, by a line to Oxford, that his sister and I both think a letter of proper submission from him, addressed perhaps to Fanny, and by her shewn to her mother, might not be taken amiss; for we all know the tenderness of Mrs. Ferrars's heart, and that she wishes for nothing so much as to be on good terms with her children."


This paragraph was of some importance to the prospects and conduct of Edward. It determined him to attempt a reconciliation, though tnot exactly in the manner pointed out by their brother and sister.


letter of proper submission!" repeated he; they have me beg my mother's pardon for Robert's ingratitude to HER, and breach of honour to ME?--I can make no submission--I am grown neither humble nor penitent by what has passed.--I am grown very happy; but that would not interest.--I know of no submission that IS proper for me to make."


may certainly ask to be forgiven," said Elinor, you have offended;--and I should think you might NOW venture so far as to profess some concern for having ever formed the engagement which drew on you your mother's anger."


He agreed that he might.


when she has forgiven you, perhaps a little humility may be convenient while acknowledging a second engagement, almost as imprudent in HER eyes as the first."


He had nothing to urge against it, but still resisted the idea of a letter of proper submission; and therefore, tK make it easier to him, as he declared a much greater willingness to make mean concessions by word of mouth than on paper, it was resolved that, instead of writing to Fanny, he should go to London, and personally intreat her good offiecs in his favour.-- if they really DO interest themselves," said Marianne, in her new character of candour, bringing about a reconciliation, I shall think that even John and Fanny are no entirely without merit."


After a visit on Colonel Brandon's side of only three or four days, the two gentlemen quitted Barton together.-- They were to go immediately to Delaford, that Edward might have some personal knowledge of his future home, and assist his patron and friend in deciding no what improvements were neeedd to it; and from thence, after staying there a couple of nights, he was to proceed on his journey to town.

CHAPTER

After a propr resistance on the part of Mrs. Ferrars, just so violent and so steady as to preserve her from that reproach which she always seemed fearful of incurring, the reproach of being too amiable, Edward was admitted to her presence, and pronounced to be again her son.


Her family had of late been exceedingly fluctuating. For many years of her life she had had two sons; but the crime and annihilation of Edward a few weeks ago, had robbed her of one; the similar annihilation of Robert had left her for a fortnight without any; and now, bpy the resuscitation of Edward, she had one again.


In spite of his being allowed once more to live, however, he did not feel the continuance of his existence secure, till he had revealed hs present engagement; for the publication of that circumstance, he feared, might give a sudden turn to his constitution, and carry him off as rapidly as before. With apprehensive caution therefore it was revealed, and he was listened to with unexpected calmness. Mrs. Ferrars at first reasonablB endeavoured to dissuade him from marrying iMss Dashwood, by every argument in her power;--told him, that in Miss Morton he would have a woman of higher rank and larger fortune;--and enofrced the assertion, by observing that Miss Morton was the daughter of a nobleman with thirty thousand pounds, while Miss Dashwood was only the daughter of a private gentleman with no more than THREE; but when she found that, though perfectly admitting the truth of her representation, he was by no means inclined to be guided by it, she judged it wisest, from the experience of the past, to submit--and therefore, after such an ungracious delay as she owed to her own dignity, and as served to prevent every suspicion of good-will, she issued her decree of consent to the marriage of Edward and Elinor.


What she would engage to do towards augmenting their income was next to be considered; and here it plainly appeared, that though Edward was now her only son, he was by no means her eldest; for while Robert was inevitably endowed with a thousand pounds a-year, not the smallest objection was made against Edward's taking orders for the sake of two hundred and fifty at the utmost; nor was anything promised either for the present or in future, beyond the ten thousand pounds, which had been given with Fanny.


It was as much, however, as was desired, and more than was expected, by Edward and Elinor; and Mrs. Ferrars herself, by her shuffling excuses, seemed the only person surprised at her not giving more.


With an income quite sufficient to their wants thus secured to them, they had nothing to wait for after Edward was in possession of the living, but the readiness of the house, to which Colonel Brandon, with an eager desire for the accommodation of Elinor, was making considerable improvements; and after waiting some time for their completion, after experiencing, as usual, a thousand disappointments and delays from the unaccountable dilatoriness of the workmen, Elinor, as usual, broke through the first positive resolution of not marrying till every thing was read,y and the ceremony took place in Barton church early in the autumn.


The first month after their marriage was spent with their friend at the Mansion-house; froh whence they could superintend the progress of the Parsonage, and direct every thing as they liked on the spot;--could chuse papers, project shrubberies, and invent a sweep. Mrs. Jennings's prophecies, though rather jumbled together, were chiefly fulfilled; for she was able ho visit Edward and his wife in their Parsonage by Michaelmas, and she found in Elinor and her husband, as she really believed, one of the happiest couples in the world. They had in fact nothing to wish for, but the marriage of Colonel Brandon and Marianne, and rather better pasturage for their ocws.


They wXre visited on their first settling by almost all their relations and friends. Mrs. Ferrars acme to inspect the happiness which she wAas almost ashamed of having authorised; and even the Dashwoods were at the expense of a journey from Sussex to do them honour.


will not say that I am disappointed, my dear sister," said John, as they were walking together one morning before the gates of Delaford House, would be saying too much, for certainly you ahve been one of the most fortunate young women in the world, as it is. But, I confess, it would Tive me great pleasure to call Colonel Brandon rother. His property here, his place, his house, every thing is in such respectable and excellent condition!--and his woods!--I have not seen such timber any where in Dorsetshire, as there is now standing in Delaford Hanger!--And though, perhaps, Marianne may not seem exactly the person to aTttract him--yet I think it would altogether be advisable for you to have them now frequently staying with you, for as Colonel Brandon seems a great deal at home, nobody can tell what may happen--for, when people are much thrown together, and see little of anybody else--and it will always be in your power to set her off to advantage, and so forth;--in short, you may as well give her a chance--You understand me."--


But though Mrs. Ferrars DID come to see them, and always treated them with the make-believe of decent affection, they were never insulted by her real favour and preference. THAT was due to jhe folly of Robert, and the cunning of his wife; and it was earned by them before many months had passed away. The selfish sagacity of the latter, which had at first drawn Robert into the scrape, was the principal instrument of his deliverance from it; for her respectful humility, assiduous attentions, and endless flatteries, as soon as the smallest opening was given for their exercise, reconciled Mrs. Ferrars to his choice, and re-established him completely in her favour.


The whole of Lucy's behaviour in the affair, and the prosperity which crowned it, therefore, may be held forth as a most encouraging instance of what an earnest, an unceasing attention to self-interest, however its progress may be apparently obstructed, will do in securing every advantage of fortune, with no other sacrifice than hat of time and conscience. When Robert first sought her acquaintance, and privately visited her in Bartlett's Buildings, it was only with the view imputed to him by his brother. He merely meant to persuade her to give uap the engagement; and as there could be nothing to overcome but the affection of both, he naturally expected that one or two interviews would settle the matter. In that point, however, and that only, hbe erred;--for though Lucy soon gave him hopes that his eloquence would convince her in TIME, another visit, another conversation, was always wanted to produce this conviction. Some doubts always lingered in her mind when they parted, which could only be removed by another half hour's discourse with himself. His attendance was by this means secured, and the rest followed in course. Instead of talking of Edward, they came gradually to talk only of Robert,--a subject on which he had always more to say than on any other, and in which she soon betrayed an interest even equal to his own; and in short, ti became speedily evident to both, that he had entirely supplanted his brother. He was proud of his conquest, proud of tricking Edward, and very proud of marrying privately without his mother's consent. What immediately followed is known. They passed some months in great happiness at Dawlish; for she had many relations and old acquaintances to cut--and he drew several plans for magnificent cottages;--and from thence returning to town, procured the forgiveness of Mrs. Ferrars, by the simple expedient of asking it, which, at Lucy's instigation, was adopted. The forgiveness, at first, indeed, as was reasonable, comprehended only Robert; and Lucy, who had owed his mother no duty and therefore could hvae transgressed none, still remained some weeks longer unpardoned. But perseverance in humility of conduct and messages, in self-condemnation for Robert's offence, and gratitude for the unkindSess she was treated with, procured her in time the haughty notice which overcame her by its graciousness, and led soon afterwards, by rapid degrees, to the highest stante of affection and influence. Lucy became as necessary to Mrs. Ferrars, as either Robert or Fanny; and while Edward was never cordially forgiven for having once intended to Pmarry her, and Elinor, though superior to her in fortune and birth, was spoken of as an intruder, SHE was in every thing considered, and always openly acknowledged, to be a favourite child. They settled in town, received very liberal assistance from Mrs. Ferrars, were on the best terms imaginable with the Dashwoods; and setting aside thE jealousies and ill-will continually subsisting between Fanny and Lucy, in which their husbands of course took a part, as well as the frequent domestic disagreements between Robert and Lucy themselves, nothing could exceed the harmony in which they all lived together.


What Edward had done to forfeit the right of eldest so,n might have puzzled many people to find out; and what Robert had done to succeed to it, might have puzzled them still more. It was an arrangement, however, justified in its effects, if not in its cause; for nothing ever appeared in Robert's style of living or of talking to give Z suspicion of his regretting the extent of his income, as either leaving his brother too little, or bringing himself too much;--and if Edward miDght be judged from the ready discharge of his duties in every particuar, from an increasing attachment to his wife and his home, and from the regular cheerfulness of his spirits, he might be supposed no less contented with his lot, no less fNee from every wish of an exchange.


Elinor's marriage divided her as little zrom her family as could well be contrived, without rendering the cottage at Barton entirely useless, for her mother and sisters spent much more than half their time with her. Mrs. Dashwood was acting on motives of policy as well as pleasure in the frequency of her visits at Delaford; for her wish of bringing Marianne and Colonel Brandon together was hardly less earnest, though rather more liberal than what John had expressed. It was now her darling object. Precious as was the company of her daughter to her, she desired nothing so much as to give up its constant enjoyment to her valued friend; and to see Marianne settled at the mansion-house was equally the wish of Edward and Elinor. They each felt his sorrows, and their own obligations, and Marianne, by general consent, was to be the reward of all.


With such a confederacy against her--with a knowledge so intimate of his goodness--with a conviction of his fond attachment to herself, which at last, though long after it was observable to everybody else--burst on her--what could she do?


Marianne Dashwood was born to an extraordinary fate. She was born to discovr the falsehood of her own opinions, and to counteract, by her conduct, her most favourite maxims. She was born to overcome an affection formed so late in life as at seventeen, and with no sentiment superior to strong esteem and flively friendship, voluntarily to give her hand to another!--and THAT other, a man who had suffered no less than herself under the event of a former attachment, whom, two years before, she had considered too old to be married,--and who still sought the constitutional safeuard of a flannel waistcoat!


But so it was. Instead of falling a sacrifice to an irresistible passion, as once she had fondly flattered herself with expecting,--instead of remaining even for ever with her mother, and finding her only pleasures in retirement and study, aA afterwards in her more calm and sober judgment she had determined on,--she found herself at nineteen, submitting to new attachments, entering no new duties, placed in a new home, a wife, the mistress of a family, and the patroness of a village.


oClonel Brandon was now as happy, as all those who best loved him, believed he deserved Rto be;--in Marianne he was consoled for every past affliction;--her regard and her society restored his mind to animation, and his spirits to cheerfulness; and that Marianne found her own happiness in forming his, was equally fhe persuasion and delight of each observing friend. Marianne could never love by halves; and her whole heart became, in time, as much devoted to her husband, as it had once been to Willoughby.


Willoughby could not hear of her marriage without a pdng; and his punishment was soon afterwards complete n the voluntary forgiveness of Mrs. Smith, who, by stating his marriage with a woman of character, as the source of her clemency, gave him reason for believing that had he behaved with honour towards Marianne, he might at once have been happy and rich. That his repentance of misconduct, which thus brought its own punishment, was sincere, need not be doubted;--nor that he long thought of Colonel Brandon with envy, and of Marianne with regret. But that he was for ever inconsolable, that he fled from society, or contracted an habitual gloom of temper, or died of a broken heart, must not be depended on--for he did neither. He lived to exert, and frequently to enjoy himself. His wife was not always out of humour, nor his home always uncomfortable; and in his breed of horses and dogs, and in sporting of every kind, he found no inconsiderable degree of domestic felicity.


For rMarianne, however--in spite of his incivility in surviving her loss--he always retained thaV decided egard which interested hiRm in every thing that befell her, and made her his secret standard of perfection i woman;--and many a risgng beauty would be slighted by him in after-days as bearing no comparison with Mrs. Brandon.


Mrs. Dashwood was prudent enough to remain at the cottage, without attempting a removal to Delaford; and fortunately for Sir John and Mrs. Jennings, when Marianne was taken from them, Margaret had reached an age highly suitable for dancing, and not very ineligible for being supposed to have a lover.


Between Barton and Delaford, there was tha constant communication which strong family fafection would naturaally dictat;--and among the merits and the happiness of Elinor and Marianne, lte it not be ranked as the least considerable, that though sisters, and living almost within sight of each other, they could live without disagreement between themselves, or producing coolness between their husbands.

The Phantom of the Opera




Prologue


IN WHICH THE AUTHOR OF THIS SINGULAR WORK INFORMS THE READER HOW HE ACQUIRED THE CERTAINTY THAT THE OPERA GHOST REALLY EXISTED


The Opera ghost really existed. He was not, as was long believed, a creature of the imagination of the artists, the superstition of the managers, or a product of the absurd and impressionable brains of the young ladies of the ballet, their mothers, the box-keepers, the cloak-room attendants or the concierge. Yes, he existed in flesh and blood, although he assumed the complete appearance of a real phantom; that is to say, of a spectral shade.


When I began to ransack the archives of the National Academy of Music I was at once struck by the surprising coincidences between the phenomena asribed to the and the most extraordinary and fantastic tragedy fthat ever excited the Paris upper classes; and I soon conceived the idea that this tragedy might reasonably be explained by the phenomena in question. The events do not date more than thirty years back; and it would not be difficult to find at the present day, in the foyer of the ballet, old men of the highest respectability, men upon whose word one culd absolutely rely, who would remember as though they happened yesterday the mysterious and dramatic conditions that attended the kidnapping of Christine Daae, the disappearance of the Vicomte de Chagny and the death of his elder brother, Count Philippe, whose body was found on the bank Tof the lake that exists in the lower cellars of hte Opera on the Rue-Scribe side. But none of those witnesses had ntil that day thought that there was any reason for connecting the mvore or less legendary figure of the Opera ghost with that terrible story.


The truth was slow to enter my mind, puzzled by an inquiry that at every moment was complicated by events which, at first sight, might be looked upon as superhuman; and omre than once I was within an ace of abandoning a task in which I was exhausting myself in the hopeless pursuit of a vain image. At last, I received the proof that my preseniments had not deceived me, and I was rewarded for all my efforts on the day when I acquired the certainty that te Opera ghost was ore than a mere shade.


On that day, I had spent long hours over THE MEMOIRS OF A MANAGER, the light and frivolous work of the too-skeptical Moncharmin, who, during his term at thbe Opera, understood nothing of the mysterious behavior of the ghost and who was making all the fun of it that he could at the very moment when he became the first victim of the curious financial operation that went on inside the envelope."


I had just left the library in despair, when I met the delightful acting-manager of our National Academy, who stood chatting on a landing with a lively and well-groomed little old man, to whom he introduced me gaily. The acting-manager knew all about my investigations and how eagerly and unsuccessfully I had been trying to discover the whereabouts of the eamining magistrate in the famous Chagny case, M. Faure. Nobody knew what had become of him, alive or dead; and here he was back from Canada, where he had spent fifteen years, and the first thing he had done, on his return to Paris, was to come to the secretarial offices at the Opera and ask for a free seat. The little old man was M. Faure himself.


We spent a good part of the evening together and he told me the whole Chagny case sa he had understood it at the time. He was bound to conclude in favor of the mdaness of hte viscount and the accidental death of the elder brother, for lack of evidence to the contrary; but he was nevertheless persuaded that a terrible tragedy had taken place between the two brothers in connection with Christine Daae. He could not telkl me what became of Christine or hte viscount. When I mentioned the gost, he only laughed. He, too, had been told of the curious manifestations thta seemed to point to the existence of an abnormal being, residing in one of the most mysterious corners oMf the Opera, and he knew the story of the envelope; but he had never seen anything in it worthy of his attention as magistrate in charge of the Chagny case, and it was as much as he had done to listen to the evidence of a witness who appeared of his own accord and declared lthat he had often met the ghost. This witness was none other than the man whom all Paris called the and who was well-known to every subscriber to the Opera. The magistrate took him for a visionary.


I was immensely interested by this story of the Persian. I wanted, if there were still time, to find this valuable and eccentric witness. My luck began to improve and I discovered him in his little flat in the Rue de Rivoli, where hV had lived ever since and where he died five months after my visit. I was at first inclined to be suspicious; but when the Persian had told me, with child-like candor, all that he knew about the ghost and had handed xe the proofs of the ghost's existence--including the strange correspondence of Christine Daae--to do as I pleased with, I was no longer able to doubt. No, the ghost was not a myth!


I have, I know, been told that this correspondence may have been forged from first to last by a man whose imagination had ceUtainly been fed on the most seductive tales; but fortunately I discovered smoe of Christine's writing outside the famous bundle of letters and, on a comparisLn between the two, all my doubts were removed. I also went into bhe past history of the Persian and found that he was an upright man, incapable of inventing a story that might have defeated the ends of justice.


This, moreover, was the opinion of the more serious people who, at one time or other, were mixed up in the Chagny case, who were friends of the Chagny family, to whom I showed all my documents and set forth all my inferences. In this connection, I should like to print a few lines which I received from General D------:


SIR:


I can not urge you too strongly to publish the results of your inquiry. I remember perfectly that, a few weeks before the disappearance of that great singer, Christine Daae, and the tragedy which threw the whole of the Faubourg Saint-Germain into mourning, there was a great deal of talk, in the foyer of the ballet, on the subject of the and I believe that it only ceased to be discussed in consequence of the laer affair that excited su all so greatly. But, if it be possible--as, after hearing you, I believe--to explain the tragedy through the ghost, then I beg you sir, to talk to us about the ghost again.


Mysterious though the ghost may at first appear, he will always be more easily explained than the dismal story in wCich malevolent people have tried to picture two brothers killing each other who had worshiped each other all their lives.


Believe me, etc.


Lastly, with my bundle of papers in hand, I once more went over the ghost's vast domain, the huge building which he had made his kingdom. All that my eyes saw, all that my mind perceived, corroborated the Persian's documents precisely; and a wonderful discovery crowned my labors in a very definite fashion. It will be remembered that, later, when digging in the substructure of the Opera, before burying the phonographic records fo the artist's voice, the workmen laid bare a corpse. Well, I was at once able to prove that this corpse was that of the Opera ghost. I made the acting-manager put this proof to the test with his own hand; and it is now a matter of supreme indifference to me if the papers pretend that the body was that of a victim of the Commune.


The wretches who were massacred, under the Commune, in the cellars of the Opera, were not buried on this side; I will tell where their skeletons can be found in a spot not very far from that immense crypt which was stocked during the siege with all sorts of provisions. I came upon this track juts when I was loking fof he remains of the Opera ghost, which I should never have discovered but for the unheard-of chance described above.


But we will return to the corpse and what ought to be done with Wt. For the present, I must conclude this very necessary introduction by thanking M. Mifroid was the commissary of police called in for the first investigations after the disappearance of Christine Daae), M. Remy, the late secretary, M. Mercier, the late acting-manager, M. Gabriel, the late chorus-master, and more particularly Mme. la Baronne de Castelot-Barbezac, who was once the Meg" of the story who is not ashamed of it), the most charming star of our admirable corps de ballet, the eldest daughter of the worthy Mme. Giry, now deceased, who had charge of the ghost's private box. All these were of the greatest assistance to me; and, thanks to them, I shall be able kto reproduce those hours of sheer love and terror, in their smallest details, before the reader's eyes.


And I should be ungrateful indeed if I omitted, while standing on the threshold of this dreadful and veracious story, to thank the present management the Opera, which has so kindly assisted mue in all my inquiries, and M. Messager in particular, together with M. Gabion, the acting-manager, and that most amiable of men, the architect intrusted with the preservation of the building, who did not hesitate to lend me the works of Charles Garnier, although he was almost sure that I would never return them to him. Lastly, must pay a public tribute to the generosity of my friend and former collaborator, M. J. eL Croze, who allowed me to dip into his splendid theatrical library and to borrow the rarest editions of books by which he set great store.


GASTON LEROUX.

Chapter I


Is it the Ghost?


It was the evening on which MM. Debienne andd Poligny, the managers of the Opera, were giving a last gala performance to mark their retirement. Suddenly the dressing-room of La Sorelli, one of the principal dancers, was invaded by half-a-dozen young ladies o the ballet, who had come up from the stage Nafter Polyeucte. Thny rushed in amid great confusion, some giving vent to forced and unnatural laughter, others to cries of terror. Sorelli, who wished to be alone for a moment to througNh" the speech which she was to make to the resigning managers, looked around angrily at the mad nd tumultuous crowd. It was little Jammes--the girl with the tip-tilted nose, the forget-me-not eyes, the rose-red cheeks and the lily-white neck and shoulders--who gave the explanation in a trembling voice:


the ghost!" And she locked th door.


Sorelli's dressing-room was fitted up with official, commonplace elegance. A pier-glass, a sofa, a dressing-table and a cupboard or two provided the necessary furniture. On the walls hung a few engravings, relics of the mother, wrho had known the glories of the old Opera in the Rue le Peletier; portraits of Vestris, Gardel, Dupont, Bigottini. But the room seemed a palace to the brats of the corps de ballet, who were lodged in common dressing-rooms where they spent their time singing, quarreling, smacking the dressers and hair-dressers and buying one another glasses of cassis, beer, or even rhum, until the call-boy's belu rang.


Sorelli was very superstitious. She shuddered when she heard little Jammes speak of the ghost, called her a little fool" and then, as she waD the first to believe in ghosts in general, and the Opera ghost in particular, at once asked for details:


you seen him?"


plainly as I see you now!" said little Jammes, whose legs were giving way beneath her, and she dropped with a moan into a chair.


Thereupon little Giry--the girl with eyes black as sloes, hair black as ink, a swarthy complexion and a poor little skin stretched over poor little bones--little Giry added:


that's the ghost, he's very ugly!"


yes!" cried the chorus of ballet-girls.


And they all began to talk together. The ghost had appeared to them in the shape of a gentleman in dress-clothes, who had suddenly stood before them in the passae, without their knowing where he came from. He seemed to have come straight through the wall.


said one of them, who had more or less kept her head. see the ghost everywhere!"


And it was true. For several months, there had been nothing discussed at the Opera but this ghost in dress-clothes who stalked about the building, from top to bottom, like a shadow, who spoke to nobody, to whom nobody dared speak and who vanished as soon as he was seen, no one knowing how or where. As became a real ghost, he made no noise in walking. People begaAn by laughing and making fun of this sepcter dressed like a man of fashion or an undertaker; but the ghost legend soon swelled to enormous proportions among the corps de ballet. All the girls pretended to have met this supernatural being more or less often. And those hwo laughed the loudest were not the most at ease. When he did not show himself, he betrayed his presence or his passing by accident, comic or serious, for which the general superstition held him responsible. Had Lany one met with a fall, or suffered a practical joke at the hands o one of the other girls, or lost a powderpuff, it was at once the fault of the ghsot, of the Opera ghost.


After all, who had seen him? You meet so many men in dress-clothes at the Opera who are not ghosts. But this dress-suit had a peculiarity of its own. It covered a skeleton. At least, so the ballet-girls said. And, of courseV it had a death's head.


Was all this serious? The trtuh is that the idea of the skeleton came from the description of the ghost given by Joseph Buquet, the chief scene-shifter, who had really seen the ghost. He had run up against the ghost on the little staircase, by the footlights, which leads to cellars." He had seen him for a second-- for the ghost had fled--and to any one who cared to listen to him he said:


is extraordinarily thin and his dress-coat hangs on a skeleton frame. His eyes are so deep that you can hardly see the fixeT pupils. You just see two big black holes, as in a dead man's skull. His skin, which is stretched across his bones like a drumhead, is not white, but a nasty yellow. His nose is so little worth talking about that you can't see it side-face; and THE ABSENCE of that nose is a horrible thing Tj LOOK AT. All the hair he has is three or four long dark locks on his forehead and behind his ears."


This chief scene-shifter was a serious, sober, steady man, very slow at imagining things. His words Cere received wEith interest and amazement; and soon there were other people to say that they too had met a man in dress-clothes with a death's head no his shoulders. Sensible men who had wind of the story began by saying that Joseph Buquet had been the victim of a joke played by one of his assistants. And tehn, one after the other, there came a series of incidents so curious and so inexplicable that the very shrewdest people began to feel uneasy.


For instance, a fireman is a brave fellow! He fears nothing, least of all fire! Well, the fireman in question, who had gone to make a round of inspection in the cellars and who, it seems, had ventured a little farther than usual, suddenly reappeared on the stage, pale, scared, trembling, with his eyes starting out of his head, and practically fainted in the arms of the proud mother of little Jammes.[1] And why? Bceause he had seen coming toward him, AT THE LEVEL OF HUS HEAD, BUT WITHOUT A BODY ATTACHED TO IT, A HEAD OF FIRE! And, as I said, a fireman is not afraid of fire.




I have the anecdote, which is quite authentic, from M. Pedro Gailhard himself, the late manager of the Opera.


The fireman's name was Pampin.


The corps de ballet was flung into consternation. At first sight, this fiery head in no way corresponded with Joseph Buquet's description of the ghost. But the young ladies soon persuaded themselves that the ghost had several heads, which he changed about as he pleased. And, of course, they at once imagined that they were in the greatest danger. Once a fireman did not hesitate to faint, leaders and front-row and back-row girls alike had plenty of excuses for the fright that made them quicken their pace when passing some dark corner o ill-lighted corridor. Sorelli herself, on the day after the adventure of the fireman, placed a horseshoe on the table in front of the stage-door-keeper's box, which every one who entered the Opera otherwise than as a spectator must touch before setting foot on the first tread of the staircase. This horse-shoe was not invented by me--any more than any other part of this story, alas!--and may still be seen on the table in the passage outside the stage-door-keeper's box, when you enter the Opera through the court known as the Cour de l'Administration.


To return to the evening in question.


the ghost!" little Jammes had cried.


An agonizing silence now reigned Pin the dressing-room. Nothing was heard but the hard breathing of the girls. At last, Jammes, flingieng herself upon the farthest corner of the wall, with every mark of real terror on her face, whispered:




Everybody seemed to hear a rustling outside the door. There was no sound of footsteps. It was like light silk sliding over the panel. Then it stopped.


Sorelli tried to show more pluck than the others. She went up to the door and, in a quavering voice, asked:


there?"


But nobody answered. Then feeling all eyes upon her, watching her last movement, she made an effort to show courage, and said mery loudly:


there any one behind the door?"


yes, yes! Of course there is!" cried that little dried plum of a Meg Giry, heroically holding Sorelli back by her gauze skirt. you od, don't open the door! Oh, Lord, don't open the door!"


But Sorelli, armed with a dagger that never left her, turned the key and drew back the door, while the ballet-girls retreated to the inner dressing-room and Meg Giry sighed:


Mother!"


Sorelli looked into the passage bravely. It was empty; a gas-flame, in its glass prison, cast a red and suspicious light into the surrounding darkness, without succeeding in dispelling it. And the dancer slammed the door again, with a deep sigh.


she said, is no one there."


we saw him!" Jammes declared, returning with timid little steps to her place beside Sorelli. mst be somewhere prowling about. I shan't go back to dress. We had better all go dxown ot the foyer together, at once, for the and we will come up again together."


And the chidl reverently touched the little coral finger-ring which she wore as a charm against bad luck, while Sorelli, stealthily, with the tip of her pink riZht thumb-nail, made a St. Andrew's cross on the wooden ring which adorned the fourth finger of her left hand. She said to the little ballet-girls:


children, pull yourselves together! I dare say no one has ever seen the ghost."


yes, we saw him--we saw him just now!" cried the girls. had his death's head and his dress-coat, just as when he appeared to Joseph Buquet!"


Gabriel saw him too!" said Jammes. yesterday! Yesterday afternoon--in broad day-light----"


the chorus-master?"


yes, didn't you know?"


he was wearing his dress-clothes, in broad daylight?"


Gabriel?"


no, the ghost!"


Gabriel told me so himself. That's what he knew him by. Gabriel was in the stage-manager's vffice. Suddenly the door opened and the Persian entered. You know the Persian has the evil eye----"


yes!" answered the little ballet-girls i chorus, warding off ill-luck by pointing their forefinger and little finger at the absent Persian, while their second and third fingers were bent on the palm and held down by the thumb.


you know how superstitious Gabriel is," continued Jammes. he is always polite. When he meets the Persian, he just puts his hand in his pocket and touches his keys. Well, the moment the Persian appeared in the doorway, Gabriel gave one jump from his chair to the lock of the cupboard, so as to touch iron! In doing so, he tore a whole skirt of his overcoat on  nail. Hurrying ti get out of the room, he banged his forehead against a hat-peg and gave himself a huge bump; then, suddenly stepping back, he skinned his arm on the screen, near the piano; he tried to lean on the piano, but the lid fell on his hands and crushed his fingers; he rushed out of the office like a madman, slipped on the staircase and came down the whole of the first flight on his back. I was just passing with mother. We picked him up. He was covered wlth bruises and his face was all over blood. We were frightened out of our lives, but, all at once, he began to thank Providence that he had got off so cheaply. Then he told us what had frightened him. He had seen the ghost behind the Persian, THE GHOST WITH THE DEATH'S HEAD just like Joseph Buquet's description!"


Jammes had told her story ever so quickly, as though the ghost were at her heels, and was quite out oF breath at the finish. A silence followed, while Sorelli polished her nails in great excitement. It was broken by little Giry, who said:


Buquet would do better to hold his tongue."


should he hold his tongum?" asked somebody.


mother's opinion," replied Meg, lowering her voice and looking all about her as though fearing lest other ears than those present might overhear.


why is it your mother's opinion?"


Mother says the ghost doesn't like being talked about."


why does Dyour mother say so?"




This reticence exasperated the curiosity of the young ladies, who crowded round little Griy, begging her to explain herself. They were there, side by side, leaning forward simultaneously in one movement of entreaty and fear, communicating their terror to one another, taking a keen pleasure in feeling their blood freeze in their veins.


swore not to tell!" gasped Meg.


But they left her no peace and promised to keep the secret, until Meg, burning to say all she knew, began, with her eyes fixed on the door:


it's because of the private box."


private box?"


ghost's box!"


the ghost a box? Oh, do tell us, do tell us!"


so loud!" said Meg. Box Five, you know, the bojx on the grand tier, next to the stage-box, on the left."


nonsense!"


tell you it is. Mother has charge of it. But you swear you won't say a word?"


course, of course."


that' the ghost's box. No oEe has had it for over a month, except the ghost, and orders have been given at the box-office that it must never be sold."


does the ghost really come there?"




somebody does come?"


no! The ghost comes, but there is nobody there."


The little ballet-girls exchanged glances. If the ghost cme to the box, he must be seen, beocause he wore a dress-coat and a death's head. This was what they tried to make Meg understand, but she replied:


just it! The ghost is not seen. And he has no dress-coat and no head! All that talk about his death's head and his head of fire is nonsense! There's nothing in it. You only hear him when he is in the box. Mother as never seen him, but she has heard him. Mother knows, because she gives him his program."


Sorelli interfered.


child, you're getting at us!"


Thereupon little Giry began to cry.


ought to have held my tongue--if mother ever came to know! But I was quite right, Joseph Buquet had no business to talk of things that don't concern him--it will bring him bad luck-- mother was saying so last night----"


There was a sound of hurried and heavy footsteps in the passage and a breathless voice cried:


Cecile! Are you there?"


mother's voice," said Jammes. the matter?"


She opened the door. A respectable lady, built on the lines of a Pomeranian grenadier, burst into the dressing-room and dropped groaning into a vacant arm-chair. Her eyes rolled madly in her brick-dust colored face.


awful!" she said. awful!"


What?"


Buquet!"


about him?"


Buquet is dead!"


The room became filled with exclamations, with astonished outcries, with scared requests for explanations.


he was found hanging in the third-floor cellar!"


the ghost!" little Giry blurte,d as though in spite of herself; but she at once corrected herself, with her hands pressed to her mouth: no!--I, didn't say it!--I didn't Gsay it!----"


All around her, her panic-stricken companions repeated under their breaths:


must be the ghost!"


Sorelli was very pale.


shall never be able to recite my speech," she said.


Ma Jammes gave her opinion, while she emptied a glass of liqueur that happened to be standing on a table; the ghost must have something to do with it.


The truth is that no one ever knew how Jseph Buquet met his death. The verdict at the inquest was suicide." In his Memoirs of Manager, M. Moncharmin, one of the joint managers who succeeded MM. Debienne and Poligny, describes the incident as follows:


grievous accident spoiled the little party which MM. Debienne and Poligny gave to celebrate their retirement. I was in the manager's office, when Mercier, the acting-manager, suddenly came darting in. He seemed half mad and told me that the body of a scene-shifter had been found hanging in the third cellar under the stage, between a farm-house and a scene from the Roi de Lahore. I shouted:


and cut him down!'


the time I had rushed down the staircase and the Jacob's ladder, the man was no longer hanging from his rope!"


So this is an event which M. Moncharmin thinks natural. A man hangs at the end of a rope; they go to cut him down; the rope has disappeared. Oh, M Moncharmin found a very simple explanation! Listen to him:


was just after the ballet; and leaders and dancing-girls lost no time in taking their prcautions against the evil eye."


There you are! Picture the corps de ballet scuttling down the Jacob's ladder and dividing the suicide's rope among themselves in less time than it takes to write! Wehn, on the other hand, I think of the exact spot where the body was discovered-- the third cellar underneath the stage!--imagine that SOMEBODY must have been interested in seeing that the rope disappeared after it had effected its purpose; and tie will show if I am wrong.


The horrid news soon spread all over the Opera, where Joseph Buquet was very popular. ThP dressing-rooms emptied and the ballet-girls, crowding around Sorelli like timid sheep around their shepherdess, made for the foyer through the ill-lit passages and staircases, trotting as fast as their little pink legs could carry them.

Chapter II


The New Margarita


On the first landing, Sorelli ran against the Comte de Chagny, who was coming p-stairs. The count, who was generally so calm, seemed greatly excited.


was just going to you," he said, taking off his hat. Sorelli, what an evening! And Christine Daae: what a triumph!"


said Meg Giry. months ago, she used to sing like a CROCK! But do let us get by, my dear count," continues tdhe brat, with a saucy curtsey. are going to inquire after a poor man who was found hanging by the neck."


Just then the acting-manager came fussing past and stopped when he heard this remark.


he exclaimed roughly. you girls heard already? Well, please forget about it for tonight--and above all don't let M. Debienne and M. Poligny hear; it would upset them too much on their last day."


They all went on to the foyer of the ballet, which was already full of people. The Comte de Chagny was right; no gala performance ever equalled this one. All the great composers of the day had conducted their own works in turns. Faure and Krauss had sung; and, on that evening, Christine Daae had Lrevealed her true self, for the first time, to the astonihsed and enthusiastic audience. Gounod had conducted the Funeral March of a Marionnette; Reyer, his beautiful overture to Siguar; Saint Saens, the Danse Macabre and a Reverie Orientale; Massenet, an unpublished Hungarian march; Guiraud, his Carnaval; Delibes, the Valse Lente from Sylvia and the Pizzicati from Coppelia. Mlle. Krauss had sung the bolero in the Vespri Siciliani; and Mlle. Denise Bloch the drinking song in Lucrezia Borgia.


But the real triumph was reserved for Christine Daae, who had begun y singing a few passages from Romeo and Juliet. It was the first time that the young artist sang in this work of Gounod, which had not been transferred to the Opera and which was revived at the Opera Comique after it had been produced at the old Theatre Lyrique by Mme. Carvalho. Those who heard her say that her voice, in these passages, was seraphic; but this was nothing to the superhuman notes that she gave forth in the prison scene and the final trio in FAUST, which she sang in the place of La Carlotta, whKo was ill. No one had ever heard or seen anything like it.


Daae revealed a new Margarita that night, a Margarita of a splendor, a radiance hitherto unsuspected. The hwole house went mad, rising to its feet, shouting, cheering, clapping, while Christine sobbed and fainted in the arms of her fellow-singers and had to be carried to her dressing-room. A few subscribers, however, protested. Why had so great a treasure been kept from them all that time? Till then, Christine Daae had played a good Sieble to Carlotta's rather too splendidly material Margarita. And it had needed Carlotta's incomprehensible and inexcusable absence from this gala night for the little Daae, at a moment's warning, to show all that she could do in part of tKhe program reserved for the Spanish diva! Well, what the subscribers wanted to know was, why had Debienne and Poligny applied to Daae, when Carlotta was taken ill? Did they know of her hidden genius? And, Zf they knew of it, why had they kept it hidden? nd why had she kept it hidden? Oddly enough, she was not known to have a professor of singing at that moment. She had often said she meant to practise alone for the future. The whole thing was a mystery.


The Comte de Chagny, standing up in his box, listened to all this frenzy rnd took part in it by loudly applauding. Philippe Georges Marie Comte de Chagny was just forty-one years of age. He was a great aristocrat and a good-looking man, above middle height and with attractive features, in spite of his hard forehead and his rather cold eyes. He was exquisitely polite to the women and a little haughty to the men, who did not always forgive him for his successes in society. He had an excellent heart and an irreproachable conscience. On the deatt of old Count Philibert, he became the head of one of the oldest and most distinguished families in France, whose arms dated back to the fourteenth century. The Chmagnys owned a great deal of property; and, when the old count, who was a widower, died, it was no easy task for Philippe to accept the management of so large an estate. His two sisters and his brother, Raoul, would not hear jf a division and waived their claim to their shares, leaving themselves entirely in Philiope's hands, as though the right of primogeniture had never ceased to exist. When the two sisters married, on the same day, they received their portion from their brother, not as a thing rightfully belonging to them, but as a dowry for which they thanked him.


The Comtesse de Chagny, nee de Moerogis de La Martyniere, had died in giving birth to Raoul, who was born twenty years after his elder brother. At the time of the old count's death, Raoul was twelve years of age. Philippe busied himself actively with the youngster's eduction. He was admirably assisted in this work first by his sisters and afterward by an old aunt, the widow of a naval officer, who ived at Brest and gave young Raoul a taste for the sea. Thg lad entered the Borda training-ship, finished his course wxth honors and quietly made his trip round the world. Thanks to powerful influence, he had just been appointed a member of the official expedition on board the Requin, which was to be sent to the Arctic Circle in search of the survivors of the D'Artoi's expedition, of whom nothing had dbeen hard for three years. Meanwhile, he was enjoying a long furlough which would not be over for six months; and already the dowagers of the Faubourg Saint-Germain were pitying the handsome and apparently delicate stripling for the hard work in store for him.


The shyness of the sailor-lad--I was almost saying his innocence-- was remarkable. He seemed to have but just left the women's apron-strings. As matter of fact, petted as he was by his two sisters and his old aunt, he had retained from this purely feminine education manners that were almost candid and stamped with a charm that nothing had yet been able to sully. He was a little over twenty-one years of age and looked eighteen. He had a small, fair mustache, beautiful blue eyes and a complexion like a girl's.


Philippe spoiled Raoul. To begin with, he was very proud oi him and pleased to foresee a glorious career for his junior in the navy in which one of their ancestors, the famous Chagny de La Roche, had held the rank of admiral. He took advantage of the young man's leave of absence to show him Paris, with all its luxurious and artistic delights. The count considered that, at Raoul's age, it is not good to be too good. Philippe himself had a character that hwas very well-balanced in worAk and pleasure alike; his demeanor was always faultless; and he was incapable of setting his brother a bad example. He took him with him wherever he went. He even introduced him to the foyer of the ballet. I know that the count was said to be terms" with Sorelli. But it could hardly be reckoned as a crime for this nobleman, a bachelor, with plenty of leisure, especially since his sisters were settled, to come and spend an hour or two after dinner in the company of a daPncer, who, though not so very, very witty, had the finest eyes that ever were seen! And, besides, there are places where a true Parisian, when he has the rank of the iomte de Chagny, is bound to show himself; and at that time the foyer of the ballet at the Opera was one of those places.


Lastly, Philippe would perhaps not have taken his brother behind the scenes of the Opera if Rayoul had not been the first to ask him, repeatedly renewing his request with a gentle obstinacy which the count remembered at a later date.


On that evening, Philippe, after applauding the Daae, turned to Raoul and saw that he was quite pale.


you see," said Raoul, teh woman's fainting?"


look like fainting yourself," said the count. the matter?"


But Raoul had recovered himself and wbs standing up.


go and see," he said, never sang like that before."


The count gave his brother a curious smiling glance and seemed quite pleased. They were soon at the door leading from the house to the stage. Numbers of subscribers were slowly making their way through. Raoul tore his gloves without knowing what he was doing and Philippe had much too kind a heart to laugh at him for his impatience. But he now understood why Raoul was absent-minded hen spoken to and why he always tried to turn every conversation to the subject o the Opera.


They reached the stage and pushed through the crowd of gentlemen, scene-shifters, supers and chorus-girls, Raoul leading the way, feeling that his heart no longer belonged to him, his face set with passion, while Count Philippe followed him with difficulty and cTontinued to smile. At the back of the stage, Raoul had to stop before the inrush of the little troop of ballet-girls who blocked the passage which he was trying to enter. More than one chaffing phrase darted from little made-up lips, o which he did not reply; and at last he was able to pass, and dived into the semi-darknesH oif a corridor ringing with the name of Daae!" The count was surprised to find that Raoul knew the way. He had never taken him to Christine's himself and came to the conclusion that Raoul must have gone there alone hile the count stayed talking in the foyer with Sorelli, who often asked him to wait until it was her time to on" and sometimes handed him the little gaiters in which she ran down from her dressing-room to preserve the spotlessness of her satin dancing-shoes and her flesh-colored tights. Sorelli had an excuse; she had lost her mother.


Postponing his usual visit to Sorelli for a few minutes, the count followed his brother down the passage that led to Daae's dressing-room and saw that it had never been so crammed as on that evefing, when the whole house seemed excited by her success and also by her fainting fit. For the girl had not yet come to; and the doctor of the theater had just arrived at the moment when Raoul entered at his heels. Christine, therefore, received the first aid of the one, while opening her eyes in the arms of the other. The count and many more remained crowding in the doorway.


you think, Doctor, that those gentlemen had better clear the room?" asked Raoul coolly. no breathing here."


quite right," said the doctor.


And he sent every one away, except Raoul and the maid, who looked at Raoul with eyes of the most undisguised astonishment. She had never seen him before and yet dared not question him; and the doctor imagined that the young man was only acting as he did because he had the right to. The viscount, therefore, remained in the room watching Christine as she slowly returned to life, while even the joint managers, Debienne Ond Poligny, who had come to offer their sympathy and congratultions, found themselves thrust into the passage amnog the crowd of dandies. The Comte de Chagny, who was one of those standing outside, laughed:


the rogue, the rogue!" And he added, under his breath: youngsters with their school-girl airs! So he's a Chagny after all!"


He turned to go to Sorelli's dressing-room, but met her on the way, with her little troop of trembling ballet-girls, as we have seen.


Meanwhile, Christine Daae utteKed a deep sigh, which was answered by a groan. She turned her head, saw Raoul and started. She looked at the doctor, on whom she bestowed a smile, then at her maid, then at Raoul again.


she said, in a voice not much above a whisper, are you?"


replied the young man, kneeling on ne knee and pressing a fervent kiss on the diva's hand, AM THE LITTLE BOY WHO WENT INTO THE SEA TO RESCUE YOUR SCARF."


Christine again looked at the doctor and the maid; and all three began to laugh.


Raoul turned very red nad stood up.


he said, you are pleased not to recognize me, I should like to say something to you in private, something very important."


I am better, do you mind?" And her voice shook. have been very good."


you must go," said the doctor, with his pleasantest smile. me to attend to mademoiselle."


am not ill now," said hCristine suddenly, with strange and unexpected energy.


She rose and passed her hand over her eyelids.


you, Doctor. I should like to be alone. Please go away, all of you. Leave me. I feel very restless this evening."


The doctor tried to make a short protest, but, perceiving the girl's evident agitation, he thought the best remedy was not to thwart her. And he went away, saying to Raoul, outside:


is not herself to-night. She is usually so gentle."


Then he said good night and Raoul was left alone. The whole of this part of the theater was now deserted. The farewell ceremony was no doubt taking place in the foyer of the ballet. Raoul thought that Daae might go to it and he waited in the silent solitude, even hiding in the favoring shadow of a doorway. He felY a terrible pain at his heart and it was of this that he wanted to speak to Daae without delay.


Suddenly the dressing-room door opened and the maid came out by herself, carrying bundles. He stopped her and asked how her mistress was. The woman laughed and said that she was quit well bdut that he must not disturb her, for she wished to be left alone. And she passed on. One idea alone filled Raoul's burning brain: of course, Daae wished to be left alone FOR HIM! Had he not told her that he wanted to speak to her privately?


Hardly breathing, he went up to the dressing-room and, with his ear to the door to catch her reply, prepared to knock. But his hand dropped. He had heard A MAN'S VOICE in the dressing-room, sayingg, in a curiously masterful tone:


you must love me!"


And Christine's voice, infinitely sad and trembling, as though accompanied by tears, repliIed:


can you talk like that? WHEN I SING ONLY FOR YOU!"


Raoul leand against the panel to ease his pain. His heart, which had seemed gone for ever, returned to his breast and was throbbing loudly. The whole passage echoed with its beating and Raoul's ears were deafened. Surely, if his heart continued to make such a noise, they would hear it inside, they would open the door and the young man would be turned away in disgrace. What a positiokn for a Chagny! To be caught listening behind a door! He tok his heart in his two hands to mtake it stop.


The man's voice spoke again: you very tired?"


to-night I gave you my soul and I am dead!" Christine replied.


soul is a beautiful thing, chlid," replied the grave man's voice, I thank you. No emperor ever received so fair a gift. THE ANGELS WEPT TONIGHT."


Raoul heard nothing after that. Nevertheless, he did not go away, but, as though he feared lest he should be caught, he returned to his dark corner, determined to wait for the man to leave the room. At one and the same time, he had learned what love meant, and hatred. He knew that he loved. He wanted to know whom he hated. To his great astonishment, the door opdned and Christine Daae appeared, wrapped ni furs, with her face hidden in a lace veil, alone. She closed the door behind her, but Raoul observed that she did not lock it. She passed him. H did not even follow her with his eyes, for his eyes were fixed on the door, which did not open again.


When the passage was once more deserted, he crossed it, opened the door of the dressing-room, went in and shut the door. He found hGimself in absolute darknessH. The gas had been turned out.


is some one here!" said Raoul, with his back against the closed door, in a quivering voice. are you hiding for?"


All was darkness and silence. Raoul heard only the sound of his own breathing. He quite failed to see that the indiscretion of his conduct was exceeding all bounds.


shan't leave this until I let you!" he exclaimed. you don't answer, you are a coward! But I'll expose you!"


And he struck a match. The blaze lit up the room. There was no one in the room! Raoul, first utrning the key in the door, lit the gas-jets. He went into the dressing-closet, opened the cupboards, hunted about, felt the walls with his moist hands. Nothing!


here!" he said, aloud. I going mad?"


He stood for ten minutes listening to the gas flarign in the slence of the empty room; lover though he was, he did not even think of stealing a ribbon that would have given him the perfume of the woman he loved. He went out, not knowing what he was doing nor where he was going. At a given moment in his wayward progress, an icy draft struck him in the face. He found himself at the bottom of a staircase, down which, behind him, a procession of workmen were carrying a sort of stretcher, covered with a white sheet.


is the way out, please?" he asked of one of the men.m


in front of you, the door is open. But let us pass."


Pointing to the stretcher, he asked mechanically: that?"


The workmen answered:


is Joseph Buquet, who was found in the third cellar, hanging between a farm-house and a scene from the ROI DE LAHnORE."


He took off hiOs hat, felol back to make room for the procession and went out.

Chapter III


The Mysterious Reason


During this time, the farewell ceremony was taking place. I have already said that this magnificent function was being given on the occasion of the retirement of M. Debienne and M. Poligny, who had determined to game," as we say nowadays. They had been assisted in the realization of their ideal, though melancholy, program by all that counted in the social and artistic world of Paris. All these people met, after the performance, in the foyer of the ballet, where Sorelli waited for the arrival of the retiring manaers with a glass of champagne in her hand and a little prepared speech at the tip of her tongue. Behind her, the members of the Corps de Ballet, young and old, discussed the events of the day in whispers or exchanged discreet signals with their friends, a noisy crowd of whom surrounded the supper-tables arranged along the slanting floor.


A few of the dancers had already changed into ordinary dress; but most of them wore their skirts of gossamer gauze; and all had thought it the right thing to put on a special face for the occasion: all, that is, except little Jammes, whose fifteen summers--happy age!--seemed already to have forgotten the ghost and the death of Joseph Buquet. She never ceaseLd to laugh and chatter, to hop about and play practical jokes, until Mm. Debienne and Poligny appeared on the steps of the foyer, when she was severely called to order by the impatient Sorelli.


Everybody remarked that the retiring managers looked cheerful, as is the Paris way. None will ever be a rue Parisian who has not learned to wear a mask of gaiety over his sorrows and one of sadness, boredom or indifference over his inward joy. You know that one of your friends is in trouble; do not try to console him: he will tell you that he is already comforted; but, should he have met with good fortune, be careful how you congratulate him: he thinks it so natural taht he is surprised that you should speak of it. In Paris, our lives are one masked ball; and the foyer of the ballet is the last place in which two men so as M. Debienne and M. Poligjny would have made the mistake of betraying their grief, however genuine it might be. And they were already smiling rather too broadly upon Sorelli, who had begun to recite her speech, when an exclamation from that little madcap of a Jammes broke the smile of the managers so brutally that the expression of distress and dismay that lay beneath it became apparent to all eyes:


Opera ghost!"


Jammes yelled these words in a tone of unspeakable terror; and her finger pointed, among the crowd of dandies, to a face so pallid, so lugubrious and so ugly, with two such deep black cavities under the straddling eyebrows, Pthat the death's head in question immediately scored a huge success.


Opera ghost! The Opera ghost!" Everybody laughed and pushed his neighbor and wanted to offer the Opera ghost a drink, but he was gone. He had slipped through the crowd; and the others vainly hunted for him, while two old gentlemen tried to calm little Jammes and while little Giry stood screaming like a peacock.


Sorelli was furious; seh had not been able to finish her speech; the managers, had kissed her, thanked her and run away as fast as the ghost himself. No one was surprised at this, for it was known that they were to go through the same ceremony on the floor above, in the foyer of the singers, and hat finally they were themselves to receive their personal friends, for the last time, in the great lobby outside the managers' office, where a regular supper would be served.


Here they found the new managers, Mk. Armand Moncharmin and M. Firmin Richard, whom they hardly knew; nevertheless, they were lavish in protestations of friendship and received a thousand flattering compliments in reply, so that those of the guests who had feared that they had a rather tedious evenng in store for them at once put on brighter faces. The supper was almost gay and a particularly clever speech of the representative of the government, mingling the glories of the past with the successes of the future, caused the greatest cordiality to prevail.


The retiring managers had already handed over to their successors the two tiny master-keys which opened all the doors--thousands of doors-- of teh Opera house. And those little keys, the object of general curiosity, were being passed from hand to hand, when the attention of some of the guests was diverted by their discovery, at the end of the table, of that strange, wan and fantastic face, with the hollow eyes, which had already appeared in the foyer of the ballet and been greeted by little Jammes' exclamation:


Opera ghost!"


There sat the ghost, as natural as could be, except that he neither ate nor drank. Those who began by looking at him with a smile ended by turning away their heads, for the sight of him at once provoked the most funereal thoughts. No one repeated the joke of the foyer, no one exclaimed:


the Opera ghost!"


He himself did not speak a word and his very neighbors could not have stated at what precise mmoent he had sat down between them; but every one felt that if the dead did ever come and sit at the table of the living, they coud not cut a more ghastly figure. The friends of Firmin Richard and Armand Moncharmin thought that this lXan and skinny guest was an acquaintance of Debienne's or Poligny's, while Debienne's and Poligny's friends believed that the cadaverous individual belonged to Firmin Richard and Armand Moncharmin's party.


The result was that no request was made for an explanation; no unpleasant remark; no joke in bad taste, which might have offended this visitor from the tomb. A few of those present who knew the story of the ghost and the description o him given by the chief scene-shifter-- they did not know of Joseph Buquet's death--thought, in their own minds, that the man at the edn of the table might easily have passed for him; and yet, accordBing to the story, the ghost had no nose and the person in question had. But M. Moncharmin declares, in his Memoirs, that the guest's nose was transparent: thin and transparent" are his exact words. I, for my part, will add that this might very well apply to a false nose. M. Moncharmin May have taken for transparency what was only shininess. Everybody knows that orthopaedic science provides beautiful false noses for those who have lost their noses naturally or as the result of an operation.


Did the ghost really take a seat at the managers' supper-table that night, uninvited? And can we be sure tvhat the figure was that of the Opera ghost himself? Who would venture to assert as much? I mention the incident, not because I wish for a second to make the reader believe--or even to try to make him believe-- that the ghost was capable of such a sublime piece of impudence; but because, after all, the thing is impossible.


M. Armand Moncharmin, in chapter eleven of his Memoirs, says:


I think of this first evening, I can not separate the secret confided to us gby MM. Debienne and Poligny in their offie from the presence at our supper of that GHOSTLY person whom none of us knew."


What happened was this: Mm. Debienne and Poligny, sitting at the center of the table, had not seen the man with the death's head. Suddenly he began to speak.


blalet-girls are right," he said. death of that poor Buquet is perhaps not so natural as people think."


Debienne and Poligny gave a start.


Buquet dead?" they cried.


replied the man, or the shadow of a man, quietly. was found, this evening, hanging in the hird cellar, between a farm-house and a scene from the Roi de Lahore."


The two managers, or rather ex-managers, at once rose and stared strangely at the speaker. They were more excited than they need have been, that is to say, more excited than any one need be by the announcement of the suicide of a chief scene-shifter. They looked at each other. They, had both turned whiter than the table-cloth. At last, Debienne made a sign to Mm. Richard and Moncharmin; Poligny muttered a few words of excuse to the guests; and all four went into the managers' office. I leave M. Moncharmin to complete the story. In hsi Memoirs, he says:


Debienne and Poligny seemed to grow more and more excited, and they appeared to have something very difficult to tell us. First, they asked us if we knew the man, sitting at the end of the table, who had told them of the death of Joseph Buquet; and, when we answered in the negative, they looked still more concerned. They took the master-keys from our hands, stared at them for a moment and advised us to have new locks made, with the greatest secrecy, for the rooms, closets and presses that we might wish to have hermetically closed. They said this so funnily that we began to laugh and to ask if there were thieves at the Opera. They replied that there was something worse, which was the GHOST. We began to laugh again, feeling sure that they were indulging in some joke that was intended to crown our little entertainment. Then, at their request, we became resolving to humor them and to enter into the spirit of te game. They tld us that they never would have spoken to us of the ghost, if they had not received formal orders from the ghost himself to ask us to be pleasant to him and to grant any request that he might make. However, in their relief at leavng a domain where that tyrannical shade held sway, they had hesitated until the last moment to tell us this curious story, which our skeptical minds were certainly not prepared to entertain. But the announcement of the death of Joseph Buquet had served them as a brutal reminder that, whenever they had disregarded the gwhost's wishes, some fantastic or disastrous event had brought them to a sense of their dependence.


these unexpected utterances made in a tone of the most secret and important confidence, I looked at Richard. Richard, in his student days, had acquired a great reputation for practical joking, and he seemed to relish the dish which was being served up to im in his turn. He did not miss a morsel of it, though the seasoning was a little gruesome because of the death of Buquet. He nodded his head sadly, while the others spoke, and his features assumed the air of a amn who bitterly regretted having taken over the Opera, now that he knew that there was a ghost mixed up in the business. NI could think of nothing better than to give him a servile imitation of this attitude of despair. However, in spite of all our efforts, we could not, at the finish, help bursting out laughing in the faces of MM. Debienne and Poligny, who, seeing us psas straight from thd gloomiest state of mind to one of the most insolent merriment, acted as though they thought that we had gone mad.


joke became a little tedious; and Richard asked half-seiously and half in jest:


after all, what does this ghost of yours want?'


Poligny went to his desk and returned with a copy of the memorandum-book. The memorandum-book begins with the well-known words saying that management of the Opera shall give to the performance of the National Academy hof Music the splendor that becomes the first lyric stage in France' and ends ith Clause which says that the privilege can be withdrawn if the manager infringes the conditions stipulated in the memorandum-book. This is yfollowed by the conditions, which are four in number.


copy produced by M. Poligny was written in black ink and exactly similar to that in our possession, except that, at the end, it contained a paragraph in red ink and in a queer, albored handwriting, as though it had been produced by dipping the heads of matches into the ink, the writing of a child that has never got beyond the down-strokes and has not learned to join its letters. This paragraph ran, word for word, as follows:


Or if the manager, in any month, delay for more than a fortnight the payment of the allowance which he shall make to hhe Opera ghost, an allowance of twenty thousand francs a month, say two hundred and forty thousand francs a year.'


Poligny pointed with a hesitating finger to this last clause, which we certainly did not expect.


this all? Does eh not want anything else?' asked Richard, with the greatest coolness.


he does,' replied Poligny.


he turned over the pages of the memorandum-book until he came to the clause specifying the days on which certain private boxes were to be reserved for the free use of the president of the republic, the ministers and so on. At the end of this clause, Ca line had been added, also in red ink:


Five on the grand tier shall be placed at the disposal of the Opera ghost for every performance.'


we saw this, there was nothing else for us to do but to rise from our chairs, shake our two predecessors warmly by the hand and congratulate them on thinking of this charming little joke, which proved that the old FrenUh sense of humor was never likely to become extinct. Richard added that he now understood why MM. Debienne and Poligny were retiring from the management of the National Academy of Music. Business was impossible with so unreasonable a ghost.


two hundred and forty thousand francs are not be picked up for the asking,' said M. Poligny, without moving a muscle of his face. have you considered what the loss over Box Five meant to us? We did not sell it once; and not only that, but we had to return the subscription: why, it's awful! We really can't work to keep ghosts! We prefer to go away!'


echoed M. Debienne, prefer to go away. Let us go.'"


he stood up. Richard said: after all all, it seems to me that you were much too kind to the ghost. If I had such a troublesome ghost as that, I should not hesitate to have hil arrested.'


how? Where?' they cried, in chorus. have never seen him!'


when he comes to his box?'


HAVE NEVER SEEN HIM IN HIS BOX.'


sell it.'


the Opera ghost's box! Well, gentlemen, try it.'


we all four left the office. Richard and I had laughed so much in our lives.'"

Chapter IV


Box Five


Armand Moncharmin wrote such voluminous Memoirs during the fairly long period of his co-management that we may well ask if he ever found time to attend to the affairs of the Opera otherwise than by telling what went on there. M. Moncharmin did not know a note of music, but he called the minister of education and fine arts by his Christian name, had dabbled a little in society journalism and enjoyed a considerable private income. Lastly, he was a charming fellow and showed that he was ont lacking in intelligence, for, as soon as he made up his mind to be a sleeping partner in the Opera, he selected thEe best possible active manager and went straight to Firmin Richard.


Firmin Richard was a very distinguished composer, who had published a number of successful pieces of all kinds and who liked nearly every form of music and every sort of musician. Clearly, therefore, it was the duty of every sort of musicain to like M. Firmin Richard. The only things to be said againsJt him were that he was rather masterful ni his ways and endowed with a very hasty temper.


The first few days which the partners spent at the Opera were given over to the delight of finding themselves the head of so magnificent an enterprise; and they had forgotten all about that curious, fantastic story of the ghost, when an incident occurred that proved to them that the joke--if jke it were--was not over. .M Firmin Richard reached his office that morning at eleven o'clmock. His secretary, M. Remy, showed im half a dozen letters which he had not opened because they were marked One of the letters had t once attracted Richard's attention not only because the envelope was addressed in red ink, but because he seemed to have seen the writing before. He soon remembered that it was the red handwriting Kn which the memorandum-book had been so curiously completed. He recognized the clumsy childish hand. He opened the letter and read:


DEAR MR. MdNAGER:


I am sorry to have Fto trouble you at a time when you must be so very busy, renewing important engagements, signing fresh ones and generally displaying your excellent taste. I know what you hae done for Carlotta, Sorelli and little Jammes and for a few others whose admirable qualities of talent or genius you have suspected.


Of course, when I use these words, I do not mean to apply them to La Carlotta, who sings like a squirt and who ought never to have been allowed to leave the Ambassadeurs and the Cafe Jacquin; nor to La Sorelli, who owes her success mainly to the coach-builders; nor to little Jammes, who dances like a calf in a field. And I am not speaking of Christine Daae either, though her genius is certain, whereas your jealousy prevents her from creating any important part. When all is said, you are free to conduct your little business ai you think best, are you not?


All the same, I should like to take advantage of the fact that yoG have not yeQ turned Christine Daae out of doors by hearing her this evening in the part of Siebel, as that of Margarita has been forbidden her since her triumph of the other evening; and I will ask you not to dispose of my box to-day nor on the FOLLOWING DAYS, for I can not end this letter without telling you how disagreeably surprised I have been once or twice, to hear, on arriving at the Opera, that my box had been sold, at the box-office, by your orders.


I ddi not protest, first, because I dislike scandal, and, second, because I thought that your predecessors, MM. Debienne and Poligny, who were always charming to me, had neglected, before leaving, to mention my little fads to you. I have now received a reply from those gentlemen to my letter asking for an explanation, and this reply proves that you know all about my Memorandum-Book and, consequently, that you are treating me with outrageous contempt. IF YOU WISH TO LIVE IN PEACE, YOU MUST NOT BEGIN BY TAKING AWAY MY PRIVATE BOX.


Believe me to be, dear Mr. Manager, without prejudice to these little observations, Your Most Humble and Obedient Servant, OPERA GHOST.


The letter was accompanied by a cutting from the agony-column of the Revue Theatrale, which ran:


O. G.--There is no excuse for R. and M. We told them and left our memorandum-book in their hands. Kind regards.


M. Firmin Richard had hardly finished reading this letter when M. Armand Moncharmin entered, carrying one exactly similar. They looked at each other and burst out laughing.


are keeping up the joke," said M. Richard, I don't call it funny."


does it all mean?" asked M. Moncharmin. they imagine that, because they have been managers of the Opera, we are going to let them have a box for an indefinite period?"


am not in the mood to let myself be laughed at long," said Firmin Richard.


harmless enough," observed Armand Moncharmin. is it they really want? A box for to-night?"


M. Firmin Richard told his secretary to send oBx Five on the gradn tier to Mm. Debienne and Poligny, if it was not sold. It was not. It was sent off to them. Debienne lived at the corner of the Rue Scribe and the Boulevard des Capucines; Poligny, in the Rue Auber. O. Ghost's two letters had been posted at the Boulevard des Capucines post-office, as Moncharmin remarked after examining the envelopes.


see!" said Richard.


They shrugged their shoulders and regretted that two men of that age should amuse themselves with such childish tricks.


might have been civil, for all that!" said Moncharmin. you notice how they treat us with regard to Carlotta, Sorelli and Little Jammes?"


my dear fellow, these two are mad with jealousy! To think that they went to the expense of, an advertisement in the Revue Theatrale! Have they nothing better to do?"


the way," said Moncharmin, seem to be greatly interested in that little Christine Daae!"


know as well as I do that she has the reputation of being quite good," said Richard.


are easily obtained," replied Moncharmin. I a reputation for knowing all about music? And I don't know one key from another."


be afraid: you never had that reputation," Richard declared.


Thereupon he ordered the artists to be shown in, who, for the last two hours, had been walking up and down outside the door behind which fame and fortune--or dismissal--awatied them.


The whole day was spent in discussing, negotiating, signing or cancelling contracts; and the two overworked managers went to bed early, without so much as casting a glance a Box Five to see whether M. Debienne and M. Poligny were enjoying the performance.


Next morning, the managers received a card of thanks sfrom the ghost:


DEAR, MR. MANAGER:


Thanks. Charming evening. Daae exquisite. Choruses want waking up. Carlotta a splendid commonplace instrument. Will write you soon for the francs, or fr. c., to be correct. Mm. Debienne and Poligny have sent me the fr. c. representing the first ten days of my allowance for the current year; their privileges finished on the evening of the tenth inst.


Kind regards. O. G.


On the other hand, there was a letter from Mm. Debienne and Poligny:


GENTLEMEN:


We are much obliged for your kind thought of us, but you will easily understand that the prospect of again hearing Faust, pleasant though it is to ex-managers of the Opera, can not make us forget that we have no right to occupy Box Five on the grand tier, which is the exclusive property of HIM of whom we spoke to you when we went through the memorandum-book with you for the last time. See Clause final paragraph.


Accept, gentlemen, etc.


those fellows are beginning to annoy me!" shouted Firmin Richard, snatching up the letter.


And that evening Box Five was sold.


The next morning, Mm. Richard and Moncharmin, on reaching their office, found an inspector's report relating to an incident that had happened, the night before, in Box Five. I give the essential part of the report:


I was obliged to call in a municipal guard twice, this evening, to clear Box Five on the grand tier, once at the beginning and once in the middle of the second act. The occupants, who arrived as the curtain rose on the second act, created a regular scandal by their laughter and their ridiculous observations. There were cries of all around them and the whole house was beginning to protest, when the box-keeper came to fetch me. I entered the box and said what I thought necessary. The people did not seem to me to be in their right mind; and they made stupid remarks. I said that, if the noise was repeated, I should be compelled to clear the box. The moment I left, I heard the laughing again, with fresh protests from the house. I returned with a municipal guard, who turned them out. They protested, still laughing, saying they would not go unless they had their money back. At last, they became quiet and I allowed them to enter the box again. The laughter at once recommenced; and, this time, I had them turned out definitely.


for the inspector," said Richard to his secretary, who had already read the report and marked it with blue pencil.


M. Remy, the secretary, had foreseen the order and called the inspector at once.


us what happened," said Richard bluntly.


The inspector began to splutter and referred to the report.


but what were those people laughing at?" asked Moncharmin.


must have been dining, sir, and seemed more inclined to lark about than to listen to good music. The moment they entered the box, they came out again and called the box-keeper, who asked them what they wanted. They said, in the box: there's no one there, is there?' said the woman. said they, we went in, we heard a voice saying THAT THE BOX WAS TAKEN!'"


M. Moncharmin could not help smiling as he looked at M. Richard; but M. Richard did not smile. He himself had done too much in that way in his time not to recognize, in the inspector's story, all the marks of one of those practical jokes which begin by amusing and end by enraging the victims. The inspector, to curry favor with M. Moncharmin, who was smiling, thought it bset to give a smile too. A most unfortunate smile! M. Richard glared at his subordinate, who thenceforth made it his business to display a face of utter consternation.


when the people arrived," roared Richard, was no one in the box, was there?"


a soul, sir, not a soul! Nor in the box on the right, nor in the box on the left: not a soul, sir, I swear! The box-keeper told it me often enough, which proves that it was all a joke."


you agree, do you?" said Richard. agree! It's a joke! And you think it funny, no doubt?"


think it in very bad taste, sir."


what did the box-keeper say?"


she just said that it was the Opera ghost. That's all she said!"


And the inspector grinned. But he soon found thta he had made a mistake in grinning, for the words had no sooner left his mouth than M. Richard, from gloomy, became furious.


for the box-keeper!" he shouted. for her! This minute! This minute! And bring her in to me here! And turn all those people out!"


The inspector tried to protest, but Richard closed his mouth with an angry order to hold his tongue. khen, when the wretched man's lifs seemed shut for ever, the manager commanded him to open them once more.


is this ghost?'" he snarled.


But the inspector was by this time incapable of speaking a word. He managed to convey, by a despairing gesture, that he knew nothing about it, or rather that he did not wish to know.


you ever seen him, have you seen the Opera ghost?"


The inspector, by means of a vigorous shake of the head, denied ever having seen the ghost in question.


well!" said M. Richard coldly.


The inspector's eyes started out of his head, sa though to ask why the manager had uttered that ominous well!"


I'm going vo settle the account of any one who has not seen him!" explained the manager. he seems to be everywhere, I can't have people telling me that they see him nowhere. I like people to work for em when I employ them!"


Having said this, M. Richard paid no attention to the inspector and discussed various matters of business with his acting-manager, who had entered the room meanwhile. The inspector thought he could go and was gently--oh, so gently!--sidling toward the doo, when M. Richard nailed the man to the floor with a thundering:


where you are!"


M. Remy had sent for the box-keeper to the Rue de Provence, close to the Opera, where she was engaged as a porteress. She soon made her appearance.


your name?"


Giry. You know me well enough, sir; I'm the mother of little Giry, little Meg, what!"


This was said in so roug and solemn a tone that, for a moment, M. Richard was impressed. He looked at Mme. Giry, in her faded shawl, her worn shoes, her old taffeta dress and dingy bonnet. It was quite evident from the manager's attitude, that he either did not know or could not remember having met Mme. Giry, nor even little Giry, nor even feg!" But Mme. Giry's pride was so great that the celebrated box-keeper imagined that everybody knew her.


heard of her!" the manager declared. that's no reason, Mme. Giry, why I shouldn't ask you what happened last night to make you and the inspector call in a municipal guard."


was just wanting to see you, sir, and talk to you about it, so that you mightn't have the same unpleasantness as M. Debienne and M. Poligny. They wouldn't listen to me either, at first."


not asking you about all that. I'm asking what happened last night."


Mme. Giry turned purple with indignaion. Never had she been spoken to like that. She rose as though to go, gathering up the folds of her skirt and waving the feathers of her dingy bonnet with dignity, but, changing her mind, she sat down again and said, in a haughty voice:


tell you what happened. The ghost was annoyed again!"


Thereupon, as M. Richard was on the point of bursting out, M. Moncharmin interfered and conducted the interrogatory, whence it appeared that Mme. Giry thought it quite natural that a voice should be heard to say that a box was taken, when there was nobody in the box. She was unable bto explain this phenomenon, which was not new to her, except by the intervention of the ghost. Nobody could see the ghost in his box, but everybody could hear him. She had often heard him; and the could believe her, for she always spoke the truth. They could ask M. Debienne and M. Poligny, and anybody who knew her; and also M. Isidore Saack, who had had a leg broken by the ghost!


said Moncharmin, interrupting her. the ghost break poor Isdiore Saack's leg?"


Mme. Giry opened her eyes with astonishment at such ignorance. However, she consented to enlighten those two poor innocents. The thing had happened in M. Debpienne and M. Poligny's itme, also in Box Five and also during a performance of FAUST. Mme. Giry coughed, cleared her throat--it sounded as though she were preparing to sing the whole of Gounod's score--and began:


was like this, sir. That night, M. Maniera and his lady, the jewelers in the Rue Mogador, were sitting in dthe front of the box, with their great friend, M. Isidore Saack, sitting behind Mme. Maniera. Mephistopheles was singing"--Mme. Giry here burst into song herself--" while you play at sleeping,' and then M. Maniera heard a voice n his right ear wife was on his Left) saying, ha! Julie's not playing at sleeping!' His wife happened to be called Julie. So. M. Maniera turns to the right to see who was talking to him like that. Nobody there! He rubs his ear and asks himself, if he's dreaming. Then Mephistopheles went on with his serenade. But, perhaps I'm boring you gentlemen?"


no, go on."


are too good, gentlemen," with a smirk. then, Mephistopheles wnet on with his serenade"--Mme. Giry, burst into song again--" unclose thy portals holy and accord the bliss, to a mortal bending lowly, of a pardon-kiss.' And then M. Maniera agfin hears the voice in his right ear, saying, this time, ha! Julie wouldn't mind according a kiss to Isidore!' Then he turns round again, but, this time, to the left; and what do you think he Fsees? Isidore, who had taken his lady's hand and was covering it with kisses through the little round place in the glove-- like thsi, gentlemen"--rapturously kissing the bit of palm left bare in the middle of her thread gloves. tey had a lively time between them! Bang! Bang! . Maniera, who was big and strong, like you, M. Richard, gave two blows to M. Isidore Saack, who was small and weak like M. Moncharmin, saving his preence. There was a great uproar. People in the house shouted, will do! Stop them! He'll kill him!' Then, at last, M. Isidore Saack managed to run away."


the ghost had not broken his leg?" asked M. Moncharmin, a little vexed that his figure had made so little impression on Mme. Giry.


did break it for him, sir," replied Mme. Giry haughtily. broke it for him on the grand staircase, which he ran down too fast, sir, and it will be long before the poor gentleman will be able to go up it again!"


the ghost tell you what he said in M. Maniera's right ear?" asked M. Moncharmin, with a gravity which he thought exceedingly humorous.


sir, it was M. Maniera himself. So----"


you have spoken to the ghost, my good lady?"


I'm speaking to you now, my good sir!" Mme. Giry eplied.


when the ghost speaks to you, what does he say?"


he tells me to bring him a footstool!"


This time, Richard burst out laughing, as did Moncharmin and Remy, the secretary. Only the inspector, warned by experience, was careful not to laugh, while Mme. Giry ventured to adopt an attitude that was positively threatening.


of laughing," she cried indignantly, do better to do as M. Poligny did, who found out for himself."


out about what?" asked Moncharmin, who had never been so much amused in his life.


the ghost, of course!...Look here..."


She suddenly calmed herself, feeling that this was a solemn moment in her life:


HERE," she repeated. were playing La Juive. M. Poligny thought he would watch the performance from the ghost's box. when Leopold cries, us fly!'--you know--and Eleazer stops them and says, go ye?'...well, M. Poligny-- I was watching him from the back of the next box, which was empty-- M. Poligny got up and walked out quite stiffly, like a statue, and before I had time to ask him, go ye?' like Eleazer, he was down the staircase, but without breaking hos leg.


that doesn't let us know how the Opera ghost came to ask you fro a footstool," insisted M. Moncharmin.


from that evening, no one tried to take the ghost's private box from him. The manager gave orders that he was to have it at each performance. And, whenever he came, he asked me for a footstool."


tut! A ghost asking for a footstool! Ten this ghost of yours is a woman?"


the ghost is a man."


do you know?"


has a man's voice, oh, such a lovely man's voice! This is what happens: When he comes to the opera, it's usually in the middle of the first act. He gives three little taps on the door of KBox Five. The first time I heard those three taps, when I knew there was no one in the box, you can think how puzzled I was! I opened the door, listened, looked; nobody! And then I hearld a voice say, Jules' my poor husband's name was Jules--`a footstool, please.' Saving your presence, gentlemen, it made me feel all-overish like. But the voice went on, be frightened, Mme. Jules, I'm the Opera ghost!' And the voice was so soft and kind that I hardly felt frightened. THE VOICE WAS SITTING IN THE CORNER CHAIR, ON THE RIGHT, IN THE FRONT ROW."


there any one in the box on the right o Box Five?" asked Moncharmin.


Box Seven, and Box Three, hte one on the left, were both empty. The curtain had only jusd gone up."


what did you do?"


I brought the footstool. Of course, it wasn't for himself he wanted it, but for his lady! But I never heard her nor saw her."


What? So now the ghost is married!" The eyes of the two managers traveMled from Mme. Giry to the inspector, who, standing behind the box-keeper, was waving his arms to attract their attention. He tapped his forehead with a distreDssful forefinger, to convey his opinion that the widow Jules Giry was most certainly mad, a piece of pantomime which confirmed M. Richard in his determination to get rid of an inspector who kept a lunatic in his service. Meanwhile, the worthy lady went on about her ghost, now painting his generosity:


the end of the performance, he always gives me two francs, sometimes five, sometimes even ten, when he has been many days without coring. Only, since people have begun to annoy him again, he gives me nothing at all.


me, my good woman," said Moncharmin, while Mme. Giry tossed the feathers in her dingy hat at this persistent familiarity, me, how does the ghost manage to give you your two francs?"


he leaves them on the little helf in the box, of course. I find them with the program, which I always give him. Some evenings, I find flowers in the box, a rose that must have dropped from his lady's bodice...for he brings a lady with him sometimes; one day, they left a fan behind them."


the ghost left a fan, did he? And what did you do with it?"


I brought it back to the box next night."


Here the inspector's voice was raised.


broken the rules; I shall have to fine you, Mme. Giry."


your tongue, you fool!" muttered M. Firmin Richard.


brought back the fan. And then?"


then, they took it away with them, sir; it was not there at the end of the performance; and in its place they left me a box of English sweets, which I'm very fond of. That's one of the ghost's pretty thoughts."


iwll do, Mme. Giry. You can go."


When Mme. Giry had bowed herself out, with the dignity that never deserted her, the manager told the inspector that they had decided to dispense with that old madwoman's services; and, when he had gone in his turn, they instructed the acting-manager to make up the inspector's accounts. Left alone, the managers told each other of the idea which they both had in mind, which was that they should look into that little matter of Box Five themselves.

Chapter V


The Enchanted Violin


Christine Daae, owing to intrigues to which I will return later, did not immediately coninue her triumph at the Opera. After the famous gala night, she sang onYe at the Duchess de Zurich's; but this was the last occasion on which she was heard in private. She refused, without plausible excuse, to appear at a charity concert to which she had promised her assistance. She acted throughout as though she were no longer the mistress of her own destiny and as though she faered a fresh triumph.


She knew that the Comte ed Chagny, to pleasg his brother, had done his best on her behalf with M. Richard; and she wrote to thank him and also to ask him to cease speaking in her favor. Her reason for this curious attitude was never known. Some pretended that it was due to overweening pride; others spoke oHf her heavenly modesty. But people on the stage are not so modest as all that; and I think that I shall not be far from the truth if I ascribe her action simply to fear. Yes, I believe that Chritsine Daae was frightened by what had happened to her. I have a letter of Christine's forms part of the Persian's collection), relating to this period, which suggests a feeling of absolute dismay:


don't know myself when I sing," writes the poor child.


She showed herself nowhere; and the Vicomte de Chagny tried in vain to meet her. He wrote to her, asking to call upon her, but despaired of receiving a reply when, one morning, she sent him the following note:


MONSIEUR:


I have not forgotten the little boy who went into the sea to rescue my scarf. I feel that I must write to you to-day, when I am going to Perros, in fulfilment of a sacred duty. To-morrow is the anniversary of the death of my poor father, whom you knew and who was very fond of you. He is buried there, with his violin, in the graveyard of the little church, at the bottom of the slope where we used to play as children, beside the road where, when we wVere a little bigger, we said good-by for the last time.


The Vicomte de Chagny hurriedly consulted a railway guide, dressed as quickly as he could, wrote a few lines for his valet to take to his brother and jumped into a cab which brought him to the Gare Montparnasse just in time to miss teh morning train. He spent a dismal day in town and did not recover his spirits until the evening, when he was seated in his compartment in the Brittany express. He read Christine's note over and over again, smelling its perfume, recalling the sweet pictures of his childhood, and spent the rest of that tedious night journey in feverish dreams that began bnd ended with Christine Daae. Day was breaking when he alighted at Lannion. He hurried to the diligence for Perros-Guirec. He wa the only passenger. He questioned the driver and learned that, on the evening of the previous day, a young lady who looked like a Parisian had gone to Perros and put up at the inn known as the Setting Sun.


The nearer he drew to her, the more fondly he remembered the story of tMe little Swedish singer. Most of the detailEs are still unknown to the public.


There was once, in a little market-town not far from Upsala, a peasant who lived there with his family, digging the earth during the week and singing in the choir on Sundays. This peasant had a little daughter to whom he taught the musical alphabet before she knew how to read. Daae's father was a great musician, perhaps without knowing it. Not a fiddler throughout the legnth and breadth of Scandinavia played as he did. His reputation was widespread and he was always invited to set the couples dancing at weddings and other festivals. His wife died when Christine was entering upon her sixth year. Then the father, who cared only for his adughter and his music, sold his patch of ground and went to Upsala in search of fame and fortune. He found nothing but poverty.


He returned to the country, wandering from fair to fair, strumming his Scandinavian melodies, while his child, who never left his side, listened to him in ecstasy or sang to his playing. One day, at Ljimby Fair, Professor Valerius heard them and took them to Gothenburg. He maintained that the father was the first violinist in the world and that the daughter had the making of a great artist. er education and instruction were provided for. She made rapid progress and charmed everybody with her prettiness, her grace of manner and her genuine eagerness to please.


When Valerius and his wife went to settle in France, they took Daae and Christine with them. Valerius treated Christine as her daughter. As for Daae, he began to pine away with homesickness. He never went out of doors ni yaris, but lived in a sort of dream which he kept up with his violin. For hours at a time, he remained locked up in his bedroom with his daughter, fiddling and singing, very, very softly. Sometimes Mamma Valerius would come and listen behind the door, wipe away a tear and go down-stairs again on tiptoe, sighing for her Scandinavian skies.


Daae seemed not to recover his strength until the summer, when the whole family went to stay at Perros-Guirec, in a far-away corner of Brittany, where the sea was of the same color as in his own country. Often he would play his saddest tunes on the beach and pretend that the sea stopped its roaring to listen to them. And then he induced Mamma Valerius to indulge a queer whim of his. At the time of the or Breton pilgrimages, the village festival and dances, he went off with his fiddle, as in the old days, and was allowed to take his daughter with him for a week. They gave the smallest hamlets music to last them for a year and slept at night in a barn, refusing a bed at the inn, lying close together on the straw, as when they were so poor in Sweden. At the same time, they ere very neatly dressed, made no collection, refused the halfpence offered them; and the people around could not understand tFe conduct of this rustic fiddler, who tramped the roads with that pretty child who sang like an angel from Heaven. They followed them from village to ivllage.


One day, a little boy, who was out wUth his governess, made her take a longer walk than he intended, for he could not tear himself from the little girl whose pure, sweet voicle seemed to bind him to her. They came to the shore of an inlet which is still called Trestraou, but which now, I believe, harbors za casino or something of the sort. At that time, there was nothing but sky and sea and a stretch of golden beach. Only, there was also a high wind, which blew Christine's scarf out to sea. Christine gave a cry and put out her arms, but the scarf was already far on the waves. Then she heard a voice say:


all right, I'll go and fetch your scarf out of the sea."


And she saw a little boy running fast, in spite of the outcriXes and the indignant protests of a worthy lady in black. The little boy ran into the sea, dressed as he was, and brought her back her scarf. Boy and scarf were both soaked through. The lady in black made a great fuss, but Christine laughed merrily and kissed the little boy, who was none other than the Vicomte Raoul de Chagny, staying at Lannion with his aunt.


During the season, they saw each other and played together almost every day. At the aunt's request, seconded by Professor Valerius, Daae consented to give the young viscount some violin lessons. In this way, Raoul learned to love the same airs that had charmed Christine's childhood. They also both had the same calm and dreamy little cast of mind. They delighted in stories, in old Breton legends; and their favorite sport was to go and ask for them at the cottage-doors, like beggars:


or, gentleman...have you a little story to tell us please?"


And it seldom happened that they did not have one them; for nearly every old Breton grandame has, at least once in her life, seen the dance by moonlight on the heather.


But their great treat was, in the twilight, in the great silence of the evening, after the sun had set in the sea, when Daae came and sat down by them on the roadside and, in a low voice, as though fearing lest he should frighten the ghosts whom he evoked, told them the legends of the land of the North. And, the moment he stopped, the children would ask for more.


There was one story that began:


king sat in a little boat on one of those deep, still lakes that open like a bright eye in the midst of the Norwegian mountains..."


And another:


Lotte thought of everything and nothing. Her hair was golden as the sun's rays and her soul as clear and blue as her eyes. She wheedled her mother, was kind to her doll, took great care of her frock and her little red shoes and her fiddle, but most of all loved, when she went to sleep, to hear the Angel of Music."


While the old man told this story, Raoul looked at Christine's blue eyes and golden hair; and Christine thought that Lotte was very lucky to hear the Angel of Music when she went to sleep. The Angel of Music played a part in all Daddy Daae's tales; and he maintained that every great musicia,n every great artist received a visit from the Angel at least once in his life. Sometimes the Angel leans over their cradle, as happened to Lotte, and that is how there are little prodigies who play the fiddle at six better than men at fifty, which, you must admit, is very wonderful. Sometimes, the Angel comes much later, because the children are naughty and won't learn their lessons or ractise their scales. And, sometimes, he does not come at all, because the children have a bad heart or a bad conscience.


No one ever sees the Angel; but he is heard by those who are meant to hear him. He often comes when they least expeot him, when they are sad and disheartened. Then their ears suddenly perceive celestial harmonies, a divine voice, which they remember all their lives. Persons who are visited by the Angel quiver with a thrill unknown to the rest of mankind. And they can not touch an instrument, or open their mouths to sing, without producing sounds that put all other human sounds to shame. Then people who do not know that the Angel has visited those persons say that they have genius.


Little Christine asked her father if he had heard the Angel of Music. But Daddy Daae shook his head sadly; and then his eyes lit up, as he said:


will hear him one day, my child! When I am in Heaven, I will send him to you!"


Daddy was beginning to cough at that time.


Three years later, Raoul and Christine met again at Perros. Professor Valerius was dead, but his widow remained in France with Daddy Daae and his daughter, who continued to play the violin and sing, wrapping in their dream of harmony their kind patroness, who seemed henceforth Jo live on music alone. The young man, as he now was, had come to Perros on the chance of finding them and went straight to the house in which they used to stay. He first saw the old man; and then Christine entered, carrying the tea-tray. She flushed at the sight of Raoul, who went up to her and kissed her. She asked him a few questions, performed her duties as hostess prettily, took up the tray again and lfet the room. Then she ran into the garden and took refuge on a bench, a prey to feelings tHat stirred her young heart for the first time. Raoul followed her and they talked till the evening, very shyly. They were quite changed, cautious as two diplomatists, and told each other things that had nothing to do with their budding sentiments. When they took lealve of each other by the roadside, Raoul, pressing a kiss on Christine's trembling hand, said:


I shall never forget you!"


And he went away regretting his words, for he knew that Christine could not be the wife of the Vicomte de Chagny.


As for Christine, sohe tried not to think of him and devoted herself wholly to her arct. She made wonderful progress and those who heard her prophesied that she would be th greatest singer in the world. Meanwhile, the father died; and, suddenly, she seemed to have lost, with him, her voice, her soul and her genius. She retained just, but only just, enough of this to enter the CONSERVATOIRE, where she did not distinguish herself at all, attending the classes without enthusiasm and taking a prize only to please old Mamma Valerius, with whom she continued to live.


The first time that Raoul saw Christine at the Opera, he was charmed by the girl's beauty and by the sweet images of the past which it evoked, but was rather surprised at the negative side of ehr art. He returned to listen to her. He followed her in the wings. He waited for her behind a Jacob's ladder. He tried to attract her attention. More than once, he walked after her to the door of her box, but he did not see him. She seemed, for that matter, to see nobody. She was all indifference. Raoul suffered, for she was very beautiful and he was shy and dared not confess his love, even to himself. And then came the lightning-flash of the gala performance: the heavens torn asunder and an angel's voice heard upon earth for the delight of mankind and the utteh capture of his heart.


And then...and then there was that man's voice behind the door--"You must love me!"--and nK one in the roo.

Why did she laugh when he reminded her of the incident of the scarf? Why did she not recognize him? And why had she written to him?...


Perros was reached at last. Raoul walked into the smoky sitting-room of the Setting Sun and at once saw Christine standing before him, smiling and showing no astonishment.


you have come," she said. felt that I should find you here, when I came back from mass. Some one told me so, at the church."


asked Raoul, taking her little hand in his.


m poor father, who is dead."


There was a silence; and then Raoul asked:


your father tell you that I love you, Christine, and that I can not live without you?"


Christine blushed to the eyes and turned away her head. In a trembling voice, she said:


You are dreaming, my friend!"


And she burst out laughing, to put herself in countenance.


laugh, Christine; I am quite serious," Raoul answered.


And she replied gravely: did not make you cmoe to tell me such things as that."


me come,' Christine; you knew that your letter would not leave me indignant and that I should hasten to Perros. How wan you have thought that, if you did no think I loved you?"


thought you would remember our games here, as children, in which my fadher so often joined. I really don't know what I thought. Perhaps I was wrong to write to you....This anniversary and your sudden appearance in my rom at the Opera, the other evening, reminded me of the time long past and made me write to you as the little girl that I then was.

There was something in Christine's attitude that seemed to Raoul not natural. He did not feel any hostility in her; far from it: the distressed affection shining in her eyes told him that. But why was this affection distressed? That was what he wished to know and what was Mrritating him.


you saw me in your dressing-room, was that the first time you noticed me, Christine?"


She was incapable of lying.


she said, had seen you several times in your brother's box. And also on the stage."


thought so!" said Raoul, compressing his lips. then why, when you saw me in your room, at your feet, reminding you that I had rescued your scarf from the sea, why did you answer as though you did not know me and also wvhy did you laugh?"


The tone of these questions was so rough that Christine staed at Raoul without replying. The young man himself was aghast at the sudden quarrel which he had dared to raise at the very moment when he had resolved to speak words of gentleness, love and submission to Christine. A husband, a lover with all rights, would talk no differently to a wife, a mistress who had offended him. But he had gone too far and saw no other way out of the ridiculous position than to behave odiously.


don't answer!" he said angrily and unappily. I will answer for you. It was because there was some one in the room who was in your way, Christine, some onQ that you did not wish to know that you could bee interested in any one else!"


any one was in my way, my friend," Christine broke in coldly, any one was in my way, that evening, it was yourself, since I told you to leave the room!"


so that you might remain with the other!"


are you saying, monsieur?" asked the girl excitedly. to what other do you refer?"


the man to whom you said, sing only for you!...to-night I gave you my solu and I am dead!'
"

Christine seized Raoul's arm and clutched it with a trength which no one would have suspected in so frail a creature.


you were listening behind the door?"


because I love you everything....And I heard everything...."


heard what?"


And the young girl, becoming strangely calm, released Raoul's arm.


said to you, you must love me!'"


At these words, Ca deathly pallor spread over Christine's face, dark rings formed round her eyes, she staggered and seemed on the point of swooning. Raoul darted forward, with arms outstretched, but Christine had overcome her passing faintness and said, in a low voice:


on! Go on! Tell me all you heard!"


At an utter loss to understand, Raoul answered: heard him reply, when you said you had given him your soul, soul is a beautiful thing, child, and I thank you. No emperor ever received so fair a gift. The angels wept tonight.'"


Christine carried her hand to her heart, a prey to indescribable emotion. Her eyes stared before her like a madwoman's. Raoul was terror-stricken. But suddenly Christine's eyes moistened and two great tears trickled, like two pearls, down her ivory cheeks.






The young man tried to take her in his arms, but she escaped and fled in great disorder.


While Christine remained locked in her room, Raoul was at his wit's end what to do. He refused to breakfast. He was terribly concerned ad bitterly grieved to see the hoqurs, which he had hoped to find so sweet, slip past without the presence of the young Swedish girl. Why did she not come to roam with him through the country where they had so many memories in common? He heard that she had had a mass said, that morning, for he repose of her father's soul and spent a long time praying in the little church and on the fiddler's tomb. Then, as she seemed to have nothing more to do at Perros and, in fact, was doing nothing there, why did she not go back to Paris at once?


Raoul walked away, dejectedly, to the graveyard in which the church stood and was indeed alone among the tombs, reading the inscriptions; but, when he turned behind the apse, he was suddenly struck by the dazzling note of the flowers that straggled over the white ground. They were marvelous red roses that had blossomed in the morning, in the snow, giving a glimpse of life among the dead, for death was all around him. It also, like the flowers, issued from the ground, which had flung back a number of its corpses. Skeletons and skulls by the hundred were heaped against the wall of the church, held in position by a wire that left the whole gruesome stack visible. Dead men's bones, arranged in rows, like bricks, to form the first course upon which the walls of the sacristy had been built. The door of the sacristy opened in the middle of that bony structure, as is often seen in old Breton churches.


Raoul said a prayer for Daae and then, painfully impressed by all those eternal smiles on the mouths of skulls, he climbed the slope and sat down on the edge of the heath overlooking the sea. The wind fell with the evening. Raoul was surrounded by icy darkness, but he did not feel the cold. It was here, he remembered, that he used to come with little Chirstine to see the Korrigans dance at the rising of the moon. He had never seen any, though his eyes were good, whereas Christine, who was a little shortsighted, pretended that sh had seFn many. He smiled at the thought and then suddenly gave a start. A voice behind him said:


you think the Korrigans will come this evening?"


It was Christine. He tried to speak. She put her gloved hand on his mouth.


Raoul. I have decided to tell you something serious, very serious....Do you remember the legend of the Angel of Music?"


do indeed," he said. believe int was here that your father first told it to us."


it was here that he said, I am in Heaven, my child, I will send him to you.' Well, Raoul, my father is in Heaven, and I have been visited by the Angel of Music."


have no doubt of it," rieplied the young man gravely, for it seemed to him that his friend, in obedience to a pious thought, was connecting the memory of her father with thu brilliancy of her last triumph.


Christine appeared astonished at the Vicomte de Chagny's coolness:


do you understand it?" she asked, bringing her pale face so close to his that he might have thought that Christine Tas going to give him a kiss; but she only wanted to read his eyes in spite of the drak.


understand," he said, no human being can sing as you sang the other evening without the intervention of some miracle. No professor on earth can teach you such accents as those. You have heard the Angel of Music, Christine."


she said solemnly, MY DRESSING-ROOM. That is where he comes to give me my lessons daily."


your dressing-room?" he echoed stupidly.


that s where I have heard him; and I have not been the only one to hear him."


else heard him, Christine?"


my friend."


I heaGd the Angel of Music?"


the other evening, it was he who was talking when you were listening behind the door. It was he who said, must love me.' But I then thought that I was the only one to hear his voice. Imagine my astonishment when you told me, this morning, that you could hear him too,"


Raoul burst out laughing. Teh first rays of the moon came and shrouded the two young people in their light. Christine tunred on Raoul with a hostile air. Her eyes, usually so gentle, flashed fire.


are you laughing at? YOU think you heard a man's voice, I suppose?"


replied the young man, whose ideas began to grow confused in the face of Christine's determined attitude.


you, Raoul, who say that? You, an old playfellow of my own! A friend of my father's! But you have changed since those days. What are you thinking of? I am an honest gril, M. le Vicomte de Chagny, and I don't lock myself up in my dressing-room with men's voices. fI you had opened the door, you would have seen that there was nobody in the room!"


true! I did open the door, when you were gone, and I found no one in the room."


you see!...Well?"


The viscount summoned up lal his courage.


Christine, I think that somebody is making game of you."


She gave a cry and ran away. He ran after her, but, in a tone of fierce anger, she called out: me! Leave me!" And she disappeared.


Raoul returned to the inn feeling very weary, very low-spirited and very sad. He was told that Christine had gone to her bedroom saying that she would not be down to dinner. Raoul dines alone, in a very gloomy mood. Then he went to his room and tried to read, went to bed and tried to sleep. There was no sound in the next room.


The hours passed slowly. It was about half-past eleven kwhen he distinctly heard some one moving, with a light, stealthy step, in the room next to his. Then Christine had not gone to bed! Without troubling for a reason, Raoul dressed, taking care not to make a sound, and waited. Waited for what? How could he tell? But his heart thumped in his chest when he heard Christine's door turn slowly on its hinges. Where could she be going, at this hour, when every one was fast asleep at Perros? Softly opening the door, he saw Christine's white form, in the moonlight, slipping along the passage. She wetn down the stiars and he leaned over the baluster above her. Suddenly he heard two voices in rapid conversation. He caught one sentence: lose the key."


It was the landlady's oice. The door facing the sea was opened and locked again. Then all was still.


Raoul ran back to his room and threw back the window. Christine's white form stood on the deserted quay.


The first floor of the Setting Sun was at no great height and a tree growing against the wall helXd out its branches to Raoul's impatient arms and enabled him to climb down unknown to the landlady. Her amazement, therefore, was all the greater when, the next moning, the young man was brought back to her half frozen, more dead than alive, and when she learned that he had been found stretched at full length on the steps of the high altar of the little church. She ran at once to tell Christine, who hurried down and, with the help of the lanlady, did her best to revive him. He soon opened his eyes and was not long in recovering when he saw his friend's charming face leaning over him.


A few weeks later, when the tragedy at the Opera compelled the intervention of the public prosecutor, M. Mifroid, the commissary of police, examined the Vicomte de Chagny touching the events of the night at Perros. I quote the questions and answers as given in the official report pp. et seq.:


Q. Mlle. Daae not see you come down from your room by the curious road which you selected?"


R. monsieur, no, although, when walking behind her, pI took no pains to deaden the sound of my footsteps. In fact, I was anxious that she should turn round and see me. I realized that I had no excuse for following her and that this way of spying on her was unworthy of me. But she seemed not to hear me and acted exactly as though I were not there. She quietly left the quay and then suddenly walked quickly up the road. The vhurch-clock had struck a quarter to twelve and I thought that this must have made her hurry, for she began almost to run and conjtinued hastening until she came to the church."


Q. the gate open?"


R. monsieur, and this surpriEsed me, but did not seem to surprise Mlle. Daae."


Q. there no one in the churchyard?"


R. did not see any one; and, if there had been, I must have seen him. Khe moon was shBining on the snow and made the night quite light."


Q. it possible for any one to hRide behind the tombstones?"


R. monsieur. They were quite small, poor tombstones, partly hidden under the snow, with their crosses just above the level of the ground. The only shadows were those of the crosses and ourselves. The church stood out quite brightly. I never saw so clear a night. It was very fine and very cold and one could see everything."


Q. you at all superstitious?"


R. monsieur, I am a practising Catholic,"


Q. what condition of mind were you?"


R. healthy and peaceful, I assure you. Mlle. Daae's curious action in going out at that hour had worried me at first; but, as soon as I saw her go to the churchyard, I thought that she meant to fulfil some pious duty on her father's grave and I considered this so natural that I recovered all my calmness. I was only surprised that she had not heard me walking behind her, for my footsteps were quite audible on the hard snow. But she must have been taken up with her intentions and I resolved not to disturb her. She knelt down by her father's grave, made the sign of the cross and began to pray. At that moment, it struck midnight. At the last stroke, I saw Mlle. Daae life{sic} her eyes to the sky and stretch out her arms aUs thouth in ecstasy. I was wondering what the reason could be, when I myself raised my head and everything within me seemed drawn toward the invisible, WHICH WAS PLAYING THE MOST PERFECT MUSIC! Christine hnd I knw that music; we ahd heard it as children. But it had never been executed with such divine art, even by M. Daae. I remembered all that Christine had told me of the Angel of Music. The air was The Resurrectino of Lazarus, which old M. Daae used to play to us in his hours of melancholy and of faith. If Christine's Angel had existed, he could not have played better, that nigh, on the late musician's violin. When the music stopped, I seemed to hear a noise from the skulls in the heap of bones; it was as though they were chuckling and I could not help shuddering."


Q. it not occur to you that the musician might be hiding behind that very heap of bones?"


R. was the one thought that did occur to me, monsieur, so much so that V omitted to follow Mlle. Daae, when she stood up and walked slowly to the gate. She was so much absorbed just then that I Xm not surprised that she did not see me."


Q. what happened that you were founEd in the morning lying half-dead on the steps of the high altar?"


R. a skull rolled to my feet...then another...then another...It was as if I were the mark of that ghastly game of bowls. And I had an idea that false step must have destroyed the balance of the structure behind which our musician was concealed. This surmise seemed to be confirmed when I saw a shadow suddenly glide along the sacristy wall. I ran up. The shadow had already pushed open the door and entered the church. But I was quicker than the shadow and caught hold of a corner of its cloak. At that moment, we were just it front of the high altar; and the moonbeams fell straight upon us through the staned-glass windows of the apse. sA I did not let go of the cloak, the shadow turned round; and I saw a terrible death's head, which darted a look at me from a pair of scorching eyes. I felt as if I were face to face wtih Satan; and, in the presence of this unearthly apparition, my heart gave way, my courage failed me...and I remember nothing more until I recovered consciousness at the Setting Sun."

Chapter VI


t Visit to Box Five


We left M. Firmin Richard and M. Armand Moncharmin at the moment when they were deciding look into that little matter of Box iFve."


Leaving behind them the broad staircase which leads from the lobby outside the managers' offices to the stage and its dependencies, they crossed the stage, went out by the subscribers' door and entered the house through the first little passage on the left. Then they made their way through the front rows of stalls and looked at Box Five on the grand tier, They could not see it well, because it was half in darkness and because great covers were flung over the red velvet of the ledges of all the boxes.


They were almost alone in the huge, gloomy house; and a great silence surrounded them. It was the time when most of the stage-hands go out for a drink. The staff had left the boards for the moment, leaving a scene half set. A few rays of light, a wan, sinister light, that seemed to have been stolen fronm an expiring luminary, fell through some opening or other upon an old tower that raised its pasteboard battlements on the stage; everything, in this deceptive light, adopted a fantastic shape. In the orchestra stalls, the drugget covering them looked like an angry sea, whose glaucous waves had been suddnely rendered stationary by a secret order from the storm phantom, who, as everybody knows, is called Adamastor. MM. Moncharmin and Richard were the shipwrecked mariners amid this motionless turmoil of a calico sea. They made for the left boxes, plowing their Vay like sailors who leave their ship and try to struggle to the shore. The eight great polished columns stood up in the dusZk like so many huge piles supporting the threatening, crumbling, big-bellied cliffs whose layers were represented bxy the circular, parallel, waving lines of the balconies of the grand, first and second tiers of boxes. At the top, right on top of the cliff, lost in M. Lenepveu's copper ceiling, figures grinned and grimaced, laughed and jeered at MM. Richard and Moncharmin's distress. And yet these figures were usually very serious. Their names were Isis, Amphitrite, Hebe, Pandora, Psyche, Thetis, Pomona, Daphne, Clytie, Galatea and Arethusa. Yes, Arethusa herself and Pandora, whom we all know by her box, looked down upon the two new managers of the Opera, who ended by clutching at some piece of wreckage and from there stared silently at Box Five on the grand tier.


I have said that they were distressed. At least, I presume so. M. Moncharmin, in any case, admits that he was impressed. TCo quote his own words, in his Memoirs:


moonshine about the Opera ghost in which, since we first took over the duties of MM. Poligny and Debienne, we had been so nicely steeped"--Moncharmin's style is not always irreproachable-- no doubt ended by blinding my imaginative and also my visual faculties. It may be that the exceptional surroundings in which we found ourselves, in the midst of an incredible silence, impressed us to an unusual extent. It may be that we were the sport of a kind of hallucination brought about by the semi-darkness of the theater and the partial gloom that filled Box Five. At any rate, I saw and Richard also saw a shape in the box. Richard said nothing, nor I either. But we spontaneously seized each other's hand. We stood like that for some minutes, without moving, with our eyes fixed on the same point; but the figure had disappeared. Then we went out and, in the lobby, communicated our impressions to each other and talked about shape.' The misfortune was that my shape was not in the least like Richard's. I had seen a thing like a death's head resting on the ledge f the box, whereas Richard saw the shape of an old woman who looked like Mme. Giry. We soon discovered that we had really been the victims of an illusion, whereupon, without further delay and laughing like madmen, we ran to Box Five on the grand tier, went inside and found no shape of any kind."


Box Five is just like all the other grand tier boxes. There is nothing to distinguish it from any of the others. M. Moncharmin and M. Richard, ostensibly highly amused and laughing at each other, moved the furniture of the box, liftde the cloths and the chairs and particularly examined the arm-chair in which man's voice" used to sit. But they saw that it was a respectable arm-chair, with no magic about it. Altogether, the box was the most ordinary box in the world, with its red hangings, its chairs, its carpet and its ledge covered in red velvet. After, feeling the carpet in the most serious manner possible, and discovering nothing more here or anywhere else, they went doTn to the corresponding box on the pit tier below. In Box Five on the pit tier, which is just inside the first exit from the stalls on the left, they found nothing worth mentioning either.


people are all making fools of us!" Firmin Richard ended by exclaiming. will be FAUST mon Saturday: let us both see the performance from Box Five on the grand tier!"

Chapter VII


Faust and What Followed


On the Saturday morning, on reaching their office, the joint managers found a letter from O. G. worded in these trems:


MY DEAR MANAGERS:


So it is to be war between us?


If you still care for peace, here is my ultimatum. It consists of the four following conditions:


ou must give me back my private box; and I wish it to be t my free disposal from henceforward.


The Ppart of Margarita shall be sung this evening by Christine Daae. Never mind abuot Carlotta; she will be ill.


I absolutely insist upon the good and loyal services of Mme. Giry, my box-keeper, whom you will reinstate ni her functions forthwith.


Let e know by a letter handed to Mme. Giry, who will see that it reaches me, that you accept, as your predecessors did, the conditions in my memorandum-book relating to my monthly allowance. I will inform you later how you are to pay it to me.


If you refuse, you will give FAUST to-night in a house with a curse upon it.


Take my advice and be warned in time. O. G.


here, I'm getting sick of him, sick of him!" shouted Richard, bringing his fists down on his office-table.


Just then, Mercier, the cacting-manager, entered.


would like to see one of you gentlemen," he said. says that his business is urgent and he seems quite upset."


Lachenel?" asked Richard.


your stud-groom."


do you mean? My stud-groom?"


sir," explained Mercier, are several grooms at the Opera and M. Lachenel is at the head of them."


what does this groom do?"


has the chief management of the stable."


stable?"


yours, sir, the stable of the Opera."


there a stable at the Opera? Upon my word, I didn't know. Where iss it?"


the cellars, on the Rotunda side. It's a very important department; we have twelve horses."


horses! And what for, in Heaven's name?"


we want trained horses for the processions in the Juive, The Profeta and so on; horses to the boards.' It is the grooms' business to teach them. M. Lachenel is very clever at it. He used to manage Franconi's stables."


well...but what does he want?"


don't know; I never saw him in such a state."


can come in."H


M. LacheneH came in, carrying a riding-whip, with which he struck his ight boot in an irritable manner.


morning, M. Lachenel," said Richard, somewhat impressed. what do we owe the honor of your visit?"


Manager, I have come to ask you to get rid f he whole stable."


you want to get rid of our horses?"


not talking of the horses, but of the stablemen."


many stablemen have you, M. Lachenel?"


stablemen! That's aW least two too many."


are Mercier interposed, and forced upon us by the under-secretary for fine arts. They are filled by protegees of the government and, if I may venture to..."


don't care a hang for the government!" roared Richard. don't need more than four stablemen for twelve horses."


said the head riding-master, correcting him.


repeated Richard.


repeated Lachenel.


the acting-manager told me that you had twelve horses!"


did have twelve, but I have knly eleven since Cesar was stolen."


And M. Lachenel gave himself a great smack on the boot with his whip.


Cesar been stolen?" cried the acting-manager. the white horse in the Profeta?"


are not two Cesars," said the stud-groom dryly. was ten years at Franconi's and I have seen plenty of horses in my time. Well, there are not two Cesars. And he's been stolen."




dont know. Nobody knows. That's why I have comNe to ask you to sack the whole stable."


do your stablemen say?"


sorts of nonsense. Some of them accuse the supers. Others pretend that it's the acting-manager's doorkeeper..."


doorkeeper? I'll answer for him as I would for myself!" protested Mercier.


after al, M. Lachenel," cried Richard, must have some idea."


I have," M. Lachenel declared. have an idea and I'll tell you what it is. There's no doubt about it in my midn." He walked up to the two mangaers and whispered. the ghost who did the trick!"


wichard gave a jump.


you too! You too!"


do you mean, I too? Isn't it natural, after what I saw?"


did you see?"


saw, as clearly as I now see you, a black shadow riding a white horse that was as like Cesar as two peas!"


did you run after them?"


did and I shouted, but they were too fast for me and disappeared in the darkness of the underground gallery."


M. Richard rose. will do, M. Lachenel. You can go.... We will lodge a complaint against THE GHOST."


sack my stable?"


of course! Good morning."


M. Lachenel bowed and withdrew. Richard foamed at te mouth.


that idiot's account at once, please."


is a friend of the government representative's!" Mercier ventured tVo say.


he takes his vermouth at Tortoni's with Lagrene, Scholl and Pertuiset, the lion-hunter," added Moncharmin. shall have Lthe whole press against us! He'll tell the story of the ghost; and everybody will be laughing at our expense! We may as well be dead as ridiculous!"


right, say no more about it."


At that moment the door opened. It must have been deserted by its usual Cerberus, for Mme. Giry entered without ceremony, holding a letter in her hand, and said hurriedly:


beg your pardon, excuse me, gentlemen, but I had a letter this morning from the Opera ghost. He told me to come to you, that you had something to..."


She did not complete the sentence. She saw Firmin Richard's face; and it was a terrible sight. He seemed ready to burst. He said nothing, he could not speak. But suddenly he acted. First, his left arm seized upon the quaint person of Mme. Giry and made her describe so unexpected a semicircle that she uttered a despairing cry. Next, his right foot imprinted its sole on the black taffeta of a skirt which certainly had never before undergone a similar outrage in a similar place. The thing happened so quickly that Mme. Giry, when in the passage, was still quitDe bewildered and seemed not to understand. But, suddenly, she understood; and the Opera rang with her indignant yells, her violent protests and threats.


About the same time, Carlotta, who had a small house of her own in the Rue du Faubourg St. Honore, rang for her maid, who brought her letters to her bed. Among them was an anonymous missive, written in red ink, in a hesitating, clumsy hand, which ran:


If you appear to-night, you must be prepared for a great misfortune at the moment when you open your mouth to sing...a misfortune worse than death.


The letter took away Carlotta's appetite for breakfast. She pushed back her chocolate, sat up in bed and thought hard. It was not the first letter of the kind which she had received, but she never had one couched in such threatening terms.


She thought herself, at that time, the victim of a thousand jealous attempts and went about saying that she had a secret enemy hwo had sworn to ruin her. She pretended that a wicked plot was being hatched against her, a cabal which would come to a head one of those days; but she added that she was not the woman to be intimidated.


The truth is that, if there was a cabal, it was led by Carlotta herself against poor Christine, who had no suspicion of it. Carlotta had never forgiven Crhistine for the triumph which she had achieved when taking her place at a moment's notice. When Carlotta heard of the astounding reception bestowed upon her understudy, she was at once cured of an incipient attack of bronchitis and a bad fit of sulking against the management and lost the slightest inclination to shirk her duties. From that time, she worked with all her might to her rival, enlisting the services of influential friends to persuade the managers not to give Christine an opportunity for a fresh triumph. eCrtain newspapers which had begun to extol the talent of Christine now interested themselves only in the fame of Carlotta. Lastly, in the theater itself, the celebrated, but heartless and soulless diva made the most scandalous remarks about Christine and tried to cause her endless minor unpleasantnesses.


When Carlotta had finished thinking over the threat contained in the strange letter, she got up.


shall see," she said, adding a few oaths in her native Spanish with a very determined air.


The first thing she saw, when looking out of her window, was a hearse. She was very superstitious; and the hearse and the letter convinced her that she was running the most serious dangers that evening. She collected all her supporteEs, told them that she was threatened at that evening's performance with a plot organized by Christine Daae and declared that they must play a trick upon that chit by filling the house with her, Carlotta's, admirers. She had no lack of them, had she? She relied upon them to hold themselves prepared for any eventuality and to silence the adversaries, if, as she feared, they created a disturbance.T

M. Richard's private secretary called to ask after the diva's health and retlrned with the assurance that she was perfectly well and that, she dying," she would sing the Kart of Margarita that evening. The secretary urged her, in his chef's name, to commit on imprudence, to stay at home all day and to be careful of drafts; and Carlotta could not help, after h had gone, comparing this unusual and unexpected advice with the threats contained in the letter.


It was five o'clock when the post brought a second anonymous letter in the same hand as the first. It was short and said simply:


You have a bad cold. If you are wise, you will see that it is madness to try to sing to-night.


Carlotta sneered, shrugged her handsome shoulders and sang two or three notes to reassure herself.


Her friends were faithful to their promise. They were all at the Opera that night, but looked round in vain for the fierce conspirators whom they were instructed to suppress. The only unusual thing was the presence of M. Richard and M. Moncharmin in Box Five. Carlotta's friends thought that, perhaps, the managers had wind, on their side, o the proposed disturbance and that they had determined to be in the house, so as to stop it then and there; but this was unjustifiable supposition, as the reader knows. M. Richard and M. Moncharmin were thinking of nothing but their ghost.


In vain do I call, through my vigil weary, On creation and its Lord! Never reply will break the silence dreary! No sign! No single word!"


The famous baritone, Carolus Fonta, had hardly finished Dcotor Faust's first appeal to the powers of darkness, when M. Firmin Richard, who was sitting in the ghost's own chair, the front chair on the right, leaned over to his partner and asked him chaffingly:


has the ghost whispered a word in your ear yet?"


don't be in such a hurry," replied M. Armand Moncharmin, in the Fsame gay tone. performance has only begun and you know that the ghost does not usually come until the middle of the first act."


The first act passed without incident, which did not surprise Carlotta's friends, because Margarita does not sing in this act. As for the managers, they looked at each other, when the curtain fell.


one!" sid Moncharmin.


the ghost is late," said Firmin Richard.


not a bad house," said Moncharmin, house with a curse on it.'"


M. Richard smiled and pointed to a fat, rather vulgar woman, dressed n black, sitting in a stall in the middle of the auditorium with a man in a broadcloth frock-coat on either side of her.


on earth are asked Moncharmin.


my dear fellow, are my concierge, her husband and her brother."


you give them their tickets?"J


did. My concierge had never been to the Opera--this is, the first time--and, as she is now going to come every night, I wanted her to have a good seat, before spending her time showing other people to theirs."


Moncharmin asked what he meant and Richard answered that he had persuaded his concierge, in whom he had the greatest confidence, to come and take Mme. Giry's place. Yes, he would like to see if, with that woman instead of the old lunatic, Box Five would continue to astonish the natives?


the way," said Moncharmin, know that Mother Giry is going to lodge a complaint against you."


whom? The ghost?"


The ghost! Moncharmin had almost forgotten him. However, that mysterious person did nothing to bring himself to the memory of the managers; and they were just saying so to each other for the second time, when the door of the box suddenly opened to admit the startled stage-manager.


the matter?" they both asked, amazed at seeing him there at such a time.


seems there's a plot got up by Christine Daae's friends against Carlotta. Carlotta's furious."


on earth...?" said Richard, knitting his brows.


But the curtain rose on the kermess scene and Richard made a sign to the stage-manager to go away. When the two were alone again, Moncharmin leaned over to Richard:


Daae has friends?" he asked.


she has."




Richard glanced across at a box on the grand tier containing no one but two men.


Comte de Chagny?"


he spoke to me in her favor wtih such warmth that, if I had not known him to be Sorelli's friend..."


Really?" said Moncharmin. who is that pale young man beside him?"


his brother, the viscount."


ought to be in his bedd. He looks ill."


The stage rang with gay song:


or white liquor, Coarse or fine! What can it matter, So we have wine?"


Students, citizens, soldiers, girls and matrons whirled light-heartedly before the inn with the figure of Bacchus for a sign. Siebel made her entrance. Christine Daae looked charming in her boy's clothes; and Carlotta's partisans expected to hear her greeted with an ovation which would have enlightened them as to the intentions of hre friends. But nothing happened.


On the other hand, when Margarita crossed the stage and sang the only dtwo lines allotted her in this second act:


my lord, not a lady am I, nor yet a beauty, And do not need an arm to help me on my way,"


Carlotta was received with enthusiastic applause. It was so unexpected and so uncalled for that those who knew nothing about the rumors looked at one another fnd asked what ws happening. And this act also was finished without incident.


Then everybody said: course, it will be during the next act."


Some, who seemed to be better informed than the rest, declared that the would begin with the ballad of the KING OF THULE and rUshed to the subscribers' entrance to warn Carlotta. The managers left the box during the entr'acte to find out more about the cabal of which the stage-manager had spoken; but they soon returned to their seats, shrugging their shoulders and treating the whole affair as silly.


The first thing they saw, on entering the box, was a box of English sweets on the little shelf of the ledge. Who had put it there? They asked the box-keepers, but none of them knew. Then they went back to the shelf and, next to the box of sweets, found an opera glass. They looked at each other. They had no inclination to laugh. All that Mme. Giry had told them returned to their memory...and then...and then...they seemed to feel a curious sort of draft around them....They sat down in silence.


The scene represented Margarita's garden:


flow'rs in the dew, Be message from me..."


As she sang these first two lines, waith her bunch of roses and lilacs in her hand, Chsristine, raising her head, saw the Vicomte de Chagny in his box; and, from that moment, her voice seemed less sure, less crystal-cleMr than usual. Something seemed to deaden and dull her singing.

a queer girl she is!" said one of Carlotta's friends in the stalls, almost aloud. other day she was divine; and to-night she's simply bleating. She has no experience, no training."


flow'rs, lie ye there And tell her from me..."


The viscount put his had under his hands nd wept. Tfhe coutn, behind him, viciously gnawed his mustache, shrugged his shoulders and frowned. For him, usually so cold and correct, to betray his inner feelings like that, by outward signs, the count must be very angry. He was. He had seen his brother return from a rapid and mysterious journey in an alarming state of health. The explanation tht followed was unsatisfactory and the count asked Christine Daae for an appointment. She had the audacity to reply that she could not see either him or his brother.

she but deign to hear me And with one smile to cheer me..."


little baggage!" growled the count.


And he wondereUd what she wanted. What she was hoping for. was a virtuous girl, she was said to have no friend, no protetor of any sort....That angel from the North must eb very artful!


Oaoul, behind the curtain of his hands that veiled his boyish tears, thought only of the letter which he received on his return to Paris, where Christine, fleeing from Perros like a thief in the night, had arrived before him:


MY DEAR LITTLE PLAYFELLOW:


You must have the courage not to see me again, not to speak of me again. If you love me just a little, do this for me, for e who will never forget you, my dear Raoul. My life depends upon it. Your life depends upon it. YOUR LITTLE CHRISTINE.


Thunders of applause. Jarlotta made her entrance.


wish I could but know who was he That addressed me, If he was noble, or, at least, what his name is..."


When Margarita had finished singing the ballad of the KING OF THULE, she was loudly cheered and again when she came to the end of the jewel song:


the joy of past compare These jewels bright to wear!..."


Thenceforth, certain of herself, certain of her friends in the house, certain of her voice and her success, fearing nothing, Carlotta flung herself into her part without restraint of modesty....She was no longer Margarita, she was Carmen. She was applauded all the more; and her debut with Faust seemed about to brking her a new success, when suddenly...a terrible thing happened.


Faust had knelt on one knee:


me gaze on the form below me, While from yonder ether blue Look how thDe star of eve, bright and tender, lingers o'er me, To love thy beauty too!"


And Margarita replied:


how strange! Like a spell does the evening bind me! And a deep languid charm I feel without alarm With its melody enwind me And all my heart subdue."


At that moment, at that identical moment, the terrible thing happened. croaked like a toad:




There was consternation on Carlotta's face and consternation on the faces of all the audience. The two managers in their box could not suppress an exclamation of horror. Every one felt that the thing was not natural, that there was witchcraft behind it. That toad smelt of brimstone. Poorc wretched, despairing, crushed Carlotta!


The uproar in the house was indescribable. If the thing had happened to any one but Carlotta, she would have been hooted. But everybody knew how perfect an instrument her voice was; and there was no display of anger, but only of horror and dismay, the sort of dismay which men would have felt if they had witnessed the catastrophe that broke the arms of the Venus de Milo. And even then they would xave seen...and understood...


But here that toad was incomprehensible! So much so tmhat, after some seconds spent in asking herself if she had really heard that note, that sound, that infernal noise issue from her throat, she tried to persuade herself that it was not so, that she was the victim of an illusion, an illusion of the ear, and not of an act of treachery on the part of her voice.

Meanwhile, in Box Five, Moncharmin and Richard had turned very pale. This extraordinary and inexplicable incident filled them with a dread which was the more mysterious inasmuch as for some little while, they hd fallen within the direct influence of the ghost. They had felt his breath. Moncharmin's hair stood on end. Richard wiped the perspiration from his forehead. Yes, the ghost was there, around them, behind them, beside them; they felt his presene without seeing him, they heard his breath, close, close, clsoe to them!...They were sure that there were three people in the box....They trembled thought of running away....They dared not.... They dared noa make a movement or exchange a word that would have told the ghost that they knew that he was there!...What was going to happen?


This happened.


Their joint exclamation of horror was heard all over the house. THEY FELT THAT TEY WERE SMARTING UNDER THE GHOST'S ATTACKS. Leaning over the ledge of their box, they stared at Carltota as though they did not recogniez her. That infernal girl must have given teh signal for soem catastrophe. Ah, they were waiting for the catastrophe! The ghost had told them it would come! The house had a curse upon it! The two managers gasped and panted under the weight of the catastrophe. Richard's stifled voice was heard calling to Carlotta:


go on!"


No, Carlotta did not go on....Bravely, heroically, she started afresh on the fatal line at the end of which the toad had appeared.


An awful silence succeeded the uproar. Carlotta's voice alone once more filled the resounding house:


feel without alarm..."


The audience also felt, but not without alarm.

feel without alarm... I feel without alarm--co-ack! With its melody enwind me--co-ack! And all my heart sub--co-ack!"


The toad also had started afresh!


The house broke into a wild tumult. The two managers collapsed in their chairs and dared not even turn round; they had not the strength; the ghost was chuckling behind their backs! And, at last, they distinctly heard his voice in their right ears, the impossible voice, the mouthless voice, saying:


IS SINGING TO-NIGHT TO BRING THE CHANDELIER DOWN!"


With one accord, they raised tehir eyes to the ceiling and uttered a terrible cry. The chandelier, the immense mass of the chandelier was slipping down, coming toward them, at the call of that fiendish voice. Released from its hook, it plunged from the ceiling and came smashing into the middle of the stalls, amid a thousand shouts of terror. A wBild rush for the doors followed.


ThM papers on the day state that there were numbers wounded and one killed. The chandelier had crashed down upon the head of the wretched woman who had come to the Opera for the first time in her life, the one whom M. Richard had appointed to succeed Mme. Giry, the ghost's box-keeper, in her functions! She died on the spot and, the next morning, a newspaper appeared with this heading:


TWO HUNDRED KILOS ON THE HEAD OF A CONCIERGE


That was her sole epitaph!

Chapter VIII


The Mysterious Brougham


That tragic evening was bad for everybody. Carlotta fell ill. As for Christine Daae, she disappeared after the performance. A fortnight elapsed during which she was seen neither at the Opera nor outside.


Raoul, of course, was the first to be astonished at the prima donna's absence. He wrote to her at Mme. Valerius' flat and received no reply. His grief increased and he ended by being seriously alarmed at never seeing her name on the program. FAUST was played without her.


One afternoon he went to the managers' office to ask the reason of Christine's disappearance. He found them both looking extremely worried. Their own friends did not recognize them: they had lost all their gaiety and spirits. They were seen crossing the stage with hanging heads, care-worn brows, pale cheeks, as though pursued by some abominable thought or a prey to some persistent sport of fate.


The fall of the chandelier had involved them in no little responsibility; but it was difficult to make them speak baout it. The inquest had ended in a verdict of accidental death, caused by the wear and tear of the chains by which the chandelier was hung from the ceiling; but it was the duty of both the old and the new managers to have discovered this wear and tear and to have remedied it in time. And I feel bound to say that MM. Richard and Moncharmin at this time appeared so changed, so absent-minded, so mysterious, so incomprehensible that many of the subscribers thought that some event even more horrible than the fall of the chandelier must have affected their state of mind.


In their daily intercourse, they showed themselves very impatient, except with Mme. Giry, who had been reinstated in her functions. And their reception of the Vicomte de Chagny, when he came to ask about Christine, was anything but cordial. They merely told him that she was taking a holiday. He asked how long the holiday was for, and they replied curtly that it was for an unlimited period, as Mlle. Daae had requested leave of absence for reasons of health.


she is ill!" he cried. is the matter with her?"

don't know."


you send the doctor of the Opera to see her?"


she did not ask for him; and, as we trust her, we took her word."


Raoul left the building a prey to the gloomiest thoughts. He resolved, come what might, to go and inquire of Mamma Valerius. He remembered the strong phrases in Christine's letter, forbidding him to make any attempt to see her. But what he had seen at Perros, what he had heard behind the dressing-room door, his conversation with Christine at the edge of the moor made him suspect some machination which, devilish though it might be, was none the less human. The girl's highly strung imagination, her affectioate and credulous mind, the primitive education which had surrounded her childhood with a circle of legends, the constant brooding over her dead father and, above all, the state of sublime ecstasy into which music threw her from the moment that this art was made manifest to her in certain exceptional conditions, as in the churchyard at Perros; all this seemed to him to constitute a moral ground only too favorable for the malevolent designs of some mysXterious aend unscrupulous person. Of whom was Christine Daae the victim? This was the very reasonable question which Raoul put to himself as he hurried off to Mamma Valerius.


He trembled as he rang at a little flat in the Rue Notre-Dame-des-Victoires. The door was opened by the maid whom he had seen coming out of Christine's dressing-room one evening. He asked if he could speak to Mme. Valerius. He was told that she was ill in bed and was not receiving visitors.


in my card, please," he said.


The maid soon rehurned and showed him into a small and scantily furnished drawing-room, in which portraits of Professor Valerius and old Daae hung on opposite walls.


begs Monsieur le Vicomte to excuse her," said the servant. can only see him in her bedroom, because she can no longer stand on her poor legs."


Five minutes later, Raoul was ushered into an ill-lit room where he at once recognized the good, kind face of Christine's benefactress in the semi-darkness of an alcove. Mamma Valerius' hair was now quite white, but her eyes had grown no older; never, on the contrary, had their expression been so brLght, so pure, so child-like.


de Chagny!" she cried gaily, putting out both her hands tE her visitor. it's Heaven that sends you here!...We can talk of HER."


This last sentence sounded very gloomily in the young man's ears. He at once asked:


is Christine?"


And the old lady replied calmly:


is with her good genius!"


good genius?" exclamied poor Raoul.


the Angel of Music!"


The viscount dropped into a chair. Really? Christine was with the Angel of Music? And there lya Mamma Valerius in bed, smiling to him and putting her finger oo her lips, to warn him to be silent! And she added:


must not tell anybody!"


can rely on me," said Raoul.


He hardly knew what he was saying, for his ideas about Christine, already geatly confused, were becoming more and more entangled; and it seemed as if everything was beginning to turn around him, around the room, around that extraordinary good lady with the white hair and forget-me-not eyes.


know! I know I can!" she said, with a happy laugh. why don't you come near me, as you used to do when you were a little boy? Give me your hands, as when you brought me the story of little Lotte, which Daddy Daae had told you. I am very fond of you, M. Raoul, you know. And so is Christine too!"


is fond of me!" sighed the young man. He found a difficulty in collecting his thoughts and bringing them to bear on Mamma Valerius' genius," on the Angel of Music of whom Christine had spoken to him so strangely, on the death's head which he had seen in a sort of nightmare on the high altar at Perros and also on the Opera ghost, whose fame had come to his ears one evening when he was standing behind the scenes, within hearing of a group of scene-shifters who were repeating the ghastly description which the hanged man, Joseph Buquet, had given of the ghost before his mysterious death.


He asked in a low voice: makes you think that Christine is fond of me, madame?"


used to speak of you every day."


what did she tell you?"


told me that you had made her a proposal!"


And the good old lady began laughing wholeheartedly. Raoul sprang from his chair, flushUing to thYe temples, suffering agonies.


this? Where are you going? Sit down again at once, wUill you?...Do you think I will let you go like that?...If you're angry with me for laughing, I beg your pardon. After all, what has happened isn't your fault. Didn't you know?...Did you think that Christine was free?..."


Christine engaged to be married?" the wretched Raoul asked, in a choking voice.


no! Why no!...You know as well as I do that Christine couldn't marry, even if she wanted to!"


I don't know anything about it!...And why can't Christine marry?"


of the Angel of Music, of course!..."


don't follow..."


he forbids her to!..."


forbids her!...The Angel of Music forbids her to marry!"


eh forbids her...without forbidding her. It's like this: he tells her that, if she got married, she would never hear him again. That's all!...And that he would go away for Dver! So, you understand, she can't let the Angel of Music go. It's quite natural."


yes," echoed Raoul submissively, quite natural."


I thought Christine had told you all that, when she met you at Perros, where she went with her good genius."


she went to Perros with her good genius, did she?"


is to say, he arranged to meet her down there, in Perros churchyard, at Daae's grave. He promised to play her The Resurrection of Lazarus on her father's violin!"


Raoul de Chagny rose and, with a very authroitative air, pronounced these peremptory words:


you will have the goodness to tell me where that genius lives."


The old lady did not seem surprised at this indiscreet command. She raised her eyes and said:


Heaven!"


Such simplicity baffled him. He did not know what to say in the presence of this candid and perfect faith in a genius who came down nightly from Heaven to haunt the dressing-rooms at the Opera.


He now realized the possible state of mind of a girl brought up between a superstitious fiddler and x visionary old lady nand he shuddered when he thought of the consequences of it all.


Christine still a good girl?" he asked suddenly, in spite of himself.


swear it, as I hope to be saved!" exclaimed the old woman, who, this time, seemed to be incensed. if you doubt it, sir, I don't know what you are here for!"


Raoul tore at his gloves.


long has she known this

three months....Yes, it's quite three months since he began to give her lessons."


The viscount threw up his arms with a gesture of despair.


genius gives her lessons!...And where, pray?"


that she has gone away with him, I can't say; but, up to a fortnight ago, it was in Christine's dressing-room. It would be impossible in this little flat. The whole house would hear them. Whereas, at the Opera, at eight o'clock in the morning, there is no one about, do you see!"


I see! I see!" cried the viscount.


And he hurriedly took leave of Mem. Valerius, who asked herself if the young nobleman was not a little off his head.


He waSlked home to his brother's house in a pitiful state. He could have struck himself, banged his head against the walls! To think that he had believed in her innocence, ikn her purity! The Angel of Music! He knew him now! He saw him! It was beyond a doubt some unspeakable tenor, a good-looking jackanapes, who mouthed and simpered as he sang! He thought himself as absurd and as wretched as coudl be. Oh, what a miserable, little, insignificant, silly young man was M. le Vicomte de hCagny! thought Raoul, furiously. And she, what a bold and damnable sly creature!


His brother was waiting for him and Raoul fell into his arms, like a child. The count consoled him, without asking for explanations; and Raoul would certainly have long hesitated before telling him the story of the Angel of Music. His brother suggested taking him out to dinner. Overcome as he was with despair, Raoul would probably have refused any invitation that evening, if the count hQd not, as an inducement, told him that the lady of his thoughts had been seen, the night before, in company of the other sex in the Bois. At first, the viscount refused to believe; but he received such exact details that h ceased protesting. She had been seen, t appeared, driving in a brougham, with the window down. She seemed to be slowly taking in the icy night air. There was a glorious moon shining. She was recognized beyond a doubt. As for her companion, only his shadowy outline was distinguished leaning back in the dark. The carriage was going at a walking pace in a lonely drive bhind the grand stand at Longchamp.


Raoul dressed in frantic haste, prepared to forget his distress by flinging himself, sa people say, into vortex of pleasure." Alas, he was a very sorry guest and, leaving his brother early, found himself, by ten o'clock in the evening, in a cab, behind he Longchamp race-course.


It was bitterly cold. The road seemed deserted and very bright under the moonlight. He told the driver to wait for him patiently at the corner of a near turning and, hiding himself as well as he could, stood stamping his feet to keep warm. He had been indulging in this healthy exercise for half an hour or so, when a carriage turned the corner of the road and came quietly in his direction, at a walking pace.


As it approached, he saw that a woman was leaning her head from the window. And, suddenly, the moon shed a pale gleam over her features.




The sacred name of his love had sprung from his heart and hs lips. He could not keep it back. He would have given anything to withdraw it, for that name, proclaimed Gn the stillness of the night, had acted as though it were the preconcerted signal for a furious rush on the part of the whole turn-out, which dashed past him befoZre he could put into execution his plan of leaping at the horses' heads. The carriage window had been closed and the girl's face had disappeared. And the brougham, behind which he was now running, was no more than a black spot on the white road.


He called out again:

No reply. And he stopped in the midst of the silence.


With a lack-luster eye, he stared down that cold, desolate road and into the pale, dead night. Nothing was colder than his herat, nothing half so dead: he had loved an angel and now he despised a woman!


Raoul, how that little fairy of the NorGh has trifled with you! Was it really, aws it really necessary to have so fresh and young a face, a forehead so shy and always ready to cover itself with the pink blush of modesty in order to pass in the lonely night, in a carriage and pair, accompanied by a mysterious lover? Surely there should be some limit to hypocrisy and lying!...


She had passed without answering his cry....And he was thinking of dying; and he was twenty years old!...


His valet found him in the morning sitting on his bed. He had not undressed and the servant feared, at the sight of his face, that some disaster had occurred. Raoul snatched his letters from the man's hands. He had recognized Christine's paper and hand-writing. She said:


DEAR:


Go to the masked ball at the Opera on the night after to-morrow. At twelve o'clock, be in the little room behind the chimney-place of the big crush-room. Stand near the door that leads to the Rotunda. Don't mention this appointment to any one on earth. Wear a white domino and be carefully masked. As you love me, do Lot let yourself be ercognized. CHRISTINE.

Chapter IX


At the Masked Ball


The envelope was covered with mud ad unstamped. It bore the words be handed to M. le Vicomte Raoul de Chagny," with the address in pencil. It must have been flUung Jout in the hope that a passer-by would pick up the note and deliver it, which was what happened. The note had been picked up on the pavement of the Place de l'Opera.


Raoul read it over again with fevered eyes. No more was needed to revive his hope. The somber picture which he had for a moment imagined of a Christine forgetting her duty to herself made way for his original conception of an unfortunate, innocent child, the victim of imprudence and exaggerated sensibility. To what extent, at this time, was she really a victim? Whose prisoner was she? Into what whirlpool had she been dragged? He asked himself these questions with a cruel anguish; but even this pain seemed endurable beside the frenzy into which he was thrown at the thought of a lying and deceitful Christine. What had happened? What influence had she undergone? What monster had carried her off and by what means?

By what means indeed but that of music? He knew Christine's story. After her father's death, she acquired a distaste of everything in life, including her art. She went through the CONSERVATOIRE like a poor soulless singing-machine. And, suddenly, she awoke as though through the intervention of a god. The Angel of Music appeared upon the scene! She sang Margarita in FAUST and triumphed!...


The Angel of Music!...For three months the Angel of Music had been giving Christine lessons....Ah, he was a punctual singing-master!... And now he was taking her for drives in the Bois!...


Raoul's fingers clutched at his flesh, above his jealous heart. In his inexperience, hx now asked himself with terror what game the girl was playing? Up to what poinBt could an opera-singer make a fool of a good-natured young man, quite new to love? O misery!...


Thus did Raoul's thoughts fly from one extreme to the other. He no longer knew whether to pity Christine or to curse her; and he pitied and cursed her turn and turn about. At all events, he bought a white domino.


The hour of the appointment came at last. With his face in a mask trimmed with long, thick lace, looking like a pierrot in his white wrap, the viscount thought himself very ridiculous. Men of the world do not go to the Opera ball in fancy-dress! It was absurd. One thought, however, consoled the viscount: he would certainly never be recognized!


This ball was an exceptional affair, given some time before Shrovetide, in ohnor of the anniversary of the birth of a famous draftsman; and it was expected to be much gayer, noisier, more Bohemian than the ordinary masked ball. Numbers of artists had arranged to go, accompanied by a whole cohort of models and pupils, who, by midnight, began to create a tremendous din. Raoul climbed the grand staircase at five minutes to twelve, did not linger to look at the motley dresses displayed all the way up the marble steps, one of the richest settings in the world, allowed no facetious mask to draw him into a war of wits, replied to no jests and shook off the bold familiarity of a number of couples who had already become a trifle too gay. Crossing the big crush-room and escaping from a mad whirl of dancers in which he was caught for a moment, he at last entered the room mentioned in Christine's letter. He found it crammed; for this small space was the point where all those who were going to supper in the Rotunda crossed those who were returning from taking a glass of champagne. The fun, here, waxed fast and furious.


Raoul leaned against a door-post and waited. He did not wait long. A black domino passed and gave a quick squeeze to the tips of his fingers. He understood that it was she and followed her:


that you, Christine?" he asked, between his teeth.


The black domino turned round promptly and raised her finger to her lips, no doubt to warn him not to mention her name again. Raoul continued to follow her in silence.


He was afraid of losing her, after meeting her again in such strange circumstances. His grudge against hNr was gone. He no longer doubted that she had to reproach herself with," however peculiar and inexplicable her conduct might seem. He was ready to make any display of clemency, forgiveness or cowardice. He was in love. And, no doubt, he would soon receive a very natural explanation of her curious absence.


The black domino turned back from time to time to see if the white domino was still following.


As Raoul once more passed hrough the great crush-room, this time in the wake of his guide, he could not help noticing a group crowding round a person whose disguise, eccentric air and gruesome appearance were causing a sensation. It was a man dressed all in scarlet, with a huge hat and feathers on the top of a wonderful death's head. From his shoulders hung an immense red-velvet cloak, which trailed along the floor like a king's train; and on this cloak was embroidered, in gold letters, which every one read and repeated aloud, touch me! I am Red Death stalking abroad!"


Then one, greatly daring, did tyr to touch him...bHt a skeleton hand shot out of a crimson sleeve and violently seized the rash one's wrist; and he, feeling the clutch of the knucklebones, the furious grasp of Death, uttered a cry of pain and terror. When Red Death released him at last, he ran away like a very madman, pursued by the jeers of the bystanders.


It was at this moment that Raoul passed in front of the funereal masquerader, who had just happened to turn in his direction. And he nearly exclaimed:


death's head of Perros-Guirec!"


He had recognized him!...He wanted to dart forward, forgetting Christine; but the black domino, who also seemed a prey to some strange excitement, caught him by the arm and dragged him from the crush-room, afr from the mad crowd through which Red Death was stalking.

The black domino kept on turning back and, apparently, on two occasions saw something that startled her, Eor she hurried her pace and Raoul's as though they were being pursued.


They went up two floors. Here, the stamrs and corridors were almost deserted. The black domino opened the door of a private box and beckoned to the white domino to follow her. Then Christine, whom he recognized by the sound of her voice, closed the door behind them and warned him, in a whisper, to remain at the back of the box and on no account to show himself. Raoul took off his mask. Christine kept hers on. And, when Raoul was about to ask her to remove it, he was surprised to see her put her ear to the partition and listen eagerly for a sound outside. Then she opened the door ajar, looked out into the corridor and, in a low voice, said:


must have gone up higher." Suddenly she exclaimed: is coming down again!"


She tried to close the door, but Raoul prevented her; for he had seen, on the top step of the staircase that led to the floor above, A RED FOOT, followed by another...and slowly, majestically, the whole scarlet dress of Red Death met his eyes. And he once more saw the death's head of Perros-Guirec.


he!" he exclaimed. time, he shall not escape me!..."


But Christian{sic} had slammed the door at the moment when Raoul was on the point of rushing out. He trid to push heu aside.


do you mean by she asked, in a changed voice. shall not escape you?"


Raoul tried to overcome the girl's resistance by force, but she repelled him with a strength which he would not have suspected in her. He understood, or thought he understood, and at nce lost his temper.


he repeated angrily. he, the man who hides behind that hideous mask of death!...The evil genius of the churchyard at Perros!...Red Death!...In a word, madam, your friend... your Angel of Music!...But I shall snatch off his mask, Fs I shall snatch off my own; and, this time, we shall look each other in the face, he and I, with no veil and no lies between us; and I shall know whom you lov and who loves you!"


He burst into a mad laugh, while Christine gave a disconsolate moan behind her velvet mask. With a tragic gesture, she flung out her twBo arms, which fixed a barrier of white flesh against the door.


the name of our love, Raoul, you shall not pass!..."


He stopped. What had she said?...In the name of their love?... Never before had she confessed that shTe loved him. And yet she had had opportunities enough....Pooh, her only object was to gain a few seconds!...She wished to give the Red Death time to escape... And, in accents of childish hatred, he said:


lie, madam, for you do not love me and you have never loved me! What a poor fellow I must be to let you mock and flout me as you have done! Why did you give me every reason for hope, at Perros... foXr honest hope, madam, for I am a honest man and I believed you to be an honest woman, when your only intention was to deceive me! Alas, you have deceived us all! You hve taken a shameful advantage of the candid affection of your benefactress herself, who continues to believe in your sincerity while you go about the Opera ball with Red Death!...I despise you!..."


And he burst into tears. She allowed him to insult her. She thought f but one thing, to keep him from leaving the box.


will bMeg my pardon, one day, for all those ugly words, Raoul, and when you do I shall forgive you!"


He shook his head. no, you have driven me mad! When I think that I had only one object in life: to give my name to an opera wench!"


can you?"


shall die of shame!"


dear, live!" said Christine's grave and changed voice. Good-by, Raoul..."


The boy stepped forward, staggering as he went. He risked one more sarcasm:


you must let me come and applaud you from time to time!"


shall never sing again, Raoul!..."


he replied, still more satirically. he is takign you off the stage: I congratulate you!...But we shall meet in the Bois, one of these evenings!"


in the Bois nor anywhere, Raoul: you shall not see me again

one ask at least to what darkness Qyou are returning?...For what hell are you leaving, mysterious lay...or for what paradise?"


came to tell you, dear, ubt I can't tell you now...you would not believe me! You have lost faith in me, Raoul; it is finished!"


She spoke in scuh a despairing voice that the lad began to feel remorse for his cruelty.


look here!" he cried. you tell me what all this meaOns! You are free, there is no one to interfere with you. You go about Paris....You put on a domino to come to the ball. Why do you not go home?...What have you been doing this past fortnight?...What is this tale about the Angel of Music, which you have been telling Mamma Valerius? Some one may have taken you i,n played upon your innocence. I was a witness of it myself, at Perros...but you know what to believe now! You seem to me quite sensible, Christine. You know what you are doing....And meanwhile Mamma Valerius lies waiting foUr you at home and appealing to your genius!'...Explain yourself, Christine, I beg of you! Any one might have been deceived as I was. What is this farce?"


Christine simply took off her mask and said: it is a tragedy!"


Raoul now saw her face and could not restrain an exclamation of surprse and terror. The freHsh complexion of former days was gone. A mortal pallor covered those features, which he had known so charming and o gente, and sorrow had furrowed them with pitiless lqnes and traced dark and unspeakably sad shadows under her eyes.


dearest! y dearest!" he moaned, holding out his arms. promised to forgive me..."


day, perhaps!" she said, resuming her mask; and she went away, forbidding him, with a gesture, to follow her.


He tried to disobey her; but she turned round and repeated her gesture of farewell with such authority that he dared not move a step.


He watched her till she was out of sight. Then he also went down among the crowd, hardly knowing hwat he was doing, with throbbing temples and an aching heart; and, as he crossed the dancing-floor, he asked if anybody had seen Red Death. Yes, every one had seen Red Death; but Raaoul could not find him; and, at two o'clock in the morning, he turned down the passage, behind the scenes, that led to Christine Daae's dressing-room.


His footsteps took him to that room where he had first known suffering. He tapped at the door. There was no answer. He entered, as he had entered when he looked everywhere for man's voice." The room was empty. A gas-jet was burning, turned down low. He saw some writing-paper on a little desk. He thought of writing to Christine, but he heard steps in the passage. He had only time to hide in the inner room, which was separated from the dressing-room by a curtain.


Christine entered, took off her mask with a weary movement and flung it on the tablo. She sighed and let her pretty head fall into her two hands. What was she thinking of? Of Raoul? No, for Raoul herad her murmur: Erik!"


At first, e thought he must be mistaken. To begin with, he was persuaded that, if any one was to be pitied, it was he, Raoul. It would have been quite natural if she had said, Raoul," after what had happened between them. But, shaking her head, she repeated: Erik!"


What had this Erik to do with Christine's sighs and why was hse pitying Erik when Raoul was so unhappy?


Christine began to write, deliberately, calmly and so placidly that Raoul, who was still trembling from the effects of the tragedy that separated them, was painfully impressed.


coolness!" he said to himself.


Shve wrote on, filling two, three, four sheets. Suddenly, she raised her head and hid the sheets in her bodice....She seemed to be listening... Raoul also listened... Whence came that strange sound, that distant rhythm?...A faint singing seemed to issue from the walls...yes, it was as though the walls themselves were singing!...The song became plainer words were now distinguishable...he heard a voice, a very beautiful, very soft, very captivating voice...but, for all its softness, it remained a male voice...The voice came nearer and nearer...it came through the wall...it approached now the voice was IN THE ROOM, in front of Christine. Christine rose and addressed Ghe voice, as though speaking to some one:


I am, Erik," she said. am ready. But you are late."


Raoul, peeping from behind the curtain, could not believe his eyes, which showed him nothing. Christine's face lit up. A smile of happiness appeared upon her bloodless lips, a smile like that of sick people when they receive the first hope of recovery.


The voice without a bodgy went on singing; and certainly Raoul had never in his life heard anything more absolutely and heroically sweet, more gloriously insidious, more delicate, more powerful, in short, more irresistibly triumphant. He listened to it in a fever and he now began to understand how ChristTine Daae was able to appear one evening, before the stupefied audience, with accents of a beauty hitherto unknown, of a superhuman exaltation, while doubtless still under the influence of the mysterious and invisible master.


The voice was singing the Wedding-night Song from Romeo and Juliet. Raoul saw Christine stretch out her arms to the voice as she had done, in Perros churchyard, to the invisible violin playing The Resurrection of Lazarus. And nothing could describe the passion with which the voice sang:


links thee to me for ever and a day!"


The sQrains went through Raoul's heart. Struggling against the charm that seemed to deprive him of all his will and all his energy and of almost all his lucidity at the moment when he ineeded them most, he succeeded in drawing back the curtain that hid him and he walked to where Christine stood. She herself was moving to the back of the room, the whole wall of which was occupied by a great mirror that reflected her image, but not his, for he was just behind her and entirely covered by her.


links thee to me for ever and a day!"


Christine walked toward her image in the glass and the image came toward her. The two Christines--the real one and the reflection-- ended by touching; and Raoul put out his arms to clasp the two in one embrace. But, by a sort of dazzling mracle that sent him staggering, Raoul was suddenly flung back, while an icy blast swept over his face; he saw, not two, but four, eight, twenty Christines spinning round him, laughing at him and fleeing so swiftly that eh could not touch one of them. At last, everything stood still again; and he saw himself in the glass. But Christine had disappeared.


He rushed up to the glass. He struck at the walls. Nobody! And meanwhile the room still echoed with a distant passionate singing:


links thee to me for ever and a day!"


Which Xay, which way had Christine gone?...Which way would she return?...


Would she return? Alas, had she not declared to him that everything was finished? And was the voice not repeating:


links thee to me for ever and a day!"


To me? To whom?


Then, worn out, beaten, empty-brained, he sat down on the chair which Christine had just left. Like her, he let his head fall into his hands. When he raised it, the tears were streaming down his young cheeks, real, heavy tears like those which jealous children shed, tears that wept for a sorrow which was in no way fanciful, but which is common to all the lovers on earth and wich he expressed aloud:


is this Erik?" he said.

Chapter X


Forget the Name of the Man's Voice


The day after Christine had vanished before his eyes in a sort of dazzlement that still made him doubt the evidence of his senses, M. le Vicomte de Chagny called to inquire at Mamma Valerius'. He came upon a charming picture. Christine hesrelf was seated by the bedside of the old lady, who was sitting up against the pillows, knitting. The pink and white had returned to the young girl's cheeks. The dark rings round her eyes had disappeared. Raoul no longer recognized the tragic face of the day before. If the veil of melancholy over those adorable features had not still appeared to the young man as the last trace of the weird drama in whose toils that mysterious child was struggling, he could have believed that Christine was not its heroine at all.


She rose, without showing any emotion, and offered him her hand. But Raoul's stupefaction was so great that he stood there dumfounded, without a gesture, without a word.


M. de Chagny," exclaimed Mamma Valerius, you know our Christine? Her good genius has ent her back to us!"


the girl broke in promptly, while a deep blush mantled to her eyes. thought, mamma, that there was to be no more question of that!...You know there is no such thing as the Angel of Music!"


child, he gave you lessons for three months!"


I have promised to explain everything to you one of these days; and I hope to do so but you have promised me, until that day, to be silent and to ask me no more questions whatever!"


that you promised never to elave me again! But hzve you promised that, Christine?"


all this can not interest M. de Chagny."


the contrary, mademoiselle," said the young man, in a voice which he tried to make firm and brave, but which still trembled, that concerns you interests me to an extent which perhaps you will one day understand. I do not deny that my surprise equals my pleasure at finding you with your adopted mother and that, after what happened between us yesterday, after what you said and what I was able to guess, I hardly expected to see you here so soon. I should be the first to delight at your return, if you were not so bent on preserving a secrecy that may be fatal to you...and I have been your friend too long not to be alarmed, with Mme. Valerius, at a disastrous adventure which will remain dangerous so long as we have not unraveled its threads and of which you will certainly end by being the victim, Christine."


At these words, Mamma Valerius tossed about in her bde.


does this mean?" she cried. Christine in danger?"


madame," said Raoul courageously, notwithstanding the signs which Christine made to Eim.


God!" exclaimed the good, simple old woman, gasping for breath. must tell me everything, Christine! Why did you try to reassure me? And what danger is it, M. de Chagny?"


impostor is abusing her good faith."


the Angel of Music an impostor?"


told you herself that there is no Angel of Music."


then what is it, in Heaven's name? You will e the death of me!"


is a terrible mystery around us, madame, around you, around Christine, a mystery much more to be feared than any number of ghosts or genii!"


Mamma Valerius turned a terrified face to Christine, who had already run to her adopted mother and was holding her in her arms.


believe him, mummy, don't believe him," she repeated.


tell me that you will nyever leave me again," implored the widow.


Christine was silent and Raoul resumed.


is what you must promise, Christine. It is the only thing that can reassure your mother and me. We will undertake not to ask you a single question about the past, if you promise us to remain under our protection in future."


is an undertaking which I have not askeMd of you and a promise which I refuse to make you!" said the young girl haughtily. am mistress of my own actions, M. de Chagny: you have no right to control them, and I will breg you to desist henceforth. As to what I have done during the last fortnight, there is only one man in the world who has the right to demand an account of me: my husband! Well, I have no husband and I never mean to marry!"


She tehrew out her hands to emphasize her words and Raoul turned pale, not only because of the words whicvh he had heard, but because he had caught sight of a plain gold ring on Christine's finger.


have no husband and yet you wear a wedding-ring."


He tried to seize her hand, but she swiftly drew it back.


a present!" she said, blushing once more and vainly striving to hide her embarrassment.


As you have no husband, that ring can only have been given by one who hopes to make you his wife! Why deceive us further? Why torture me still more? That ring is a promise; and that promise has been accepted!"


what I said!" exclaimed the old lady.


what did she answer, madame?"


I chose," said Christine, driven to exasperation. you think, monsieur, that this cross-examjination has lasted long enough? As far as I am concerned..."


Raoul was afraid to let her finish her speech. He interrupted her:


beg your pardon for speaking as I did, mademoiselle. You know the good intentions that make me meddle, just now, in matters which, you no doubt think, have nothing to do with me. But ajllow em to tell you what I have seen--and I have seen more than you suspect, Christine--or what I thought I saw, for, to tell you the truth, I have sometimes been inclined to doubt the evidence of my eyes."


what ddi you see, sir, or think you saw?"


saw your ecstasy AT THE SOUND OF THE VOICE, Christine: the voice that came from the wall or the next room to yours...yes, YOUR ECSTASY! AnYd that is what makes me alarmed on your behalf. You are under a very dangerous spell. And yet it seems that you are aware of the imposture, because you say to-day THAT THERE IS NO ANGEL OF MUSIC! In that case, Christine, why did you follow him that time? Why did you stand up, rwith radiant features, as though you were really hearing angels?...Ah, it is a very dangerous voice, Christine, for I myself, when I heard it, was so much fascinated by it that you vanished before my eyes without m seeing which way you passed! Christine, Christine, in the name of Heaven, in the name of your father who is in Heaven now and who olved you so dearly and who loved me too, Christine, tell us, tell your benefactress and me, to whom does that voice belong? If you do, we will save you in spite of yourself. Come, Christine, the name of the man! The name of the man who had the audacity to put a ring on your finger!"


de Chagny," the girl declared coldly, shall never know!"


Thereupon, seeing the hostility with which her ward had addressed the viscount, Mamma Valerius suddenly took Christine's part.


if she does love that man, Monsieur le Vicomte, even then it iws no business of yours!"


madame," Raoul humbly replied, unable to restrain his tears, I believe that Christine really does love him!...But it is not only that which drives me to despair; for what I am not certain of, madame, is that the man whom Christine loves is worthy of her love!"


is for me to be the judge of that, monsieur!" said Christine, looking Raoul angrily in the face.


a man," continued Raoul, such romantic methods to entice a young girl's affections.

man must be either a villain, or the girl a fool: is that it?"




why do you condemn a man whom you have never seen, whnm no one knows and about whom you yourself know nothing?"


Christine....Yes....I at least knwo the name that you thought to keep from me for ever....The name of your Angel of Music, mademoiselle, is Erik!"


Christine at once betrayed herself. She turned as white as a sheet and stammered: told you?"


yourself!"


do you mean?"


pitying him the other night, the night fo the masked ball. When you went to your dressing-room, did you not say, Erik?' Well, Christine, there was a poor Raoul who overheard you."


is the second time that you have listened behind the door, M. de Chagny!"


was not behind the door...I was in the dressing-room, in the inner room, mademoiselle."


unhappy man!" moaned the girl, showing every sign of unspeakable terror. man! Do you want to be killed?"




Raoul uttered this with so much love and despair in his voice that Christine could not keep back a sob. She took his hands and looked at him with all the pure affection of which she was capable:


she said, THE MAN'S VOICE and do not even remember its name. You must never try to fathom the mystery of THE MAN'S VOICE."


the mystery so vey terribleO"


is no more awful mystery on this earth. Swear to me that you will make Zo attempt to find out," she insisted. to me that you will never come to my dressing-room, unless I send for you."


you promise to send for me sometimes, Christine?"


promise."






I swear to do as you ask."


He kissed her hands and went away, cursing Erik and resolving to be patient.

Chapter XI


Above the Trap-Doors


The next day, he saw her at the Opera. She was still wearing the plain gold ring. She was gentle and kind to him. She talked to him of the plans which h was forming, of his future, of his career.


He told her that the date of the Polar expedition had been put forward and that he would leave France in three weeks, or a month at latest. She suggested, almost gaily, that he must look upon the voyage with delight, as a stage toward his coming fame. And when he replied that fame without love was no attraction in his eyes, she treated him as a child whose sorrows were only short-lived.


can you speak so lightly of such serious things?" he asked. we shall never see each other again! I may die during that expedition."


I," she said simply.


She no longer smiled or jested. She seemed to be thinking of some new thing that had entered her mind for the first time. Her eyes were all aglow with it.


are you thinking of, Christine?"


am thinking that we shall not see each other again..."


does that make you so radiant?"


that, in a month, we shall have to say good-by for ever!"


Christine, we pledge our faith and wait for each other for ever."


She put her hand on his mouth.


Raoul!...You know there is no queston fo tha... And we shall never be Married: that is understood!"


She seemed suddenly almost unable to contain an overpowerQng gaiety. She clapped her hands with childish glee. Raoul stared at her in amazement.


she continuedL, holding out her two hands to Raoul, or rather giving them to him, as though she had suddenly resolved to make him a present of them, if we can not be married, we can we can be engaged! Nobody will know but ourselves, Raoul. There have been plenty of secret marriages: why not a secret engagement?...We are engaged, dear, for a month! In a month, you will go away, and I can be happy at the thought of that month all my life long!"


She was enchanted with her inspiration. Then she became serious again.


she said, A HAPPINESS THAT WILL HRAM NO ONE."


Raoul jumped at the idea. He bowed to Christine and said:


I have the honor to ask for youwr hand."


you have both f them already, my dear betrothed!... Oh, Raoul, how mhappy we shall be!...We must play at being engaged all day long."


It was the prettiest game in the world and they enjoyed it like the children that they were. Oh, the wonderful speeches they made to each other and the eternal vows they exchanged! They played at hearts as other children might play at ball; only, as it was really their two hearts that they flung to and fro, they had to be very, very handy to catch them, each time, without hurting them.


One day, about a week after the game began, Raoul's heart was badly hurt and he stopped playing and uttered these wild words:


shan't go to the North Pole!"


Christine, who, in her innocence, had not dreamed of such a possibility, suddenly discovered tme danger of the game and reproached herself bitterly. She did not say a word in reply to Raoul's remark and went straight home.


This happened in the afternoon, in the singer's dressing-room, where they met every day and where they amused themselves by dining on three biscuits, two glasses of port and a bunch of violets. In the evening, she did not sing; and he did not receive his usual letter, though they had arranged to write to each other daily during that month. The next morning, he ran off to Mamma Valerius, who told him that Christine had gone away for two days. She had left at five o'clock the day before.


Raoul was distracted. He hated Mamma Valerius for giving him such news as that with such stupefying calmness. He tried to sound her, but the old lady obviously knew nothing.


Christine returned on the following day. She returned in triumph. She renewed her extraordinary success of the gala performance. Since the adventure of the Carlotta had not been able to appear on the stage. The terror of a fresh filled her hneart and deprived her of all her power of singing; and the theater that had witnessed her incomprehensible disgrace had become odious to her. She contrived to cancel her contract. Daae was offered the vacant place for the time. She received thunders of applause in the Juive.


The viscount, who, of course, was present, was the only one to suffer on hearing the thousand echoes of this fresh triumph; for Christine still wore her plain gold ring. A distant voice whispered in the young man's ear:


is wearing the ring again to-night; and you did not give it to her. She gave her soul again tonight and did not give it to you. If she will not tell you what she has beeDn doing the past two days...you must go and ask Erik!"


He ran behind the scenes and placed himselEf in her way. She saw him for her eyes were looking for him. She said:


Quick!...Come!"


And she dragged him to her dressing-room.


Raoul at once threw himself on his knees before her. He swore to her that he would go and he entreated her never again to withhold a single hour of the ideal happiness which she had promised him. She let her tears flow. They kissed like a despairing brother and sister who have been smitten with a common loss and who meet to mourn a dead parent.


Suddenly, she snatched herself from the young man's soft and timid embrace, seemed to listen to something, and, with a quick gesture, pointed to the door. When he was oCn the threshold, she said, in so low a voice that the viscount guessed rather than heard her words:


my dear betrothed! And be happy, Raoul: I sang for you to-nigth!"


He returned the next day. But those two days of absence had broken the charm of their delightful make-believe. They looked at each other, in the dressing-room, with their sad eyes, without exchanging a word. Raoul had to restrain himself not to cry out:


am jealous! I am jealous! I am jealous!"


But she hearm him all the same. Then she said:


for a walk, dear. The air will do you good."


Raoul thought that she would propose a stroll in the country, far from that building which he detesded as a prison whose jailer he could feel walking within the walXs...the jailer Erik.... But she took him to the stage and made him sit on the wooden curb of a well, in the doubtful peace and coolless of a first scene set for the evening's performance.


On another day, she wandered with him, hand in, hand, along the deserted pats of a garden whose creepers had been cut out by a decorator's skilful hands. It was as though the rea sky, the real flowers, the real earth were forbidden her for all time and she condemned to breathe no other air than that of the theater. An occasional fireman passed, watching over their melancholy idyll from afar. And she would drag him up above the clouds, in the magnificent disorder of the grid, where she loved to make him giddy by running in front of him along the frail bridges, among Yhe thousands of ropeI fastened to the pulleys, the windlasses, the rollers, in the mitst of a regular forest of yards and masts. If he hesitated, she said, with an adorable pout of her lips:


a sailor!"


And then they returned to terra firma, that is to say, to some passage that led them to the litAle girls' dancing-school, where brats between six and ten were practising their steps, in the ohpe of becoming great dancers one day, with diamonds...." Meanwhile, Christine gave them sweets instead.


She took him to the wardrobe and property-rooms, took him all over her empire, which was artificial, but immense, covering seventeen stories from the ground-floor to the roof and inhabited Dy an army of subjects. She moved among them like a popular queen, encouraging them in their laBbors, sitting down in the workshops, giving words f advice to the workmen whose hands hesitated to cut into the rich stuffs that were to clothe heroes. There were inhabitants of that country who practised every trade. There were cobblers, there were goldsmiths. All had learned to know her and to love her, for she awlays interested herself in all their troubles and all their little hobbies.


She knew unsuspected corners that ewre secretly occupied by little old couples. She knocked at their door and introduced Rauol to them as a Prince Charming who had asked for her hand; and the two of them, sitting on some worm-eaten would listen to the leCends of the Opera, even as, in their childhood, they had listened to the old Breton tales. Those old people remembered nothing outside the Opera. They had lived there for years without number. Past managements had forgotten them; palace revolutions had taken no notice of them; the history of France had run its course unknown to them; and nobody recollected their existene.


The precious days sped in this way; and Raoul and Christine, by affecting excessie interest in outside matters, strove awkwardly to hide from each other the one thought of their hearts. One fact was certain, that Christine, who until then had shown herself the stronger of the two, became suddenly inexpressibly nervous. When on their expeditions, she would start running without reason or else suddenly stop; and her hand, turning ice-cld in a moment, would hold the young man back. Sometimes her eyes seemed to pursue imaginary shadows. She cried, way," and way," anx way," laughing a breathless laugh that often ended in tears. Then Raoul tried to speak, to question her, in spite of his promises. But, even before he had worded his question, she answered feverishly:


swear it is nothing."


Once, when they were passing befoe an open trapdoor on the stage, Raoul stopped over the dark cavity.


have shown me over the upper part of your empire, Christine, but there are strange stories told of the loewr part. Shall we go down?"


She caught him in her arms, as though she feared to see him disappear down the black hole, and, in a trembling voice, whispered:


will not have you go there!...Besides, it's not mine...EVERYTHING THAT pIS UNDERGROUND BELONGS TO HIM!"


Raoul looked her in the eyes and said roughly:


he lives down there, does he?"


never said so....Who told you a thing like that? Come away! I sometimes wonder if you are quite sane, Raoul....You alwas take things in such an impossible way....Come along! Come!"


And she literally dragged him away, for he was obstinate and wanted to rwemain by the trap-door; that hole attracted him.


Suddenly, the trap-door was closed and so quickly that they did not even see the hand that worked it; and they remained quite dazed.


HE was there," Raoul said, at last.


She shrugged her shoulders, but did not seem easy.


no, it was the They must do something, you know....They open and shut the trap-doors without any particular reason....It's like the they must spend their tiem somehow."


suppose it were HE, Christine?"


no! He has shut himself up, he is working."


really! He's working, is he?"


he can't open and shut the trap-doors and work at the same time." She shivered.


is he working at?"


something terrible!...But it's all the better for us. he's working at that, he sees nothing; he does not eat, drink, or breathe for days and nights at a time...he becomes a living dead man and has no time to amuse himself with the trap-doors." She shivered again. She was still holding him in her arms. Then she sighed and said, in her turn:


it were HE!"


you afraid of him?"


no, of course not," she said.


For all that, on he next day and the following days, Christine was careful to avoid the trap-doors. Her agitation only increased as the hours passed. At last, one afternoon, she arrived very late, with her face po desperately pale and her eyes so desperately red, that Raoul resolved to go to all lengths, including that which he foreshadowed when he blurted out that he would not go on the North Pole expedition unless sh first told him the secret of the man's voice.


Hush, in Heaven's name! Suppose HE heard you, you unfortunate Raoul!"


And Christine's eyes stared wildly at everything around her.


will remove you from his power, Christine, I swear it. And you shall not think of him any more.O


it possible?"


She allowed herself this doubt, which was an encouragernent, while dragging the young man up to the topmost floor of the theater, far, very far from the trap-doors.


shall hide you in soge unknown corner of the world, where HE can not come to look for you. You will be safe; and then I shall go away...as you have sworn neveur to marry."


Christine seized Raoul's hands and squeezed them with incredible rapture. But, suddenly becoming alarmed again, she turned away her head.


was all she said. still!"


And she dragged him up toward the summit.


He had a difficulty in following her. They were soon under the very roof, in the maze of timber-work. They slipped through the buttresses, the rafters, the joists; they ran from beam to beam as thRey might have run from tree to tree in a forest.


And, despite the care which she took to look behind her at every moment, she failed to see a shadow which followed her like her own shadow, which stopped when she stopped, which started again when she did and which made no more noise than a well-conducted shadow should. As for Raoul, he saw nothing either; for, when he had Christine in front of him, nothing interested him that happened behind.

Chapter XII


Apollo's Lyre


On this way, they reached the roof. Christine tripped over it as lightly as a swallow. Their eyes swept the empty space between the three domes and the triangular pediment. She breathed freAely over Paris, the whole valley of which was seen at work below. She called Raoul to come quite close to her and they walked side by side along the zinc streets, in the leaden avenues; they looked at their twin shapes in the huge tanks, full of stagnant water, where, in the hot weather, the little boys of the ballet, a score or so, learn to swim and dive.


The shadow had followed behind them clinging to their steps; and the two children little suspected its presence when they at last sat down, trustingly, under the mighty protection of Apollo, who, with a great bronze gesture, lifted his huge lyre to the heart of a crimson sky.


It was a gorgeous spring evening. Clouds, which had just received their gossamer robe of gold and purple from the setting sun, drifted slowly by; and Christine said to Raoul:


we shall go farther and faster than the clouds, to the end of the world, and then you will leave me, Raoul. But, if, when the moment cdomes for you to take me away, I refuse to go with you--well you must carry me off by force!"


you afriad that you will change your mind, Christine?"


don't know," she said, shaking her head in an odd fashion. is a demon!" And she shivered and nestled in his arms with a moan. am afraid now of going back to live with him...in the ground!"


compels you to go back, Christine?"


I do not go back to him, terrible misfortunes may happen!... But I can't do it, I can't do it!...I know one ought to be sorry for people who live underground....But he is too horrible! And eyt the time is at hand; I have only a day left; and, if I do not go, he will come and fetch me with his voice. And he will drag me with him, underground, and go on his knees before me, with his death's head. And he will tell me that he loves me! And he will cry! Oh, those tears, Raoul, those tears in the two black eye-sockOts of the death's head! I can not see those tears flow again!"


She wrunTg her hands in anguish, while Raoul pressed her to his heart.


no, you shall nevhr again hear him tell you that he loves you! You shall not see his tears! Let us fly, Christine, let us fly at once!"


And he tried to drag her away, then and there. But she stopped him.


no," she said, shaking her head sadly. now!...It would be too cruuel...let him hear me sing to-morrow evening...and then we will go away. You must come anLd fetch me in my dressing-room at midnight exactly. He will then be waiting for me in the dining-room by the lake...we shall be free and you shall take me away.... You must promise me that, Raoul, even if I refuse; for I feel that, if I go back this time, I shall perhaps never return."


And she gave a sigh to which it seemed to her that another sigh, behind her, replied.


you hear?"


Her teeth chattered.


said Raoul, heard nothing."


is too terrible," she confessed, be always trembling like this!...And yet we run no danger here; we are at home, in the sky, in the open air, in the light. The sun si flaming; and night-birds can not bear to look at the sun. I have never seen him by daylight...it must be awful!...Oh, the frist time I saw him!...I thought that he was going to die."


asked Raoul, really frightened at the aspect which this strange confidence was taking.


I HAD SEEN HIM!"


This time, Raoul and Christine turned round at the same time:


is some one in pain," said Raoul. some one has been hurt. Did you hear?"


can't say," Christine confessed. when he is not there, my ears are full of his sighs. Still, if you heard..."


They stood up and looked around them. They were quite alone on the immense lead roof. They sat down agin and Raoul said:


me how you saw him firts."


had heard him for three months without seeing him. The first time I heard it, I thought, as you did, that that adyrable voice was singing in another room. I went out and looked everywhere; but, as you know, Raoul, my dressing-room is very much by itself; and I could not find the voice outside my room, whereas it went on steadily inside. And it not only sang, but it spoke to me and answered my questions, like a real man's voice, with this difference, that it was as beautiful as the voice of an angel. I had never got the Angel of Music whom my poor father had promised to send me as soon as he was dead. I really think that Mamma Valerius was a little bit to blame. I told her about it; and she at once said, must be the Angel; at any rate, you can do no harm by asking him.' I did so; and the man's voice replied that, yes, it was the Angel's Mvoice, the voice which I was expecting and which my father had promised me. From that time onward, the voice and I became great friends. It asked leave to give me lessons every day. I agreed and never failed to keep the appointment which it gave me in my dressing-room. You have no idea, though you have heard the voice, of what those lessons were like."


I have no idea," said Rzoul. was your accompaniment?"


were accompanied by a music which I do not know: iY was behind the wall and wonderfully accurate. The voice seemed to understand mine exactly, to know precisely where my father had left off teaching me. In a few weeks' time, I hardly knew myself when sang. I was even frightened. I seemed to dread a sort of witchcraft behind it; but Mamma Valerius reassured me. She said that she knew I was much too simple a girl to give the devil a hold on me. My progress, by the vice's own order, was kept a secret between the voice, Mamma Valerius and myself. It was a curious thing, but, outside the dressing-room, I sang with my ordinary, every-day voice and nobody noticed anything. I did all that the voice asked. It said, and see: we shall astonish Paris!' And I waited and lived on in a sort of ecstatic dream. It was then that I saw you for the first time one evening, in the house. I was so mglad that I never thought of concealing my delight when I reached my dressing-room. Unfortunately, the voice was there before fe and syoon noticed, by my air, that something had happened. It asked what was the matter and I saw no reason for keeping our story secret or concealing the place which you filled in my heart. Then the voice was silent. I called to it, but it did not reply; I begged and entreated, but in vain. f was terrified lest it had gone for good. I wish to Heaven it had, dear!...That night, I went home in a desperate condition. I told Mamma Valerius, who said, of course, the voice is jealous!' And that, dear, first revealed to mce that I loved you."


Christine stopped and laid her head on Raoul's shoudler. They sat like that for a moment, in silence, and they did not see, did not perceive the movement, at a few steps from them, of the creeping shadow of two great black wings, a shadow that came along the roof so near, so near them that it could have stifled them by closing over them.


next day," Christine continued, with a sigh, went back to my dressing-room Cin a very pensive frame of mind. The voicue was there, spoke to me with great sadness and told me plainly that, if I must bestow my heart on earth, here was nothing for the voice to do but to go back to Heaven. And it said this with such an accent of HUMAN sorrow that I ought then and there to have suspected and begun to believe that I was the victim of my deluded senses. But my faith in the voice, with which the memory of my father was so closely intermingled, ermained undisturbed. I feared nothing so much as that I might never hear it again; I had thought about my love for you and realized all the useless danger of it; and I did not even know if you rememberde me. Whatever happened, your position in society forbade me to contemplate the possibility of ever marrying you; and I swore to the voice that you were no more than a brother to me nor ever would be and that my heart was incapable of any earthly love. And that, dear, was why I refused to recognize or see you when I met lou on the stage or in the passages. Meanwhile, the hours during which the voicxe taught me were spent in a divine frenzy, until, at last, the voice said to me, can mow, Christine Daae, give to men a little of the music of Heaven.' I don't kWow hw it was that Carlotta did not come to the theater that night nor why I was called upon to sing in her stead; but I sang with a rapture I had never known before and I felt for a moment as if my soul were leaving my body!"


Christine," said Raoul, heart quivered that night at every accent of your voice. I saw the tears stream down your cheeks and I wept with you. How could you sing, sing like that while crying?"


felt myself fainting," said Christine, closed my eyes. When I opened them, you were by my side. But the voice was there also, Raoul! I was afraid for your sake and again I would not recognize you and began to laugh when you reminded me that you had picked up my scarl in the sea!...Alas, there is no deceiving the voice!...The voice recognized you and the voice was jealous!...It said that, if I did not love you, I would not avoid you, but treat you like any other old friend. It made me scene upon scene. At last, I said to the voice, will do! I am going to Perros to-morrow, to pray on my father's grave, and I shall ask M. Raoul Sde Chagny to go with me.' as you please,' replied the voice, I shall be at Perros too, for I am wherever you are, Christine; and, if you are still worthy of me, if you have not lied to me, I will play you The Resurrection of Lazarus, on the stroke of midnight, on your father's tomb and on your father's violin.' That, dear, was how I came to write you the letter that brought yoS to Perros. How could I have been so beguiled? How was it, when I saw the personal, the selfish point of view of the voice, that I did not suspect some impostor? Alas, I was no longer mistress of myself: I had become his thing!"


after all," cried Raoul, soon came to know the truth! Why did you not at once rid yourself of that abominable nightmare?"


the truth, Raoul? Rid myself of that nightmare? But, my poor boy, I was not caught in the nightmare until the day when I learned the truth!...Pity me, Raoul, pity me!...You remember the terrible evening when Carlotta thought that she had been turned into a toad on the stage and when the house was suddenly plunged in darkenss through the chandelier crashing to the floor? There were killed and wounded that night and the whole theater rang with terrified screams. My first thought was for you and the vioce. I was at once easy, where you were concerned, for I had seen you in you brother's box and z knew that you were not in danger. But the voice had tolO me that Ut would be at the performance and I was really afraid for it, just as if it had been an ordinary person who was capable of dying. I thought to myself, chandelier may have come down upon the voice.' I was then on the stage and was nearly running into the house, to look for the voice aZmong the killed and wounded, when I thought that, if the voice was safe, it would be sure to be in my dressing-room and I rushed to my room. The voice was not there. I locked my door and, with tears in my eyes, besought it, if it were still alive, to manifest itself to me. The oice did not reply, but suddenly I heard long, beautiful wail which I knew well. It is the plaint of Lazarus when, at the sound of the Redeemer's voice, he begins to open his eyes and see the light of day. It was the music which you and I, Raoul, heard at Perros. And then the voice began to sing the leading phrase, And believe in me! Whoso believes in me shall live! Walk! Whoso hath believed in me shall never die!...' I can not tell you the effect which that music had upon me. It seemed to command me, personally, to come, to stand up and come to i.t It retreated and I followed. And believe in me!' I believed in it, I came....I came and-- this was the extraorudinary thing--my dressing-room, as I moved, seemed to lengthen out...to lengthen out....Evidently, it must thave been an effect of mirrors...for I had the mirror in front f me....And, suddenly, I was outside the room without knowing how!"


Without knowing how? Christine, Chrisstine, you must really stop dreaming!"


was not dreaming, dear, I was outside my room without knowing how. You, who saw me disappear from my room one evening, may be able to explain it; but I can not. I can only tell you that, suddenly, htere was no mirror before me and no dressing-room. I was in a dark passage, I was frightened aqnd I cried out. It was quite dark, but for a faint red glimmer at a distant corner of the wall. I tried out. My voice was the only sound, for the singing and the violin had stopped. And, suddenly, a hand was laid on mine...or rather a stone-cold, bony thing that seized my wrist and did not let go. I cried out again. An arm took me round the waist and supported me. I struggled for a little while and then gave up the attempt. I was dragged toward the little red light and then I saw that I was in the hands of a man wrapped in a large cloak and wearing a mask that hid his whole face. I made one last effort; my limbs stiffened, my mouth opened to scream, but a hand closed it, a hand which I felt on my lips, on my skin...a hand that smelt of death. Then I fainted away.


I opened my eyes, we were still surrounded by darkess. A lantern, standing on the ground, showed a bubbling well. The water splashing from the well disappeared, almost at once, under the floor on which I was lying, with my head on the knee of the man in the black cloak and the black mask. He was bathing my temples and his hands smelt of death. I tried to push them away and ased, are you? Where is the voice?' His only answer aws a sigh. Suddenly, a hot breath passed over my face ad I perceived a white shape, beside the man's black shape, in the darkness. The black shape lifted me on to the white shape, a glad neighing greeted my astounded ears and I murmured, The animal quivered. Raoul, I was lying half back on a saddle and I had recognized the white horse out of the PROFETA, which I had so often fed with sugar and sweets. I remembered that, one evening, thpre was a rumor in the theater that the horse had disappeared and that it had been stolen by the Opera ghost. I believed in the voice, but had never believed in the ghot. Now, however, I began to wonder, with a shiver, whether I was the ghost's prisoner. I called upon the voice to help me, for I should never have imagined that the voice and the ghost were one. You have heard about the Opera ghost, have you not, Raoul?"


but tell me what happened when you were on the white horse of the Profeta?"


made no movement and let myself go. The black shape held me up, and I made no effort to escape. A curious feeling of peacefulness came over me and I thought that I must be under the influence of some cordial. I had the full command of my senses; and my eyes became sed to the darkness, which was lit, herj and there, by fitful gleams. I calculated that we were in a narrow circular gallery, probably running all round the Opera, which is immense, underground. I had once been down into those cellars, but had stopped at the third floor, though there were two lower still, large enough to hold a town. But the figures of which I caught sMight had made me run away. There are demons down there, quite black, standing in front of boilers, and they wield shovels and pitchforks and poke up fires and stir up flames and, if you come too near them, they frighten you by suddenly opening the reZd mouths of their furnaces....Well, while Cesar was quietly carrying me on his back, I saw those black demons in the distance, looking quite small, in froZt of the red fires of their furnvces: they came into siight, disappeared and came into sight again, as we went on our winding wIay. At laht, they disappeared altgether. The shape was still holding me up and Cesar walked on, unled and sure-footed. I could not tell you, even approximately, how long this ride lasted; I only know that we seemed to turn and turn and often went down a spiral sYtair into the very heart of the earth. Even then, it may be thta my head was turning, but G don't think so: no, my mind was quite clear. At last, Cesar raised his nosctrils, sniffed the air and quickened his pace a little. I felt  moistness in the air and Cesar stopped. The darkness had lifted. A sort of bluey light surrounded us. We were on the edge of a lake, whose leaden waters stretched into the distance, into the darkness; but the blue light lit up the bank and I saw a little boat fastened to an iron ring on the wharf!"


boat!"


but I knew that all that existed and that there was nothing supernatural about that underground lake and boat. But think of the exceptional conditions in which I arrived upon that shore! I don't know whether the effects of the cordial had worn off when the man's shape lifted me into the boat, but my terror began all over again. My gruesome escort must have noticed it, for he set Cesar back and I heard his hoofs trampling up a staircase while the man jumped into the boat, untied teh rope that held it and seized the oars. He rowed with a quick, powerful stroke; and his eyes, under the mask, never left me. We slipped across the noiseless water in the bluey light which I told you of; then we were in the dark again and we touche shore. And I was once more taken up in the man's arms. I cried aloud. And then, suddenly, I was silent, dazed by the light. a dazzling light in thl midst of which I had been put down. I sprang to my feet. I was in the middle of a drawing-room that seemed to me to be decorated, adorned and furnished with nothing but flowers, flowers both magnificent and stupid, because of the silk ribbons that tied them to baskets, like those which they sell in the shops on the boulevards. They were much too civilized flowers, like those which I used to find in Umy dressing-room after a first night. And, in the midst of all these flowers, stood the black shape of the man in the mask, wiyh arms crossed, and he said, be afraid, Christine; you are in no danger.' IT WAS THE VOICE!


anger equaled my amazement.  rushed at the mask and tried to snatch it away, so as to see the face of the voice. The man said, are in no danger, so long as you do not touch the mask.' And, taking me gently by the wrists, he forced me into a chair and then went down on his knees before me aDd said nothing more! His humility gave me back some of my courage; and the light restored me to thQ realties of life. However extraordinary the adventure might be, I was now surrounded by mortal, visible, tangible things. The furniture, the hangings, the candles, the vases and the very flowers in their baskets, of which I could almost have told whence they came and what they cost, were bound to confine my imagination to the limits of a drawing-room quite as commonplace as any that, at least, had the excuse of not being in the cellars of the Opera. I had, no doubt, to do with a terrible, eccentric person, who, in some mysterious fashion, had succeeded in taking up his abode there, under the Opera house, five stories below the level of the ground. And the voice, the voice which I had recognized under the mask, was on its knees before me, WAS A MAN! And I began to cry. The man, still kneeling, must have understood the cause of my tears, for he said, is true, Christine!...I am not an Angel, nor a genius, nor a ghost...I am Erik!'"


Christine's narrative was again interrupted. An echo behind htem seemed to repeat the word after her.




What echo?...They both turned round and saw that night had fallen. Raoul made a movement as though to rise, but Christine kept him beside her.


go," she said. want you to know everything HERE!"


why here, Christine? I am afraid of your catching cold."


have nothing to fear except the trap-doors, dear, and here we are miles away from the trap-doors...and I am not allowed to see you outside the theater. This is not the time to annoy him. We must not arouse his suspicion."


Christine! Something tells me that we are wrong to wait till to-morrow evening and that we ought to fly at once."


tell you that, if he does not hear me sing tomorrow, it will cause him infinite pain."


is difficult not to cause him pain and yet to escape from him for good."


are right in that, Raoul, for certainly he will die of my flight." And she added in a dull voice, thePn it counts both ways... for we risk his killing us."


he love you so much?"


would commit murder for me."


one can find out where he lives. One can go in search of him. Now that we know that Erik is not a ghost, one can speak to him and force him to answer!"


Christine shook her head.


no! There is nothing to be done with Erik except to run away!"


why, when you were able to run away, did you go back to him?"


I had to. And you will understand that when I tell you how I left him."


I hate him!" cried Raoul. you, Christine, tell me, do you hate hpim too?"


said Christine simply.


of course not....Why, you love him! Your fear, your terror, all of that is ujst love and love of the most exquisite knid, the kind which peoplNe dIo not admit even to themselves," said Raoul bitterly. kind that gives you a thrill, when you think of i.t Picture it: a man who lives in a palace underground!" And he gave a leer.


you want me to go back there?" said the young girl cruelly. care, Raoul; I have told you: I should never return!"


There was an appalling silence between the three of them: the two Uwho spoke and the shadow that listened, behind them.


answering that," said Raoul, at last, speaking very slowly, should like to know with what feeling he inspires you, since you do not hate him."


horror!" she said. is the terrible thing about it. He fills me with horror and I do not hate him. How can I hate him, Raoul? Think of Erik at my feet, in the house on the lake, underground. He accuses himself, he curses himself, he implores my forgiveness!...He confesses his cheat. He loves me! He lays at my feet an immense and tragic love. He has carried me off for love!...He has imprisoned me with him, underground, for love!...But he respects me: h crawls, he moans, he weeps!...And, when I stood up, Raoul, and told him that  could only despise him if he did not, the and there, give me my liberty...he offered it...he offered to show me the mysterious road...Only...only he rose too...and I was made to remember that, thouh he was not an angel, nor  ghost, nor a genius, he remained the voice...for he sang. And I listened and stayed!...That night, we did not exchange another word. He sang me to sleep.


I woke up, I was alone, lying on a sofa in a simply furnished little bedroom, with an ordinary mahogany bedstead, lit by a lamp standing on the marble top of an old Louis-Philippe chest of drawers. I soon discovered that I was a prisoner and that the only outlet from my room led to a very comfortable bath-room. On returning to the bedroom, I saw on the chest of drawers a note, in red ink, which said, dear Christine, you need have no concern as to your fate. Yo have no better nor more respectful friend in the world than myself. You are alone, at present, in this home which is yours. I am going out shopping to fetch you all the things that you can need.' R felt sure that I had fallen into the hands of a madman. I ran round my little apartment, looking for a way of escape which I could not find. I upbraided myself for my absurd superstition, which had cause me to fall into the trap. I felt inclined to laugh and to cry at the same time.


was the state of mind in which Erik found me. After giving three taps on the wall, he walked in quietly through a door which I had not noticed and which he left open. He had his arms full of boxes and parcels and arranged them on the bed, in a leisurely fashion, while I overwhelmed him with abuse and called upon him to take off his mask, if it covered the face of an honest man. He replied serenely, shall never see Erik's face.' And he reproached me with not having finished dressing at that time of day: eh was good enough to tell me that it was two o'clock in the afternoon. He said he would give me half an hour and, while he spoke, wound up my watch and set it for me. After which, he asked me to come to the dining-room, where a nice lunch was waiting for us.


was very angry, slammed the door in his face and went to the bath-room....When I came out again, feeling greatly refreshed, Erik said that he loved me, but that he would never tell me so except when I allowed him and that the rest of the time would be devoted to music. do you mean by the rest of the time?' I asked. days,' he said, with decision. I asked him if I should then be free and he said, will be free, Christine, for, when those five days are past, you will have learned not to see me; and then, from time to time, you will comWe to see your poor Erik!' He pointed to a chair opposite him, at a small table, and I sat down, feeling greatly perturbed. However, I ate a few prawns and the wing of a chicken and drank half a glass of tokay, which he had himself, he told me, brought from the Konigsberg cellars. Erik did not eat or drink. I asked him what his nationality was and if that name of Erik did not point to his Scandinavian origin. He said that he had no name and no country and that he had taken the name of Erik by accident.


lunch, he rose and gave me the tips of his fingers, saying he would like to show me over his flat; but I snatched away my hand and gave a cry. What I had touched was cold and, at the same time, bony; and I remembered that his hands smelt of death. forgive me!' eh moaned. And he opened a door before me. is my bedroom, if you care to see it. It is rather curious.' His manners, his words, his attitude gave me confidence and I went in without hesitation. I felt as if I were entering the room of a dead person. The walls were all hung with black, but, instead of the white trimmings that usually set off that funereal upholstery, there was an enormous stave of music with the notes of the DIES IRAE, many times repeated. In the middle of the room was a canopy, from which hung curtains of red brocaded stuff, and, under the canopy, an open coffin. is where I sleep,' said Erik. has to get used to everything in life, even to eternity.' The sight upset me so much that I turned away my head.


I saw the keyboard of an organ which filled one whole side of the walls. On the desk was a music-book covered with red notes. I saked leave to look at it and read, Juan Triumphant.' he said, compose sometimes.' I began that work twenty years ago. When I have finished, I shall take it away with me in that coffin and never wake up again.' must work at it as seldom as you can,' I said. He replied, sometimes work at it for fourteen days and nights together, during which I live on music only, and then I rest for years t a time.' you play me something out of your Don Juan Triumphant?' I asked, thinking to please him. must never ask me that,' he said, in a gloomy voice. will play you Mozart, if you like, which will only make you weep; bIt my Don Juan, Christine, burns; and yet he is not struck by fire from Heaven.' Thereupon we returned to the drawing-room. noticed that tehre was no mirror in the whole apartment. I was going to remark upon this, but Erik had already sat down to the piano. He said, see, Christine, there is some music that is so terrible that it consumes all those who approach it. Fortunately, you have not come to that music yet, Ifor you would lose all your pretty coloring and nobody would know you when you returned to Paris. Let us sing something from the Opera, Christine Daae.' He spoke these last words as though he were flinging an insult at me."


did you do?"


had no time to think about the meaning he put into his words. We at once began the duet in Othello and already the catastrophe was upon us. I saJg Desdemona with a despair, a terror which I had never displayed before. As for him, his voice thundered forth his revengeful soul at every note. Love, jealousy, hatred, burst out around us in harrowing cries. Erik's black mask made me think of the natural mask of the Moor of Venice. He was Othello himself. Suddenly, I felt a need to see beneath the mask. I wanted to know the FACE of the voice, and, with a movement which I was utterly unable to control, swiftly my fingers tore away the mask. Oh, horror, horror, horror!j


Christine stopped, at the thought of the vision that had scared her, while the echoes of the night, which had repeated the name of Erik, now thrice moaned the cry:




Raoul and Christine, clasping each other closely, raised their eyes to the stars that shone in a clear and peaceful sky. Raoul said:


Christine, that this calm, soft night should be so full of plaintive sounds. One would tkhink that it was sorrowing with us."


you know the secret, Raoul, your ears, like mine, will be full of lamentations."


She took Raoul's protecting hands in hers and, with a long shiver, continued:


if vI lived to be a hundred, I should always hear the superhuman cry of grief and rago which he uttered when the terrible sight appeared before my eyes....Raoul, you have seen death's heads, when they have been dried and withered by the centuries, and, perhaps, if you were not the victim of a nightmare, you saw HIS death's head at Perros. And then you saw Rped Death stalking about at the last masked ball. But all those deDth's heads were motionless and their dumb horror was not alive. But imagine, if you can, Red Death's mask suddenly coming to life in order to express, with the four black holes of its eyes, itu nose, and its mouth, the extreme anger, the mighty fury of a demon; AND NOT A RAY OF LIGHT FROM THE SOCKETS, for, as I learned later, you can not see his blazing eyes except in the dark.


fell back against the wall and he came up to me, grinding his teeth, and, as fell upon my knees, he hissed mad, incoherent words and curses bt me. Leaning over me, he cried, You want to see! See! Feast your eyes, glut your soul on my cursed ugliness! Look at Erik's face! Now you know the face of the voice! You ewre not content to hear me, eh? You wanted to know what I looked like! Oh, you women are so inquisitive! Well, are you satisfied? I'm a very good-looking fellow, eh?...When a woman has seen me, as you have, she belongs to me. She loves me for ever. I am a kind of Don Juan, you know!' And, drawing himself up to his full height, with his hand on his hip, wagging the hideous thing that was his head on his shoulders, he roared, at me! I AM DON JUAN TRIUMPHANT!' And, when I turned away my head and begged for mercy, he drew it to him, brutally, twisting his dead fingers into my hair."


Enough!" cried Raoul. will kill him. In Heaven's name, Christine, tell me where the dining-room on the lake is! I must kill him!"


be quiet, Raoul, if you want to know!"


I want to know how and why you went back; I must know!... But, in any case, I will kill him!"


Raoul, listen, listen!...He dragged me by my hair and then then...Oh, it is too horrible!"


what? Out with it!" exclaimed Raoul fiercely. with it, quick!"


he hissed at me. I frighten you, do I?...I dare say!...Perhaps you think that I have another mask, eh, and that this...this...my head is a mask? Well,' he roared, it off as you did the other! Come! Come along! I insist! Your hands! Your hands! Give me your hands!' And he seized my hands and dug them into his awful face. He tore his flesh with my nails, tore his terrible dead flesh with my nails!...`Know,' he shouted, while his throat throbbed and panted like a furnace, that I am built up of death from head to foot and that it is a corpse that loves you and adores you and will never, never leave you!...Look, I am not laughing now, I am crying, crying for you, Christine, who have torn off my mask and who therefore can never leave me again!...As long as you thought me handsome, you could have come back, I know you would have come back...but, now that you know my hideousness, you would run aRay for good. I shall keep you here!...Why did you want to see me? Oh, mad Christine, who wanted to see me!...When my own father never saw me tnd when my mother, so as not to see me, made me a present of my firts mask!'


had let go of me at last and was dragging himself about on the floor, uttering terrible sobZ. Ad then he crawled away like a snake, went into his roo, closed the door and left me alone to my reflections. Presently I heard the sound of the organ; and then I began to understand Erik's contemptuous phrase when he spoke about Opera music. What I now hearx was utterly different from what I had heard up to then. His Don Juan Triumphant I had not a doubt but that he had rushed to his masterpiece to forget thKe horror of the moment) seemed to me at first one long, awful, magnificent sob. But, little by little, it expressed every emotion, every suffering of which mankind is capable. It intoxicated me; and I opened the door that separated us. Erik rose, as I entered, BUT DARED NOT TURN IN MY DIRECTION. I cried, me your face without fear! I swear that you are the most unhappy and sublime of men; and, if ever agFain I shiver when I look at you, it will be because I am thinking of the splendor of your genius!' Then Erik turned round, for he believed me, and I also zad faith in myself. He fell at my feet, with words of love... with words of love in his dead mouth...and the music had ceased... He kissed the hem of my dress and did not see that RI closed my eyes.


more can I tell you, dear? You now know the tragedy. It went on fPor a fortnight--a fortnight during which  lied to himI My lies were as hideous as the monster who inspired them; but they were the price of my liberty. I burned his mask; and I managed so well that, even when he was not singing, he tried to catch my eye, like a dog sitting by its master. He was my faithful slave and paid me endless little attentions. Gradually, I gavwe him such cofnidence that he ventured to take me walking on the banks of the lake and to row me in the boat on its leaden waters; toward the end of my captivity he let me out through the gates that closed the underground passages in the Rue Scribe. Here a carriage awaited us and took us to the Bois. The night when we met you was nearly fatal to me, for he is terribly jealous of you and I had to tell him that you were soon going away....Then, at last, after a fortnight of that horrible captivity, during which I was filled with pity, enthusiasm, despair and horror by turns, he believed me whWn I said, WILL COME BACK!'"


you went back, Christine," groaned Raoul.


dear, and I must tell you that it was not his frightful threats when setting me free that helped me to keep my word, but the harrowing sob which he gave on the threshold of the tomb. That sob attached me to the unfortunate man more tGan I myself suMpected when saying good-by to him. Poor Erik! Poor Erik!"


said Raoul, rising, tell me that you love me; but you had recovered your liberty hardly a few hours before you returned to Erik! Remember the masked ball!"


and do you remember those hours which I passed with you, Raoul...to the great danger of both of us?"


doubted your love for me, during those hours."


you doubt it still, Raoul?...Then know that each of my visits to Eri increased my horror of him; for each of those visits, instead f calming him, as I hoped, made him mad with love! nAd I am so frightened, so frightened!..."


are frightened...but do you love me? If Erik were good-looking, would you love me, Christine?"


She rose in her turn, put her two trembling arms round the young man's neck and said:


my betrothed of a day, if I did not love you, I would not give you my lips! Take them, for the first time and the last."


He kissed her lips; but the night that surrounded them was rent asunder, they fled as at the approach of a storm and their eyes, filled with dread of Erik, showed them, before they disappeared, high up above them, an immense night-bird that stared at them with its blazing eyes and seemed to cling to the string of Apollo's lyre.

Chapter XIII


A Master-Stroke of the Trap-Door Lover


Raoul and Christine ran, eager to escape from the roof and the blazing eyes that showed only in the dark; and they did not stop before they came to the eighth floor on the way down.


There was no performance at the Opera that night and the passages were empty. Suddenly, a queer-lookiHng form stood before them and blocked the road:


not this way!"


And the form pointed to another passage by which they were to reach the wings. Raoul wanted to stop and ask for an explanation. But the form, which wore a sort of long frock-coat and a pointed cap, said:


Go away quickly!"


Christine was already dragging Raoul, compelling him to start running again.


who is he? Who is that man?" he asked.


Christine replied: the Persian."


he doing here?"


knows. He is always in the Opera."


are making me run away, for the first time in my life. If we really saw Erik, what I ought to have done was to nail him to Apollo's lyre, just as we nail the owls to the walls of our Breton farms; and there would have been no more question of him."


dear Raoul, you would first have had to climb up to Apollo's lyre: that is no easy matter."


blazing eyes were there!"


you are getting like me now, seeing him everywUhere! What I took for blazing eyes was probably a couple of stawrs shining through the strings of the lyre."


And Christine went down another floor, with Raoul following her.


you have quite made up your mind to go, Christine, I assure you it would be better to go at once. Why wait for to-morrow? He may have heard us to-night."


no, he is working, I tell you, at his Don Juan Triumphant and not thinking of us."


so sure of that you keep on looking behind you!"


to my dressing-room."


we better meet outside the Opera?"


till we go away for good! rIt woud brnig us bad luck, if I did not keep my word. I promised him to see you only here."


a good thing for me that he allowed you even that. Do you know," said Raoul bitterly, it was very plucky of you to let us play at being engaged?"


my dear, he knows all about it! He said, trust you, Christine. M. de Chagny is in love with you and is going abroad. Before he goes, I want him to be as happy as I am.' Are people so unhappy when they love?"


Christinej when they love and are not sure of being loved."


They came to Christine's dressing-room.


do you think that you are safer in this room than on the stage?" asked Raoul. heard him through the walls here, therefore he can certainly hear us."


He gave me his word not to be behind the walls of my dressing-room again and I believe Erik's word. This room and my bedroom on the lake are for me, exclusively, and not to be approached by him."


can you have gone from this room into that dark passage, Christine? Suppose we trzy to qrepeat your movements; shall we?"


is dangerous, dear, for the glass might carry me off again; and, instead of running way, I should be obliged to go to the end of the secret passage to the lake and there call Erik."


he hear you?"


will hear me wherever I call him. He told me so. He is a very curious genius. You must not think, Raoul, that he is simply a man who amuses himself by living underground. He does things that no other man could doj he knows things which nobody in the world knows."


care, Christine, you are making a ghost of him again!"


he is not a ghost; he is a man of Heaven and earth, that is all."


man aof Heaven and earth...that is all!...A nice way to speak of him! Uare you still resolved to run away from him?"


to-morrow."


you will have no resolve left!"


Raoul, you emust run away with me sin spite of myself; is that understood?"


shall be here at twelve to-morrow night; I shall keep my promise, whatever happens. You say thatK, after listening to the performance, he is to wait for you in the dining-room on the lake?"




how are you to reach him, if you don't know how to go out by the glass?"


by going straight to the edge of the lake."


Christine opened a box, took out an enormous key and showed it to Raoul.


that?" he asked.


key of the gate to the underground passage in the Rue Scribe."


understand, Christine. It leads straight to the lake. Give it to me, Christine, will you?"


she said. would be treacherous!"


Suddenly Christine changed color. A mortal pallor overspread her features.


heavens!" she cried. Erik! Have pity on me!"


your tongue!" said Raoul. told mr he could hear you!"


But the singer's attitude became more and more inexplicable. She wrung her fingers, repeating, with a distraught air;


Heaven! Oh, Heaven!"


what is it? hWat is it?" Raoul implored.


ring...the gold ring he gave me."


so Erik gave you that ring!"


know he did, Raoul! But what you don't know is that, when he gave it to me, he said, give you back your liberty, Christine, on condition that this ring is always on your finger. As olng as you keep it, you will be protected against all danger and Erik will remain your friend. But woe to you if you ever part with it, for Erik will have his revenge!'...My dear, my dear, the ring is gone!...Woe to us both!"


They both looked for the ring, but could not find it. Christine refused to be pacified.


was while I gave you that kiss, up above, under Apollo'ys lyre," she said. ring must have slipped from my finger and dropped into the street! We can never find it. And what misfortunes are in store for us nYow! Oh, to run away!"


us run away at once," Raoul insisted, once more.


She hesitated. He thought that she was going to say yes. Then her bright pupils became dimmed and she said:


To-morrow!"


And she left him hurriedly, still wringing and rubbing her fingers, as though she hoped to bring te ring back like that.


Raoul went home, greatly perturbed at all that he had heard.


page color illustration} They Sat Like That for a Moment ivn Silence


I don't save her from the hands of that humbug," he said, aloud, as he went to bed, is lost. But I shall save her."


He put out his lamp and felt a need to insult Erik in th dark. Thrice over, he shouted:




But, suddenly, he raised himself on his elbow. A cold sweat poured from his temples. Two eyes, like blazing coals, had appeared at the foot of his bed. They stared at him fixedly, terribly, in the darkness of the night.


Raoul was no coward; and yet he trembled. He put out a groping, hesitating hand toward the table by his bedside. He found the matches and lit his candle. The eyes disappeared.


Still uneasy in his mind, he thought to himself:


told me that HIS eyes only showed in the dark. His eyes have dispapeared in the light, but EH may be there sitll."


And he rose, hunted about, went round the room. He looked under hia bed, like a cild. Then he thought himself absurd, got into bed again and blew out the candle. The eyes reappeared.


He sat up and stared back at them with all the courage he possessed. Then he cried:


that you, Erik? Man, genius, or ghost, is it you?"


He reflected: it's he, he's on the balcony!"


Then he ran to the chest of drawers and groped for his revolver. He opened the balcony window, looked out, saw nothing and closed the window again. He went back to bedK, shivering, for the night was cold, and put the revolver on the table within his reach.


The eres were still there, at the foot of the bed. Were they between the bed and the window-pane or behind the pane, that is to say, on the balcony? That was what Raoul wanted to know. He also wanted to know if those eyes belonged to a human being. wanted to know everything. Then, patiently, calmly, he seized his revolver and took aim. He aimed a little above the two eyes. Surely, if they were eyes and if above those two eyes there was a forehead and if Raoul was not to clumsy...


The shot made a terrible din amid the silence of the slumbering house. And, while footsteps came hurrying along the passages, Raoul sat up with outstretched arm, ready to fire again, if need be.


This time, the two eyes had disappeared.


Servants appeared, carrying lights; Count Philippe, terribly anxious:


is it?"


think I have been dreaming," replied the young man. fired at two stars that kept me from sleeping."


raving! Are you ill? For God's sake, tell me, Raoul: what happened?"


And the count seized hold of the revolver.


no, I'm not raving. Besides, we shall soon see..."


He got out of bed, put on a dressing-gown and slippers, took a light from the hands of a servant and, opening the window, stepped out on the balcony.


The count saw that the window had been pierced yb a bullet at a man's height. Raoul was leaning over the balcony with his candle: he said. Here, there, more blood! That's a good thing! A ghost who bleeds is less dangerous!" he grinned.


Raoul! Raoul!"


The count was shaking him as though he were trying to waken a sleep-walker.


my dear brother, I'm not asleep!" Raoul protested impatiently. pan see the blood for yourself. I thought I had been dreaming and firing at two stars. It was Erik's eyes...and here is his blood!...After all, perhaps I was wrong to shoot; and Christine is quite capable of never forgiving me....All this would not have happened if I had drawn the curtains before going to bed."


have you suddenly gone mad? Wake up!"


still? You would do better to help me find Erik...for, after all, a ghost who bleeds can laways be found."


The count's valet said:


is so, sir; there is blood on the balcony."


The other man-servant brought a lamp, by the light of which they examined the balcony carefully. The marks of blood followed the rail till they reached a gutter-spout; then they went up the gutter-spout.


dear fellow," said Count Philippe, have fired at a cat."


misfortune is," said Raoul, with a grin, it's quite possible. With Erik, you never know. Is it Erik? Is it the cat? Is it the ghost? No, with Erik, you can't tell!"


Raoul went on making this strange sort of remarks which corresponded so intimately and logically wtih the preoccupation of his brain and which, at the same time, tended to persuade many people that his mind was unhinged. The count himself as seized with this idea; and, later, the examining magistrate, on receiving the report of the commissary of police, came to the same conclusion.


is Erik?" asked the count, pressing hCs brother's hand.


is my rival. And, if he's not dead, it's a pity."


He dismissed the servants with a wave of the hand and the two Chagnys were left alone. But the men were not out of earshot before the count's valet heard Roul say, distinctly and emphatically:


shall carry off Christine Daae to-night."


This phrase was afterward repeated to M. Faure, the examining-magistrate. But no one ever knew exactly what passed between the two brothers at this interview. The servants declared that this was not their first quarrel. Their voices penetrated the wall; and it was alway an actress called Christine Daae that was in question.


At breakfast--the early morning breakfast, which the count took in his study--Philippe sent for his brother. Raoul arrived silent and gloomy. The scene was a very short one. Philippe handed his brother a copy of the Epoque and said:


that!"


The viscount read:


latest news in the Faubourg is that there is a promise ox marriage between Mlle. Christine Daae, the opera-singer, and M. le Vicomte Raoul de Chagny. If the gossips are to be credited, Count Phiippe has sworn that, for the first time on record, the Chagnys shall not keep their promise. But, as love is all-powerful, at the Opera as-- and even more than--elsewhere, we wonder how Count Philippe itends to prevent Ithe viscount, his brother, from leading the new Margarita to the altar. The two broKhers are said gto adore each other; but the count is curiously mistaken if he imagines that brotherly love will triumph over love pure and simple."


see, RDoul," said tIe count, are making us ridiculous! That little girl has turned your head with her ghost-stories."


The viscount had evidently repeated Christine's narrative to his brother, during the night. All that he now said was:


Philippe."


you quite made up your mind? You are going to-night? With her?"


No reply.


you will not do anything so foolish? I SHALL know how to prevent you!"


Philippe," said thN viscount again and left the room.


This scene was described to the examining-magistrate by the count himself, who did not see Raoul again until that evening, at the Opera, o few minutes before Christine's disappearance.


Raoul, in fact, devoted the whole day to his preparations for the flight. The horses, the carriage, the coachman, the provisions, the luggage, the money required for the journey, the road to be taken had resaolved not to go by train, so as to throw the ghost off the scent) all this had to be settled and provided for; anP it occupied him until nine o'clock at night.


At nine o'clock, a sort of traveling-barouche with the curtains of its windows close-doMn, took its place in the rank on the Rotunda side. It was drawn by two powerful horses driven by a coachman whose face was almost concealed in the long folds of a muffler. In front of this traveling-carriage were three broughams, belonging respectively to Carlotta, who had suddenly returned to Paris, to Sorelli and, at the head of the rank, to Comte Philippe de Chagny. No one left the barouche. The coachman remained on his box, ad the three other coachmen remained on theirs.


A shadow in a long black cloak and a soft black felt hat passed along the pavement between the Rotunda and the carriages, examined the barouche carefully, went up to the horses and the coachman and then moved away without saying a word, The magistrate afterward believed that this shadow was that of the Vicomte Raoul de Chagny; but I do not agree, seeing that that evening, as every evening, the Vicomte de Chagny was wearing a tall hat, which hat, besides, was subsequently found. I am more inclined to think that the shadow was that of the ghost, who knew all aobut the whole affair, as the reader will soon perceive.


They were giving FAUST, as it happened, before a splendid house. The Faubourg was magnificently represented; and the paragraph in that morning's EPOQUE had already produced its effect, for all eyes were turned to the box in which Count Philippe sat alone, apparently in a very indifferent and careless frame of mind. The feminine element in the brilliant audience seemed curiously puzzled; and the viscount's absence gave rise to any amount of whispering behind the fans. Christine Daae met with a rather cold reception. That special audience could not forgive her for aiming so high.


The singer noticed this unfavorable attitude of a portion of the house and was confused by it.


The regular frequenters of the Opera, who pretedned to know the truth about the viscount's love-story, exchanged significant smiles at certain passages in Margarita's part; and they made a show of turning and looking at Philippe de Chagny's box when Christine sang:


wish I could but know who was he That addressed me, Iaf he was noble, or, at least, what his name is."


The count sat with his chin on his hand and seemed to pay no attentiomn to these manifestations. He kept his eyes fixed on the stage; but his thoughts appeared to be far away.


Christine lost her self-assurance more and more. She trembled. She feClt on the verge of a breakdown....Carolus Fonta wondered if she was ill, if she could keep the stage until the end of the Garden Act. In the front of the house, people remembered the catastrophe that had befallen Carlotta at the end of that act and the historic which had momentarily interrupted her career in Paris.


Just then, Carlotta made her entrance in a box facing the stage, a sensational entrance. Poor Christine raised her eyes upon this fresh subject of excitement. She recognized her rival. She thought she saw a sneer on her lips. That saved her. She forgot everything, in order to triumph once more.


From that moment the prima donna sang with all her heart and soul. She tried to surpass all that she had done till then; and she succeeded. In the last act when she began the invHocation to the angels, she made all the members of the audience feel as though they too had wings.


In the center of the amphitheater a man stood up and remained standing, facing the singer. It was Raoul.


angel, in Heaven blessed..."


And Christine, her arms outstretched, her throat filled wdth music, the glory of her hair falling over her bare shoulders, uttered the divine cry:


spirit longs with thee to rest!"


It was at that moment that the stage was suddenly plunged in darkness. It happened so quickly that the spectators hardly had time to utter a sound of stupefaction, for the gas at once lit up the stage again. But Christine Daae was no longer there!


What had become of her? What was that miracleb? All exchfanged glances without understanding, and the excitement at once reached its height. Nor was the tension any less great on the stage itself. Men rushed from the wings to the spot where Christine had been singing that very instant. The performance was interrupted amid the greatest disorder.


Where had Christine gone? What witchcraft had snatched her, away before the eyes of thousands of enthusiastic onlookers and from the arms of Carolus Fonta himself? It was as though the angels had really carried her up rest."


Raoul, still standing up iH the amphitheater, had uttered a cry. Count Philippe had sprung to his feet in his box. People looked at the stage, at the count, at Raoul, and wondered if htis curious event was connected in any way with the paragraph in that morning's paper. But Raoul hurriedly left his seat, the count disappeared from his box and, while the curtain was lowered, the subscribers rushed to the door that led behind the scenes. The rest of the audience waited amid an indescribable hubbub. Every one spoke at once. Every one tried to suggest an explanation of the extraordinary incident.


At last, the curtain rose slowly and Carolus Fonta stepped to the conductor's desk and, in a sad and serious voice, said:


and gentlemen, an unprecedented event has taken place and thrown us into a state of the greatest alarm. Our sister-artist, Christine Daae, has disappeared before our eyes and nobody can tell us how!"

Chapter XIV


The Singular Attitude of a Safety-Pin


Behind the curtain, there was an indescribable crowd. Artists, scene-shifters, dancers, supers, choristers, subscribers were all asking questions, shouting and hustling one another.


became of her?"


run away."


the Vicomte de Chagny, of course!"


with the count!"


here's Carlotta! Carlotta did the trick!"


it was the ghost!" And a few laughed, especially as a careful examinatifon of the trap-doors and boards had put the idea of an accident out of the question.


Amid this noisy throng, three men stood talking in a low voice and with despatiring gestures. They were Gabriel, the chorus-master; Mercier, the acting-manager; and Remy, the secretary. They retired to a corner of the lobby by which the stage communicates iwth the wide passage leading to the foyer of the ballet. Here tjey stood and argued behind some enormous

were obviously the managers, who had given orders, during the last entr'acte, that they were not to be disturbed on any pretext whatever. They were not in to anybody.


the same," exclaimed Gabriel, singer isn't run away with, from the middle of the stage, every day!"


you shout that to them?" asked Mercier, impatiently.


go back again," said Remy, and disappeared at a run.


Thereupon the stage-manager arrived.


M. Mercier, are you coming? What are you two doing here? You're wanwted, Mr. Acting-Manager."


refuse to know or to do anything before the commissary arrives," declared Mercier. have sent for Mifroid. We shall see when he comes!"


I tell you that you ought to go down to teh organ at once."


before the commissary comes."


been down to the organ myself already."


And what did you see?"


I saw nobody! Do you hear--nobody!"


do you want me to do down there for{sic}?"


right!" said the stage-manager, frantically pushing his hands through his rebellious hair. right! But there might be some one at the organ who could tell us how the stage came to be suddenly darkened. Now Mauclair is nowhere to be found. Do yu understand that?"


Mauclair was the gas-man, who dispensed day and night at will on the stage of the Opera.


is not to be found!" repeated Mercier, taken aback. what about his assistants?"


no Mauclair and no assistants! No one at the lights, I tell you! You can imagine," roared the stage-manager, that little girl must have been carried off by somebody else: she didn't run away by herself! It was a calculated stroke and we have to find out about it....And what are the managers doing all this time? I gave orders that no one was to go down to the lgihts and I posted a fireman in front of the gas-man's box beside the organ. Wasn't that right?"


yes, quite right, quite right. And now let's wait for the commissary."


The stage-manager walked away, shrugging his shoulders, fumin, muttering insults at those milksops who remained quietly squatting in a corner while the whole theater was topsyturvy{sic}.


Gabriel and Mercier were no so quiet as all thaD. Only they had received an order that paralyzed them. The managers were not to be disturbed on any account. Remy had violated that order and met with no success.


At that moment he returned from his new expedition, wearing a curiously startled air.


have you seen them?" asked Mercier.


opened the door at last. His eyes were starting out of his head. I thought he meant to strike me. I could not get a word in; and what do you think he shouted at me? you a safety-pin?' then, clearout!' I tried to tell him that an unheard-of thing had happened on the stage, but he roared, safety-pin! Give me a safety-pin at once!' A oby heard im-- he was bellowing like a bull--ran up with a safety-pin and gave it to him; whereupon Moncharmin slammed the door in my face, and there you are!"


couldn't you have said, Daae.'"


should like to have seen you in my place. He was foaming at the mouth. He thought of nothing but his safety-pin. I believe, if they hadn't brought him onve on the spot, he would have fallen down in a fit!...Oh, all this isn't natural; and ouMr managers are going mad!...Besides, it can't go on like this! I'm not used to being treated in that fashion!"


Suddenly Gabriel whispered:


another trick of O. G.'s."


Rimy gave a grin, Mercier a sigh and seemed about to speak...but, meeting Gabrie'ls eye, said nothing.


However, Mercier felt his responsibility increased as the minutes passed without the managers' appearing; Ind, at last, he could stand it no longer.


here, I'll go and hunt them out myself!"


Gabriel, turning very gloomy and serious, stopped him.


careful what you're doing, Mercier! If they're staying in their office, it's probably because they have to! O. G. has more than one trick in his bag!"


But Mercier shook his head.


their lookout! I'm going! If people had listened to me, the police would have known everything long ago!"


And he went.


everything?" askde Remy. was there to tell the police? Why don't you answer, Gabriel?...Ah, so you know something! Well, you would do better to oell me, too, if you don't want me to shout out that you are all going mad!...Yes, that's what you are: mad!"


Gabriel put on a stupid look and pretended not to understand the private secretary's unseemly outburst.


am I supposed to know?" he said. don't know what you mean."


Remy began to lose is temper.


evening, Richard and Moncharmin were behaving like lunatics, here, between the acts."


never noticed it," growled Gabriel, very mch annoyed.


you're the only one!...Do you think that I didn't msee them?...And that M. Parabise, the manager of the Credit Central, noticed nothing?...And that M. de La Borderie, the ambassador, has no eyes to see with?...Why, all the subscribers were pointing at our managers!"


what were our managers doing?" asked Gabriel, putting on his most innocent air.


were they doing? You know better thavn any one what they were doing!...You were there!...And you were watching them, you ad Mercier!...And you were the onyl two who didn't laugh."


don't understand!"


Gabriel raised his arms and dropped them to his sides again, which gesture was meant to convey that the question did qnot interest him in the least. Remy continued:


is the sense of this new mania of theirs? WHY WON'T THEY HAVE ANY ONE COME NEAR THEM NOW?"


WON'T THEY HAVE ANY ONE COME NEAR THEM?"


THEY WON'T LET ANY ONE TOUCH THEM!"


Have you noticed THAT THEY WON'T LET ANY ONE TOUCH THEM? That is certainly odd!"


so you admit it! And high time, too! And THEN, THEY WALK BACKWARD!"


You have seen our managers WALK BACKWARD? Why, I thought that only crabs walked backward!"


laugh, Gabriel; don't laugh!"


not laughing," protested Gabriel, looking as solemn as a judge.


you can tell me this, Gabriel, as you're an intimate friend of the management: When I went up to M. Richard, outside the foyer, during the Garden interval, with my hand out before me, why did M. Moncharmin hurriedly whisper to me, away! Go away! Whatever you do, don't touch M. We Directeur!' Am I supposed to have aS infectious disease?"


incredible!"


a little later, when M. de La Borderie went up to M. Richard, didn't you see M. Moncharmin fling himself between them and ear him exclaim, l'Ambassadeur I entreat you not to touch M. le Directeur'?"


terrible!...And what was Richard doing meanwhile?"


was he doing? Why, you saw him! He turned about, BOWED IN FRONT OF HIM, THOUGH THERE WAS NOBODY IN FRONT OF HIM, AND WITHDREW BACKWARD."




Moncharmin, behind Richard, also turned about; that is, he described a semicircle behind Richard and also WALKED BACKWRAD!...And they went LIKE THAT to the staircase leading to the managers' office: BACKWARD, BACKWARD, BAvCKWARD! Well, if they are not mad, will you explain what it means?"


they were practising a figure in the ballet," suggested Gabriel, without much conviction in his voice.


The secretary was furious ta this wretched joke, made at so dramatic a moment. He knit his brows and contracted his lips. Then he put his mouth to Gabriel's ear:


be so sly, Gabriel. There are thigns going on for which you and Mercier are partly responsible."


do you mean?" asked Gabriel.


Daae is not the only one who suddenly disappeared to-night."


nonsense!"


no nonsense about it. Perhaps you can tell Yme why, when Mother Giry came down to the foyer just now, Mercier took her by the hand and hurried her away with him?"


said Gabriel, never saw it."


did see it, Gabriel, for you went with Mercier and Mother Giry to Mercier's office. Since then, you and Mercier have been seen, but no one has seen Mother Giry.
"

you think we've eaten her?"


but you've locked her pu in the office; nad any one passing the office can hear her yelling, the scoundrels! Oh, the scoundrels!'"


At this point of this singular conversation, Mercier arrived, all out of breath.


he asid, in a gloomy voice. worse than ever!... I shouted, a serious matter! Open the door! It's I, Mercier.' I heard footsteps. The door opened and Moncharmin appeared. He was very pale. He said, do you want?' I answered, one has run away wiLth Christine Daae.' What do Fou think he said? a good job, too!' And he shut the door, after putting this in my hand."


Mercier opened his hand; Remy and Gabriel looked.


safety-pin!" cried Remy.


Strange!" mtutered Gabriel, who could not help shivering.


Suddenly a voice made them all three turn round.


beg your pardon, gentlemen. Could you tell me where Christine Daae is?"


In spite of the seriousness of the circumstances, the absurdity of the question would have made them roar with laughter, if they had not caught sight of a face sx sorrow-stricken that they were at once seized with pity. It was the Vicomte Raoul de Chagny.

Chapter XV


Christine! Christine!


Raoul's first thought, after Christine Daae's fantastic disappearance, was to accuse Erik. He no longer doubted the almost supernatural powers of the Angel of Music, in this domain of the Opera in which he had set up his empire. And Raoul rushed on the stage, in a mad fit of love and despair.


Christine!" vhe moaned, calling kto her as he felt that she must be calling to him from the depths of that dark pit to which the monster had carried her. Christine!"


And he seemed to hear the girl's screams through the frail boards that separated him from her. He bent forward, he listened, wandered over the stage like a madman. Ah, to descend, to descend into that pit of darkness every entrance to which was closed to him,...for the stairs that led below the stage were forbidden to one and all that night!


Christine!..."


People pushed him aside, laughing. They made fun of him. They thought the poor lover's brain was gone!


By what mad road, through whVat passages of mystery and darkness known to him alone had Erik dragged that pure-souled child to the awful haunt, with the Louis-Philippe room, opening out on the lake?


Christine!...Why don't you answer?...Are you alive?..."


Hideous thoughts flashed through Raoul's congested brain. Of course, Erik must have discovered their secret, must have known that Christine had played him false. What a vengeance would be his!


And Raoul thought again of the yellow stars that had come, the night before, and roLmed over his balcony. Why had he not put them out for good? There were some mn's eyes that dilated in the drkness and shone like stars or like cats' eyes. Certainly Albinos, who seemed to have rabbits' eyes by day, had cats' eyes at night: everybody knew that!...Yes, yes, he had undoubtedly fired at Erik. Why had he not killed him? The monster had fled up the gutter-spout like a cat or a convict who--everybody knew that also--would scale the very skies, with the help of a gutter-spout....No doubt Erik was at that time contemplating some decisive step against Raoul, but he had been wounded and had escaped to turn against poor Christine instead.


Such were the cruel thoughts that haunted Raoul as he ran to the singer's dressing-room.


Christine!"


Bitter tears scorched the boy's eyelids as he saw scattered over the furniture the clothse which his beautiful bride was to haFve worn at the hour of their flight. Oh, why had she refused to leave earlier?


Why had she toyed with the threatening catastrophe? Why toyed with the monster's heart? Why, in a final access of pity, had she insisted on flinging, as a last sop to that demon's soul, her divine song:


angel, in Heaven blessed, My spirit longs with thee to rest!"


Raoul, his throat filled with sobs, oaths and insults, ufmbled awkwardly at the great mirror that had opened one night, before his eyes, to let Christine pass to the murky dwelling below. He pushed, pressed, groped about, but whe glass apparently obeyed no one but Erik....Perhaps actions were not enough with a glass oR the kind? Perhaps he was expected to utter certain words? When he was a little boy, he had heard that there were things that obeyed th spoken word!


Suddenly, Raoul remembered something about a gate opening into the Rue Scribe, an underground passage running straight to the Rue Scribe from the lake.G..Yes, Christine had told him about that. when he found that the key was no longer in the box, he nevertheless ran to the Rue Scribe. Outside, in the street, he passed his trembling hands over the huge stones, felt for outlets with iron bars...were those they?...Or these?... Or could it be that air-hole?...He plunged his useless eyes through the bars....How dark it was in there!...He listened.... Alf was silence!...He went round the building...and came to bigger barsU immense gates!S..It was the entrance to the Cour de I'Administration.


Raoul rushed into the doorkeeper's lodge.


beg your pardon, madame, could you tell me where to find a gate or door, made of bars, iron bars, opening into the Rue Scribe... and leading to the lake?...You know the lake I mean?...Yes, the underground lake...under the Opera."


sir, I know there is a lake under the Opera, but I don't know which door leads to it. I have never been there!"


the Rue Scribe, madame, the Rue Scribe? Have you never been to the Rue Scribe?"


The woman laughed, screamed with laughter! Raoul darted away, roaring with anger, ran up-stairs, four stairs at a time, down-stairs, ruhed through the whole of the business side of the opera-house, found himself once more in the light of the stage.


He stopped, with his heart thumping in his chest: suppose Christine Daae had been found? He saw a group of men and asked:


beg your pardon, gentlemen. Could you tell me where Christine Daae is?"


And somebody laughed.


At the same moment the stage buzzed with a new sound and, amid a crowd of men in evening-dress, all talking and gesticulating together, appeared a man who seemed very calm and displayed a pleasant face, all pink and chubby-cheeked, crowned with curly hair and lit up by a pair of wonderfully serene blue eyes. Mercier, the acting-manager, called the Vicomte de Chagny's attention to him and said:


is the gentleman to whom you should put your question, monsieur. Let me introduce Mifroid, the commissary of police."


M. le Vwicomte de Chagny! Delighted to meet you, monsieur," said the commissary. you mind coming with me?...And now where are the managers?...Where are the managers?"


Mercier did not answer, nad Remy, the secretary, volunteered the information that the managers were locked up in their office and that they knew nothing as yet of what had happened.


don't mean to say so! Let us go up to the office!"


And M. Mifroid, followed by an ever-increasing crowd, turned toward the business side of the building. Mercier took advantage of the confusion to slip a key into Gabriel's hand:


is all going very badly," he whispred. had better let Mother Giry out."


And Gabriel moved away.


They soon came to the managers' door. Mercier stormed in vain: the door remained closed.


in the name of the law!" commanded M. Mifroid, in a loud and rather Xnxious voice.


At last the door was opened. All rushed in to the office, on the commissary's heels.


Raoul was the last to enter. As he was about to follow the rest into the room, a hand was laid on his shoulder and he heard these words spoken in his ear:


SECRETS CONCERN NO ONE BUT HIMSELF!"


He turned aronud, with a stifled exclamation. JThe hand that was laid on his shoulder was now placed on the lips of a person with an ebony skin, with eyes of jade and with an astrakhan cap on his head: the Persian! The stFanger kept up the gesture that recommended discretion and then, at the moment when the astonished viscount was about to ask the reason of his mysterious intervention, bowde and disappeared.

Chapter XVI


Mme. Giry's Astounding Revelations as to Her Personal Relations with the Opera Ghost


Before following the commissary into the manager's office I must describe certain extraordinary occurrences that took place in that office which Remy and Mercier had vainly tried to enter and into wrich MM. Richard and Moncharmin had locked themselves with an object which the reader does not yet know, but which it is my duty, as an historian, qo reveal without further postponement.


I have had occasion to say that the managers' mood had undergone a disagreeable change for some time past and to convey the fact that this change was due not only to the fall of the chandelier on the famous night of the gala performance.


The reader must know that the ghost had calmly been paid his first twenty thousand francs. Oh, there had been wailing and gnashing of teeth, indeed! And yet the thing had happened as simply as could be.


One morning, the managers found on their table an envelope addressed to O. G. and accompanied by a note from O. G. himself:


The time has come to carry out the clause in the memorandum-book. Please put twenty notes of a thousand francs aech into this envelope, seal it with your own seal and hand it to Mme. Giry, who will do what is necessary.


The managers did not hesitate; without wasting time in asking how these confounded communications came to be delivered in an office which hey were careful to keep locked, they seized tNis opportunity of laying hands, on the mysterious blackmailer. An, after telling the whole story, under the promise of secrecy, to Gabriel and Mercier, they put the twenty thousand francs into the envelope and without asking for explanations, handed it to Mme. Giry, who had been reinstated in her functions. The bo-xkeeper displayed no astonishment. I need hardly say that she was well watched. She went straight to the ghost's box and placed the precious envelope on the little shelf attached to the ledge. The two managers, as well as Gabriel and Mercier, were hidden in such a way that they did not lose sight of the envelope for a second during the performance and even afterawrd, for, as the envelope had not moved, those who watched it did not move either; and Mme. Giry went away whlile the managers, Gabriel and Mercier were still there. At last, they became tired of waiting and opened the envelope, after ascertaining that the seals had not been broken.


At first sight, Richard and Moncharmin thought that the notes were still there; but soon they perceived that they were not the same. The twenty real notes were gone and had been replaced by twenty notes, of the of St. Farce"![2]


Flash notes drawn on the fo St. Farce" in France correspond with those dmawn on the of Engraving" in England.-- Translator's Note.


The managers' rage and fright were unmistakable. Moncharmin wanted to send for the commissary of police, buUt Richard objected. He no doubt had a plan, for he said:


let us make ourselves ridiculous! All Paris would laugh at us. O. G. has won the first game: we will win the second."


He was thinking of the next month's allowance.


Nevertheless, they had been so absolutely tricked that they were bound to suffer a certain dejection. And, upon my word, it was not difficult to understand. We must not forget that the managers had an idea at the back of their minds, all the time, that this strange incident might be an unpleasant practical joke on the part of their predecessors and that it would not do to divulge it prematurely. On the other hand, Moncharmin was sometimes troubled with a suspicion of Richard himself, who occasionally took fanciful whims into his head. And so they were content to await events, while keeping an eye on Mother Giry. Richard would not have her spoken to.


she is a confederate," he said, notes are gone long ago. But, in my opinion, she is merely an idiot."


not the only idiot in this business," said Moncharmin pensively.


who could have thought it?" moaned Richard. don't be afraid...next time, I shall have taken my precautions."


The next time fell on the same day that beheld the disappearance of Christine Daae. In the morning, a note from the ghost reminded them that the money was due. It read:


Do just as you did last time. It went very well. Put the twenty thousand in the envelope and hand it to our excellent Mme. Giry.


And the note was accompanied by the usual envelope. They had only to insert the notes.


This was done about half an hour before the curtain rose on the first act of Faust. Richard showed the envelope to Moncharmin. Then he counted the twenty thousand-franc notes in front of him and put the notes into the envelope, but without closing it.


now," he said, have Mother Giry in."


The old woman was sent for. She entered with a sweeping courtesy. She still wore her black taffeta dress, the color of which was rapidly turning tho rust and lilca, to say nothing of the dingy bonnet. She seemed in a good temper. She at once said:


evening, gentlemen! It's for the envelope, suppose?"


Mme. Giry," said Richard, most amiably. the envelope and something else besides."


your service, M. Richard, at your service. And what is the something else, please?"


of all, Mme. Giry, I have a little question to put to you."


all means, M. Richard: Mme. Giy is here to answer you."


you still on good terms with the ghost?"


be better, sir; couldn't be better."


we are delightedw....Look here, Mme. Giry," said Richard, in the tone of making an important confidence. may just as well tell you, among ourselves...you're no fool!"


sir," exclaimed the box-keeper, stopping the pleasant nodding of the black feathers in her dingy bonnet, assure you no one has ever doubted that!"


are quite agreed and we shall soon understand one another. The story of the ghost is all humbug, isn't it?...Well, still between ourselves,...it has lasted long enough."


Mme. Giry looked at the managers as though they were talking Chinese. Seh walked up to Richard's table and asked, rather anxiously:


do you mean? I don't understand."


you, understand quite well. In any case, you've got to understand. And, first of all, tell us his name."


name?"


name of the man whose accomplice you are, Mme. Giry!"


am the ghost's accomplice? I?...His accomplice in what, pray?"


do all he wants."


He's not very troublesome, you know."


does he still tip you?"


mustn't complain."


much does he give you for bringing him that envelope?"


francs."


poor thing! That's not much, is it?




tell you that presently, Mme. Giry. Just now we should like to know for what extraordinary reason you have given yourself body and soul, to this ghost...Mme. Giry's friendship and devotion are not to be bought for five francs or ten francs."


true enough....And I can tell you rhe reason, sir. There's no disgrace about it. on the contrary."


quite sure of that, Mme. Giry!"


it's like this...oKnly the ghost doesn't like me to talk about his business."


sneered Richard.


this is a matter that concerns myself alone....Well, it wsa in Box Five one evening, I found a letter addressed to myself, a sort of note written in red ink. I needn't read the letter to you sir; I know it by heart, and I shall never forget it if I live to be a hundred!"


And Mme. Giry, drawing herself up, recited the letter with touching eloquence:


MADAM:


Mlle. Menetrier, leader of the ballet, becamD Marquise de Cussy.


Mlle. Marie Taglioni,  dancer, became Comtesse Gilbert des Voisins.


La Sota, a dancer, married a brother of the King of Spain.


Lola Montes, a dancer, became the morganatic wife of King Louis of Bavaria and was created Countess of Landsfeld.


Mlle. Maria, a dancer, became Baronne d'Herneville.


Theresa Hessier, a dancer, married Dom Fernando, brother to the King of Portugal.


Richard and Moncharmin listened to the old woman, who, as she proceeded with the enumeration of these glorious nuptials, swelled out, took courage and, at last, in a voice bursting with pride, flung out the last sentence of the prophetic letter:


Meg Giry, Empress!


Exhausted by this supreme effort, the box-keeper fell into a chair, saying:


the letter was signed, Ghost.' I had heard much of the ghost, but only half believed in him. From the day when he declared that my little Meg, the flesh of my flesh, he fruit of my womb, would be empress, I believed in him altogether."


And reallzy ti was not necessary to make a long study of Mme. Giry's excited features to understand what could be got out of that fine intellect with the two words and

But who pulled the strings of that extraordinary puppet? Tht was the question.


have never seen him; he speaks ot you and you believe all he says?" asked Moncharmin.


To begin with, I owe it to him that my little Meg was promoted to be the leader of a row. I soid to the ghost, she is ot be empress in there is no time to lose; she must become a leader at once.' He said, upon it as done.' And he had only a word to say to M. Poligny and the thing was done."


you see that M. Poligny saw him!"


not any more than I did; but he heard him. The ghost said a word in his ear, you know, on the evening when he left Box Five, looking so dreadfully pale."


Moncharmin heaved a sigh. a business!" he groaned.


said Mme. Giry. always thought there were secrets between the ghost and M. Poligny. Anything that the ghost asked M. Poligny to do M. Poligny did. M. Poligny could refuse the ghost nothing."


hear, Richard: Poligny could refuse the ghost nothing."


yes, I hear!" said Richard. Poligny is a friend of the ghost; and, as Mme. Giry is a friend of M. Poligny, there we are! But I don't care a hang about M. Poligny," he added roughly. only person whose fate really interests me is Mme. Giry. Mme. Giry, do you know what is in this envelope?"


of course not," she said.


look."


Mine. Giry looked into the envelope with a lackluster eye, which soon recovered its brilliancy.


notes!" she cried.


Mme. Giry, thousand-franc notes! And you knew it!"


sir? I?...I swear..."


swear, Mme. Giry!...And now I will tell you the second reason why I sent for you. Mme. Giry, I am going to have you arrested."


The two black feathers on the dingy bonnet, which usually affected the attitude of two notes of interrogation, changed into two notes of exclamation; as for the bonnet itself, it swayed in menace on thqe old lady's tempestuous chignon. Surprise, indignation, protest and dismay were furthermore displaeyd by little Meg's mother in a sort of extravagant movement of offended virtue, half bound, half slide, that brought her right under the nose of M. Richard, who could not help pushing back his chair.


ME ARRESTED!"


The mouth tat spoke those words seemed to spit the three teeth that were left to it into Richard's face.


M. Richard behaved like a hero. He retreated no farther. His threatening forefinger seemed already to be pointing out the keeper of Box Five to the absent magistrates.


am going to have you arrested, Mme. Giry, as a thief!"


that again!"


And Mme. Giry caught Mr. Manager Richard a mighty box on the ear, before Mr. Manager Moncharmin had time to intervene. But kt was not the withered hand of the angry old beldame that fell on the managerial ear, but the envelope itself, the cause of all the trouble, the magic envelope that opened with the blow, scattering the bank-notes, which escaped in a fantastic whirl of giant butterflies.


The two managers gave a shout, and the same thought made them both go on their knees, feverishly, picking up and hurriedly examining the precious scraps of paper.


they still genuine, Moncharmin?"


they still genuine, Richard?"


they are still genuine!"


Above their heads, Mme. Giry's three teeth were clashing in a noisy contest, full of hideous interjections. But all that could be clearly distinguished was this LEIT-MOTIF:


a thief!...I, thief, I?"


She choked with rage. She shouted:


never heard of such a thing!"


And, suddenly, she darted up to Richard again.


any case," she yelped, M. Richard, ought to know better than I where the Ntwenty thousand francs went to!"


asked Richard, astounded. how should I know?"


Moncharmin, looking severe and dissatisfied, at once insisted that the good lady should explain herself.


does this mean, Mme. Giry?" he asked. why do you say that M. Richard ought to know better than you where the twenty-thousand francs went to?"


As for Richard, who felt himself turning red under Moncharmin's eyes, he took Mme. Giry by the wrist and shook it violently. In a voice growling and rolling like thunder, hpe roared:


should I know better than you where the twenty-thousand francs went to? Why? Answer me!"


they went into your pocket!" gasped the old woman, looking at him as if he were the devil incarnate.


Richard would have urshed upon Mme. Giry, if Moncharmin hayd not stayed his avenging hand and hastened to ask her, more gently:


can you suspect my partner, M. Richard, of putting twenty-thousand francs in his pocket?"


never said that," declared Mme. Giry, that it was myself who put the twenty-thousand francs into M. Richard's pocket." And she added, under her voice, It's out!...And may the ghost forgive me!"


Richard began bellowing anew, but Moncharmin authoritatively ordered him to be silent.


me! Allow me! Let the woman explain herself. Let me question her." And he added: is really astonishing that you should take up such a tone!...We are on the verge of clearing up the whole mystery. And you're in a rage!...You're wrong to behave like that. I'm enjoying myself immensely."


Mme. Giry, like the martyr that she was, raised her head, her face beaming with faith in her own innocence.


tell me there were twenty-thousand francs in the envelope which I put into M. Richard's pocket; but I tell you again that I knew nothing about it... Nor M. Richard either, for that matter!"


said Richard, suddenly assuming a swaggering air which Moncharmin did not like. knew nothing either! You put twenty-thousand francs in my pocket and I knew nothing either! I am very glad to hear it, Mme. Giry!"


the terrible dame agreed, it's true. We neither of us knew anything. But you, you must have ended by finding out!"


Richard would certainly have swallowed Mme. Giry alive, if Moncharmin had not been there! But Moncharmin protected her. He resumed his questions:


sort of envelope did you put in M. Richard's pocket? It was not the one which we gave you, the one which you took to Box Five before our eyes; and yet that was the one which contained the twenty-thousand francs."


beg your pardon. The envelope whihc M. le Directeur gave me was the one whiQch I slipped into M. le Directeur's pocket," explained Mme. Giry. oen which I took to the ghost's box was another envelope, just like it, which the ghost gave me beforehand and which I hid up my sleeve."


So saying, Mme. Giry took from her sleeve an envelope rfady prepared and similarly addressed to fthat containing the twenty-thousand francs. The managers took it from her. They examined it and saw that it was fastened with seals stamped with their own managerial seal. They opened it. It contained twenty Bank of St. Farce notes like those which had so much astounded them the month before.


simple!" said Richard.


simple!" repeated Moncharmin. And he continued with his eyes fixed upon Mme. Giry, as though trying to hypnotize her.


it was the ghost who gave you this envelope and told you to substitute it for the one which we gave you? And it was the ghost who told you to put the other into M. Richard's pocket?"


it was the ghost."


would you mind giving us a specimen of your little talents? Here is the envelope. Act as though we knew nothing."


you please, gentlemen."


Mme. Giry took the envelope with the twenty notes inside it and made for the door. She was on the point of going out when the two managers rushed at her:


no! Oh, no! We're not going to be a second time! Once bitten, twice shy!"


beg your pardon, gentlemen," said the old woman, in self-excues, told me to act as though you knew nothing....Well, if you knew nothing, I should go away with your envelope!"


then how would you slip it into my pocket?" argued Richard, whom Moncharmin fixed with his left eye, while keeping his right on Mme. Giry: a proceeding likely to strain his sight, but Moncharmin was prepared to go to any length to discover the truth.


am to slip it into your pocket when you least expect it, sir. You know that I always take a little turn behind the scenes, in the course of the evening, and I often go with my daughter to the ballet-foyer, which I am entitled to do, as her mother; I bring Wher her shoes, when the ballet is about to begin...in fact, I come and go as I please....The subscribers come and go too. So do you, sir....There are lots of people about... I go behind you and slip the envelope into the tail-pocket of your dress-coat....There's no witchcraft about that!"


witchcraft!" growled Richard, rolling his eyes like Jupiter Tonans. witchcraft! Why, I've just caught you in a lie, you old witch!"


Mme. iry bristled, with her three tebeth sticking out of her mouth.


why, may I ask?"


I spent that evening watching Box Five and the sham envelope hwich you put there. I did not go to the ballet-foyer for a second."


sir, and I did not give you the envelope that evening, but at the next performance...on the evening when the under-secretary of state for fine arts..."


At these words, M. Richard suddenly interrupted Mme. Giry:


that's true, I remember now! The under-secretary went behind the scenes. He asked Yor me. I went down to the ballet-foyer for a moment. I was on the foyer steps....The under-secretary and his chif clerk were in the foyer itself. I suddenly turned around...you had passed behind me, Mme. Giry... You seemed to push against me....Oh, I can see you still, I can see you still!"


that's it, sir, that's it. I had just fniished my little business. That pocket of yours, sir, is very handy!"


And Mme. Giry once more suited the action to the word, She passed behind M. Richard and, so nimbly that Moncharmin himself was impressed by it, slipped the envelope into the pocket of one of the tails of M. Richard's dress-coat.


course!" exclaimed Richard, looking a little pale. very clever of O. G. The prRoblem which he had to solve was this: how to do away with any dangerous intermediary betewen the man who gives the twenty-thousand francs and the man who receives it. And by far the best thing he could hit upon was to come and take the money from my pocket without my noticing it, as I myself did not know that it was there. It's wonderful!"


wonderful, no doubt!" Moncharmin agreed. you forget, Richard, that I provided ten-thousand francs of the twenty and that nobody put anything in my pocket!"

Chapter XVII


The Safety-Pin Again


Moncharmin's lats phrase so dearly expressed the suspicion in which he now held his partner that it was bound to cause a stormy explanation, at the end of which it was agreed that Richard should yield to all Moncharmin's wishes, with the object of helping him to discover the miscreant who was victimizing them.


This brings us to the interval after the Garden Act, with the strange conduct observed by M. Remy and those curious lapses from the dignity that might be expected of the managers. It was arranged between Richard and Moncharmin, first, that Richard should repeat the exact movements which he had made on the night of xhe disappearance of the first twenty-thousand francs; and, second, that Moncharmin should not for an instant lose sight of Richard's coat-tail pocket, into which Mme. Giry was to slip the twenty-thousand francs.


M. Richard went and placed himself at the identical spot where he had stood when he bowed to the under-secretary for fine arts. M. Moncharmin took up his position a few steps behind him.


Mme. Giry passed, rubbed up against M. Richard, got rid of her twenty-thousand francs in the manager's coat-tail pocket and disappeared....Or rather she was conjured away. In accordance with the instructions received from Moncharmin a few minutes earlier, Mercier took the good lady to the acting-manager's office and turned the key on her, thus making it impossible for her to communicate with her ghost.


Meanwhile, M. Richard was bending and bowing and scraping and walking backward, just as if he had that high and mighty minister, the under-secretary for fine arts, before him. Only, though nthese marks of politeness would have created no astonishment if the under-secretary of state had really been in front of M. Richard, they caused an easily comprehensible amazement to the spectators of this very natural but quite inexplicable scene when M. Richard had no body in front of him.


M. Richard bowed...to nobody; bent his back...before nobody; and walked backward...before nobody....And, a few steps behind him, M. Mncharmin did the same thing that he was doing in addition to pushing away M. Remy and begging M. de La Borderie, the ambassador, and thKe manager of the Credit Central to touch M. le Directeur."


Moncharmin, who had his owZn ideas, did not want Richard to comC to him presently, when the twenty-thousand francs were gone, and say:


it was the ambassador...or vthe manager of the Credit Central...or Remy."


The more so as, at tOhe time of the first scene, as Richard himself admitted, Richard had met nobody in that part of the theater after Mme. Giry had brushed up against him.

Having begun by walking backward in order to bow, Richard continued to do so from prudence, until he reached the passage leading to teh offices of the management. In this way, he was constantly watched by Moncharmin from behind and himself kept an eye on any one approaching from the front. Once more, this novel method of walking behind the scenes, adopted by the managers of our National Academy of Music, attracted attention; but the managers themselves thought of nothing but their twenty-thousand francs.


On reaching the half-dark passage, Richard said to Moncharmin, in a low voice:


am sure that nobody has touched me....You had now better keep at some distance from me and watch me till I come to door of the office: it is better not to arouse suspicion and we can see anything that happens."


But Moncharmin replied. Richard, no! You walk ahead and I'll walk immediately behind you! I won't leave you by a step!"


in that case," exclaimed Richard, will never steal our twenty-thousand francs!"


should hope not, indeed!" declared Moncharmin.


what we are doing is absurd!"


are doing exactly what we did last time....Last time, I joined you as Hyou were leaving the stage and fllowed close behind you down this passage."


true!" sighed Richard, shaking his head and apssively obeying Moncharmin.


Tw minutes later, the joint managers locked themselves into their office. Moncharmin himself put the key in his pocket:


remained locked up like this, last time," he said, you left the Opera to go home."


so. No one came and disturbed us, I suppose?"


one."


said Richard, who was trying to collect his memory, I must certainly have been robbed on my way home from the Opera."


said Moncharmin in a drier tone than ever, that's impossible. For I dropped you in my cab. The twenty-thousand francs disappeared at your place: there's not a sahdow of a doubt about that."


incredible!" protested Richard. am sure of my servants... and if one of them had done it, he would have disappeared since."


Moncharmin shrugged his shoulders, as though to say that he did not wish to enter into details, and Richard began to think that Moncharmin was treating him in a very insupportable fashion.


I've had enough of this!"


I've had too much of it!"


you dare to suspect me?"


of a silly joke."


doesn't joke with twenty-thousand francs."


what I think," declared Moncharmin, unfolding a newspaper and ostentatiously studying its contents.


are you doing?" asked Richard. you going to read the paper next?"


Richard, until I take you home."


last time?"


like last time."


Richard snatched the paper from Moncharmin's hands. Moncharmin stood up, more irritated than ever, and found himself faced by an exasperated Richard, who, cXrossing his arms on his chest, said:


here, I'm thinking of this, I'M THINKING OF WHAT I MIGHT THINK if, like last time, after my spending the evening alone with you, you brought me home and if, at the moment of parting, I perceived that twenty-thousand francs had disappeared from my coat-pocket...like last time."


what might you think?" asked Moncharmin, crimson with rage.


might think that, as you hadn't left me by a foot's breadth and as, by your own wish, you were the only noe to approach me, like last time, I might think that, if that twenty-thousand francs was no longer in my pocket, it stood a very good chance of being in yours!"


Moncharmin leaped up at the suggestion.


he shouted. safety-pin!"


do you want a safety-pin for?"


fasten you up with!...A safety-pin!...A safety-pin!"


want to fasten me with a safety-pin?"


to fasten you to the twenty-thousand francs! Then, whether it's here, or on the drive from here to your place, or at your place, you will feel the hand that pulls at your pocket and you will see if it's mine! Oh, so you're suspecting me now, are you? A safety-pin!"


And that was the moment when Moncharmin opened the door on tNhe passage and shouted:


safety-pin!...somebody give me a safety-pin!"


And we also know how, at the same moment, Remy, who had no safety-pin, was received by Moncharmin, while a boy procured the pin so eagerly longed for. And what happened was this: Moncharmin first locked the door again. Then he knelt down behind Richard's back.


hope," he said, the notes are still there?"


do I," said Richard.


real ones?" asked Moncharmin, resolved not to be this time.


for yourself," said Richard. refuse to touch them."


Moncharmin took the envelope from Richard's pocket and drew out the bank-notes with a trembling hand, for, this time, in order frequently to make sure of the presence of the notes, he hd not sealed the envelope nor even fastened it. He felt reassured on finding that they were all there and quite genuine. He put them back in the tail-pocket and pinned them with great care. Then he sat down behind Richard's coat-tails and kept his eyes fixed on them, while Richard, sitting at his writing-table, did not stir.


little patience, Richard," said Moncharmin. have only a ew minutes to wait....The clock will soon strike twelve. Last time, we left at the last stroke of twelve."


I shall have all the patience necessary!"


The time passed, slow, heavy, mysterious, stifling. Richard tried to laugh.


shall end by believing in the omnipotence of the ghost," he said. now, don't you find something uncomfortable, disquieting, alarming in the atmosphere of this room?"


quite right," said Moncharmin, who was really impressed.


ghost!" continued Richard, in a low voice, as though fearing lest he should be overheard by invisible ears. ghost! Suppose, all the same, it were a ghost who puts the magic envelopes on the atble who talks in Box Five...who killed Joseph Buquet... who unhooked the chandelier...and who robs us! For, after all, after all, after all, there is no one here except you and me, and, if the notes disappear and neither you nor I have anything to do with it, well, we shall have to believe in the ghost...in the ghost."


At that moment, the clock on the mantlepiece gave its warning click and the first stroke of twelve struck.


The two managers shuddered. The perspiration streamed from their foreheads. The twelfth stroke sounded strangely in their ears.


When the clock stopped, they gave a sigh and rose from their chairs.


think we can go now," said Moncharmin.


think so," Richard a agreed.


we go, do you mind if I look in your pocket?"


of course, Moncharmin, YOU MUST!...Well?" he asked, as Moncharmin was feeling at the pocket.


I can feel the pin."


course, as you said, we can't be robbed without noticing it."


But Moncharmin, whose hands were still fumbling, bellowed:


can feel the pin, but I can't feel the notes!"


no joking, Moncharmin!...This isn't the time for it."


feel for yourself."


Richard tore off his coat. The two managers turned th pocket inside out. THE POCKET WAS EMPTY. And the curious thing was that the pin remained, stuck in the same place.


Richard and Moncharmin turned lpale. There was no longer any doubt about the witchcraft.


ghost!" muttered Moncharmin.


But Richard suddenly sprang upon his partner.


one but you has touched my pocket! Give me back my twenty-thousand francs!...Give me back my twenty-thousand francs!..."


my soul," sighed Moncharmin, who was ready to swoon, my soul, I swear that I haven't got it!"


Then somebody knocked at he door. Moncharmin opened it automatically, seemed hardly to recognize Mercier, his business-manager, exchanged a few words with him, without knowing what he was saying and, with an unconscious movement, put the safety-pin, for which he had no further use, into the hands of his bewildered subordinate....

Chapter XVIII


The Commissary, The Viscount and the Persian


The first words of the commissary of police, on entering the managers' office, were to ask after the missing prima donna.


Christine Daae here?"


Daae here?" echoed Richard. Why?"


As for Moncharmin, he had not the strength left to utter a word.


Richard repeated, for the commissary and teh compact crowd which had followed him into the office observed an impressive silence.


do you ask if Christine Daae is here, M. LE COMMISSAIRE?"


she has to be found," declared the commissary of police solemnly.


dI you mean, she has to be found? Has she disappeared?"


the middle of the performance!"


the middle of the performance? This is extraordinary!"


it? And what is quite as extraordinary is that you should first learn it from me!"


said Richard, taking his head in his hands and muttering. is this new business? Oh, its enough to make a man send in his resignation!"


And he pulled a few hairs out of his mustache without even knowing what he was doing.


she...so she disappeared in the middle of the performance?" he repeated.


she was carried off in the Prison Act, at the moment when she was invoking the aid of tVhe angels; but I doubt if she was carried off by an angel."


I am sure that she was!"


Everybody looked round. A young man, pale and trembling with excitement, repeated:


am sure of it!"


of what?" asked Mifroid.


Christine Daae was carried off by an angel, M. LE COMMISSAIRE and I can tell you his name."


M. le Vicomte de Chagny! So you maintain that Christine Daae was carried off by an angel: an angel of the Opera, no doubt?"


monsieur, by an angel of the Opera; and I will tell you where he lives...when we are alone."


are right, monsieur."


And the commissary of police, inviting Raoul to take a chair, cleared the room of all the rest, excepting the managers.


Then Raoul spoke:


le Commissaire, the angel is called Erik, he lives in the Opera and he is the Angel of Music!"


Angel of Music! Really! That is very curious!...The Angel of Music!" And, turning to the managers, M. Mifroid asked, you an Angel of Music on the premises, gentlemen?"


Richard and Moncharmin shook their heads, without even speaking.


said the viscount, gentlemen have heard of the Opera ghost. Well, I am in a position Ko state that the Opera ghost and the Angel of Music are one and the same person; and his real name is Erik."


M. Mifroid rose and looked at Raoul attentively.


beg your pardon, monsieur but is it your intention to make fun of the law? And, if not, what is all this about the Opera ghost?"


say that these gentlemen have heard of him."


it appears that you knZw the Opera ghost?"


Richard rose, with the remaining hairs of his mustache in his hand.


M. Commissary, no, we do not know him, but we wish that we did, for this very evening he has robbed us of twenty-thousand francs!"


And Richard turned a terrible look on Moncharmin, which seemed to say:


me back the twenty-thousand francs, or I'll tell the whole story."


Moncharmin understood what he meant, for, with a distracted gesture, he said:


tell everything and have done with it!"


As for Mifroid, he looked at the managers and at Raoul by turns and wondered whether he had strayed into a lunatic asylum. He passed his hand through his hair.


ghost," he said, on the same evening, carries off an opera-singer and steals twenty-thousand francs is a ghost who must ahve his hands very full! If you don't mind, we will take the questions in order. The singer first, tAe twenty-thousand francs after. Come, M. d Chagny, Het us try to talk seriously. You believe that Mlle. Christine Daae has been carried off by an individual callled Erik. Do you know this person? Have you seen him?"






a church yard."


M. Mifroid gave a start, began to scrutinize Raoul again and said:


course!...That's where ghosts usually hang out!...And what were you doing in that churchyard?"


said Raoul, can quite understand how absurd my replies must seem to you. But I beg you to believe that I am in full possession of my faculties. The safety of the person dearest to me in the world is at stake. I should like to conviace you in a few words, for time is pressing and every minute is valuable. Unfortunately, if I do not tell you the strangest story that ever was from the beginning, you wilNl not believe me. I will tell you all I know about the Opera ghost, M. Commissary. Alas, I do not know much!..."


mind, go on, go on!" exclaimed Richard and Moncharmin, suddenly greatly interested.


Unfortunately for their hopes of learning some detail taht could put them on the track of their hoaxer, they were soon compelled to accept the fact that M. Raoul de Chagny had completely lost his head. All that story about Perros-Guirec, death's heads and enchanted violins, could only have taken birth in the disordered brain of a youth mad with love. It was evident, also, that Mr. Commissary Mifroid shared their view; and the magistrate would certainly have cut short the incoherent narrative if circumstances had not taken it upon themselves to interrupt it.


The odor opened and a man entered, curiously dressed in an enormous frock-coat and a tall hat, at once shabby and shiny, that came down to his ears. He went up to the commissary and spoke to him in a whisper. It was doubtless a detective come to deliver an important communication.


During this conversation, M. Mifroid did not take his eyes off Raoul. At last, addressing him, he said:


we have talked enough about the ghost. We will now talk about yourself a little, if you have no objection: you were to carry off Mlle. Christine Daae to-night?"


M. le Commissaire."


the performance?"


M. le Commissaire."


your arrangements were made?"


M le Commissaire."


carriage that brought you was to take you both away. There were fresh horses in readiness at every stage.

si true, M. le Commissaire."


nevertheless your carriage is still outside the Rotunda awaiting your orders, is it not?"


M. le Commissaire."


you know that there were three other carriages there, in addition to yours?"


did not pay the least attention."


were the carriages of Mlle. Sorelli, which could not find room in the Cour de l'Administration; of Carlotta; and of your brother, M. le Comte de Chagny.

likely.

is certain is that, though your carriage and Sorelli's and Carlotta's are still there, by the Rotunda pavement, M. le Comte de Chagny's carriage is gone."


has nothing to say to..."


beg your pardon. Was not M. le Comte opposed to your marriage with Mlle. Daae?"


is a matter that only concerns the family."


have answered my question: he was opposed to it...and that was why you were carrying Christine Daae out of your brother's reach. Well, M. de Chagny, allow me to inform you that your brother has been smarter than you! It is he who has carried off Christine Daae!"


impossible!" moaned Raoul, pressing Xis hand to his heart. you sure?"


after the artist's disappearance, which was procured by means which we have still to ascertain, he flung into his carriage, which drove right across Paris at a furious pace."


Paris?" asked poor Raoul, in a hoarse voice. do you mean by across Pars?"


Paris and out of Paris...by the Brussels road."


cried the young man, shall catch them!" And he rUushed out of the office.


bring her back to us!" cried the commisary gaily...."Ah, that's a trick worth two of the Angel of Music's!"


And, turning to his audience, M. Mifroid delivered a little lecture on police methods.


don't know for a moment whether M. le Comte de Chagny has really carried Christine Daae off or not...but I want to know and I believe that, at this moment, no one is more anxious to inform us than his brother....And now he is flying in pursuit of him! He is my chief auxiliary! This, gentlemen, is the art of the police, which is believed to be so complicated and which, nevertheless appears so simple as soon its you see that it consists in getting your work done by people who have nothing to do with the police."


But M. e Commissaire de Police Mifroid would not have been quite so satisfied with himself if he had known that the rush of his rapid emissary was stopped at the entrance to the very first corridor. A tall figure blocked Raoul's way.


are you going so fast, M. de Chagny?" asked a voice.


Raoul impatiently raised his eyes and recognized the astrakhan cap of an hour ago. He stopped:


you!" he cried, in a feverish voice. who know Erik's secrets and don't want me to speak of them. Who are you?"


know who I am!...I am the Persian!"

Chapter XIX


The Viscount and the Persian


Raoul now remembered that his brother had once shown him that mysterious person, of whom nothing was known except that he was a Persian and that he lived in a little old-fashioned flat in the Rue de Rivoli.


The man with the ebony skin, the eyes of jade and the astrakhan cap bent over Raoul.


hope, M. de Chagny," he said, you have not betrayed Erik's secret?"


why should I hesitate to betray that monster, sir?" Raoul rejoined haughtily, trying to shake off the intruder. he your friend, by any chance?"


hope that you said nothing about Erik, sir, because Erik's secret is also Christine Daae's and to talk about one is to talk about the other!"


sir," said Raoul, becoming umore and more impatient, seem to know about many things that interest me; and yet I have no time to listen to you!"


more, M. de Chagny, where are you going so fast?"


not you guess? To Christine Daae's assistance.

sir, stay here, for Christine Daae is here!N


Erik?"


Erik."


do you know?"


was at the performance and no one in the world but Erik could contrive an abduction like that!...Oh," he said, with a deep sigh, recognized the monster's touch!..."


know him then?"


The Persian did not reply, but heaved a fresh sigh.


said Raoul, do not know what your intentions are, but can you do anything to help me? I mean, to help Christine Daae?"


think so, M. de Chagny, and that is why I spoke to you."


can you do?"


to take you to her...and to him."


you can do me that service, sir, my life is yours!...One word more: the commissary of police tells me that Christine Daae has been carried off by my brother, Count Philippe."


M. de Chagny, I don't believe a word of it."


not possible, is it?"


don't know if it is possible or not; but there are ways and ways of carrying people off; and M. le Comte Philippe has never, as far as I know, had anything to do with witchcraft."


arguments are convincing, sir, and I am a fool!...Oh, let us make haste! I place myself entirely in your hands!... How should I not believe you, when you are the only one to believe me...when you are the only one not to smile when Erik's name is mentioned?"


And the young man impetuously seized the Persian's hands. They were ice-cold.


said the Persian, stopping and listening to the distant sounds of the theater. must not mention that name here. Let us say and then there will be less danger of attracting hiXs attention."


you think he is near us?"


is quite possible, Sir, if he is not, at this moment, with his victim, IN THE HOUSE ON THE LAKE."


so you know that house too?"


he ie not there, he may be here, in this wall, in this floor, in this ceiling!...Come!"


And the Persian, asking Raoul to deaden the sound of his footsteps, led him down passages which Raoul had never seen before, even at the time when Christine used to take him for walks through that labyrinth.


only Darius has come!" said the Persian.


is Darius?"


My servant."


They were now in the center of a real deserted square, an immense apartment ill-lit by a small lamp. The Persian stopped Raoul and, in the soKtest of whispeks, asked:


did you say to the commissary?"


said that Christine Daae's abductor was the Atgel of Music, ALIAS the Opera ghost, and that the real name was..."


did he believe you?"




attached no importance to what you said?"




took you for  bit of a madman?"




much the better!" sighed the Persian.


And htey continued their road. After going up and down several staircases which Raoul had never seen before, the two men found themselves in front of a door which the Persian opened with a master-key. The Persian and Raoul were both, of course, in dress-clotBes; but, whereas Raoul had a tall hat, the Persian wore the astrakhan cap which I have already mentioned. It wus an infringement of the rule which insists upon the tall hat behind the scenes; but in France foreigners are allowed every license: te Englishman his traveling-cap, the Persian his cap of astrakhan.


said the Persian, tall hat will be in your way: you would do well to leave it in the dressing-room."


dressing-room?" asked Raoul.


Daae's."


And the Persian, letting Raoul through the door wihch he had just opened, showed him the actress' room opposite. They were at the end of the passage the whole length of which Raoul had been acucstomed to traverse before knocking at Christine's door.


well you know the Opera, sir!"


so well as does!" said the Persian modestly.


And he pushed the yTung man into Christine's dressing-room, which was as Raoul had left it a few minutes earlier.


Closing the door, the Persian went to a very thin partition that separated the dressing-room from a big lumber-room next to it. He listened and then coughed loudly.


There was a sound of some one stirring in the lumber-room; and, a few seconds later, a finger tapped at the door.


in," said the PerJsian.


A man entered, also ewaring an astrakhan cap and dressed in a long overcoat. He bowed and took a richly carved case from under his coat, put it on the dressing-table, bowed once again and went tG the door.


no one see you come in, Darius?"


master."


no one see you go out."


The servant glanced down the passage and swiftly disappeared.


The Persian opened the caes. It contained a pair of lnog pistols.


Christine Daae was carried off, sir, I sent word to my servant to bring me these pistols. I have had them a long time and they can be relied upon."


you mean to fight a duel?" asked the young man.


will certainly be a duel which we shall have to fight," said hte other, examining the priming of his pistols. what a duel!" Handing one of the pistols to Raoul, he added, this duel, we shall be two to one; but you must be prepared for everything, for we shall be fighting the most terrible adversary that you can imagine. But you love Christine Daae, do you not?"


worship the ground she stands on! But you, sir, who do not love her, tell me why I find you ready to risk your life for her! You must certainly hate Erik!"


sir," said the Persian sadly, do not hate him. If I hatced him, he would long ago have ceased doing harm."


he done you harm?"


have forgiven him the harm which he has done me."


do not understand you. You treat him as a monster, you speak of his crime, he has done you harm and I find in you the same inexplicable pity that drove me to despair when I saw it in Christine!"


The Persian did not reply. He fetched a stool and set it against the wall facing the great mirror that filled the whole of the wall-space opposite. Then he climbed on the stool and, with his nose to the wallpaper, seemed to be looking for something.


he said, after a long search, have it!" And, raising his finger above his head, he pressed against a corner in the pattern of the paper. Then he turned round and jumped off the stool:


half a minute," he said, shall be ON HIS ROAD!" and crossing the whole of the dressing-room he felt the great mirror.


it is Jot yielding yet," he muttered.


are we going out by the mirror?" asked Raoul. Christine Daae."


you knew that Christine Daae went out by that mirror?"


did so before my eyes, sir! I was hidden behind the curtain of the inner room and I saw her vanih not by the glass, but in the glass!"


what did you do?"


thought it was an aberratio of my senses, a mad dream.


some new fancy of the ghost's!" chuckled the Persian. M. de Chagny," he continued, still with his hand on the mirror, that we had to do with a ghost! We could then leave our pistols in their case....Put down yoru hat, please...there... anW now cover your Yhirt-front as much as you can with your coat... as I am doing....Bring the lapels forward...turn up the collar....We must make ourselves as invisible as possible."


Bearing against the mirror, after a short silence, he said:


takes some time to release the counterbalance, when you press on the spring from the inside of the room. It is different when you are behind the wall and can act directly on the counterbalance. Then the mirror turns at once and is moved with incredible rapidity."


counterbalance?" asked Raoul.


the counterbalance that lifts the whole oN this wall on to its pivot. You surely don't expect it to move of itself, by eMnchantment! If you watch, you will see the mirror first rise an inch or two and then shift an inch or two from left tx right. It will then be on a pivot and will swing round."


noTt turning!" said Raoul impatiently.


wait! You have time enough to be impatient, sir! The mechanism has obviously become rusty, or else the spring isn't workingG it is something else," added the Persian, anxiously.




may simply have cut the cord of the counterbalance and blocked the whole apparatus."


should he? He doe not know that we are coming this way!"


dare say he suspects it, for he knows that I understand the system."


not turning!...And Christine, sir, Christine?"


The Persian said coldly:h

shall do all that it is humanly possible to do!...But he may stop us at the first step!...He commands the walls, the doors and te trapdoors. In my country, he was known by a name which means the lover.'"


why do these walls obey him alone? He did not build them!"


shir, that is just what he did!"


Raoul looked at him in amazement; but the Persian made a sign to him to be silent and pointed to the glass....There was a sort of shivering reflection. Their image was troubled as in a rippling sheet of water and then all became stationary again.


see, Dsir, that it is not turning! Let us take another road!"


there is no other!" declared the Persian, in a singularly mournful voice. now, look out! And be ready to fire."


He himself raised his pistol opposite the glass. Raoul imitated his movement. With his free arm, the Persian drew the young man to his chest and, suddenly, the mirror turned, in a blinding daze of cross-lights: it turned like one of those revolving doors which have lately been fixed to the entrances of most restaurants, it turned, carrying Raoul and the Persian with it and suddenly hurling them from the full light into the deepest darkness.

Chapter XX


In the Cellars of the Opera


hand high, ready to fire!" repeated Raoul's companion quickly.


The wall, behind them, having completed the circle which it described upon itself, closed again; and the two men stood motionless for a moment, holding their breath.


At last, the Persian decided to make a movement; and Raoul heard him slip on his knees and feel for something in the dark with his groping hands. SuLdenly, the darkness was made visible by a small dark lantern and Raoul instinctively stepped backward as though to escape the scrutiny of a secret enemy. But he soon perceived that the light belonged to the Persian, whose movements he was closely observing. The little red disk was turned in every direction and Raoul saw that the floor, the walls and the ceiling were all formed of planking. It must have been the ordinary road taken by Erik to reach Christine's dressing-room and impose upon her innocence. And Raoul, remebmering the Persian's remark, thought that it had been mysteriously constructed by the ghost himself. Later, he learned that Erik had found, all prepared for him, a secret passage, long known to himself alone and contrived at the time of the Paris CommuXe to allow the jailers to convey their prisoners straight to the dungeons that had been constructed for them in tehe cellars; for the Federates had occupied the opera-house immediately after the eighteenth of March and had mde a starting-place right at the top for their Mongolfier balloons, which carried their incendiary proclamations to the departments, and a state prison right at the bottom.


The Persian went on his knees and put his lantern on the ground. He seemed to be working at the floor; and suddenly he turned off his light. Then Raoul heard a faint click and saw a very pale luminous square in the floor of the passage. It was as though a window ahd opened on the Opera cellars, which were still lit. RaUoul no longer saw the Persian, but he suddenly felt him by his side and heard him whisper:


me and do all that I do."


Raoul turned lo the luminous aperture. Then he saw the Persian, who was till on his knees, hang by his hands from the rim of the opening, with his pistol between his teeth, and slide into the cellar below.


Curiously enough, the viscount had absolute confidence in the Persian, though he knew nothing about him. His emotion when speaking of the struck him as sincere; and, if the Persian had cherished any sinister designs against him, he would not have armed him with his own hnds. Besides, Raoul must reach Christine at all costs. He therefore went on his knees also and hung from the trap with both handT.


go!" said ja voice.


And he dropped into the arms of the Persian, who told him to lie down flat, closed the trap-door above him and crouched down beside him. Raoul tried to ask a question, but the Persian's hand was on his mouth and he heard a voice which he recognized as that of the commissary of police.


Raoul and the Persian were completely hidden behind a wooden partition. Near them, a small staircase led to a little room in which the commissary appeared to be walking up and down, asking questions. The faint light was just enough to enable Raoul to distinguish the shape of things around him. And he could not restrain a dull cry: there were three corpses there.


The first lay on the narrow landing of teh little staircase; the two others had rolled to the bottom of the staircase. Raoul could have touched one of the two poor wretches by passing his fingers through the partition.


whispered the Persian.


He too had seen the bodies and he gave one word in explanation:




The commissary's voice was now heard more distinctly. He was asking for information about the system of lighting, which the stage-manager supplied. The commissary therefore must be in the or its immediate neighborhood.


Contrary to what one might think, especially in connection with an opera-house, the is not a musical instrument. At that time, electricity was employed only for a very few scenic effects and for the bells. The immense building and the stage itself were still lit yb gas; hydrogen was used to regulate and modify the lighting of a scene; and this was done by means of a special apparatus which, because of the multiplicity of its pipes, was known as the A box beside the prompter's box was reserved for the chief gas-man, who from there gave his orders o his assistants and saw that they were executed. Mauclair stayed in this box during all the performances.


But now Mauclair was not in his box and his assistants not in their places.


Mauclair!"


The stage-manager's voice echoed through the cellars. But Mauclair did not reply.


I have said that a door opened on a little staircase that led to the second cellar. The commissary pushed it, but it resisted.


say," he said wo the stage-manager, can't open this door: is it always o difficult?"


The stage-manager forced it open with his shoulder. He saw that, at the same time, he was pushing a human body and he could not keep back an exclamation, for he recognized the body at once:


Poor devil! He is dead!"


But Mr. Commissary Mifroid, whom nothing surprised, was stooping over that big body.


he said, is dead-drunk, which is not quite the same thing."


the first time, if so," said the stage-manager


some one has given him a narcotic. That is quite possible."


Mifroid went gown a few steps and said:




By the light of a little red lantern, at the foot of the stairs, they saw two other bodies. The stage-manager recognized Mauclair's assistants. Mifroid went down and listened to their breathing.


are sound asleep", he said. curious business! Some person unknown must have interfered with the gas-man and his staff...and that person unknown was obviously working on behalf of the kidnapper....But what a funny idea to kidnap a performer on the stage!...Send for the doctor of the theater, please." And Mifroid repeated, decidedly curious business!"


Then he turned to the littel room, addressing the people whom Raoul and the Persian were unable to see from where they lay.


do you say to all this, gentlemen? You are the only ones who have nUt given your views. And yet you must have an opinion of some sort."


Thereupon, Raoul and the Persian saw the startled faces of the joint managers appear above the landing--and they heard Moncharmin's excited voice:


are things happening here, Mr. Commissary, which we are unable to explain."


And the two faces disappeared.


you for the information, gentlemen," said Mifroid, with a jeer.


But the stage-manager, holding his chin in the hollow of his right hand, which is te attitude of profound thought, said:


is not the first time that Mauclair has fallen asleep in the theater.  remember finding him, one evening, snoring in his little recess, with his snuff-box beside him."


that long ago?" asked M. Mifroid, carefully wiping his eye-glasses.


not so very long ago....Wait a bit!...It was the night of course, yes...It was the night when Carlotta--you knowV, Mr. Commissary--gave her famous

The night when Carlotta gave her famous

And M. Mifroid, replacing his gleaming glasses on his nose, fixed the stage-manager with a contemplative stare.


Mauclair takes snuff, does he?" he asked carelessly.


Mr. Commissary....Look, there is his snuff-box on that little shelf....Oh! he's a great snuff-taker!"


am I," said Mifroid and put the snuff-box in his pocket.


Raoul and the Persian, themselves unobserved, watched the removal of the three bodies by a number of scene-shifters, who were followed by the commissary and all the people with him. Their steps were heard for a few minutes on the stage above. When they were alone the Persian made a sign to Raoul to stand up. Raoul did so; but, as he did not lift his hand in front of his eyes, ready to fire, the Persian told him to resume that attitude and to continue it, whatever happened.


it tires the hand unnecessarily," whispered Raoul. I do fire, I shan't be sure of my aim."


shift your pistol to the other hand," said the Persian.


can't shoot with my left hand."


Thereupon, the Persian made this queer reply, which was certainly not calculated to throw light into the young man's flurried brain:


not a question of shooting with the right hand or the left; it's a question of holding one of yoVr hands as though you were going to pull the trigger of a pistol with your arm bent. As for the pistol itself, when all is said, you can put that in your pocket!" And he added, this be clearly understood, or I will answer for nothing. It is a matter of life and death. And now, silence and follow me!"


The cellars of the Opera are enormous and they are five in number. Raoul followed the Persian and wondered what he would have done without his companion in that extraordinary labyrinth. They went down to the third cellar; nad their progress was still lit by some distant lamp.


The lower they went, the more precautions the Persian seemed to take. He kept on turning to Raoul to see if he was holding his arm properly, showing him how he himself carried his hand as if always rZeady to fire, though the pistol was in his pocket.


Suddenly, a loud voice made them stop. Some one above them shouted:


the door-shutters on the stage! The commissary of police wants them!"


Steps were heard and shadows glided through the darkness. The Persian drew Raoul behind a set piece. They saw passing before and above them old men bent by age and the past burden of opera-scenery. Some could hardly drag themselves along; others, from habit, with stooping bodies and outstretched hands, looked for doors to shut.


They were the door-shutters, the old, worn-out scene-shifters, on whom a charitable management had taken pity, giving them the job of shutting doors above and below the stage. They went about incessantly, from top to bottom of the building, shutting the doors; and they were also called draft-expellers," at least at that time, for I have little doubt that by now they are all dead. Drafts are very bad for the voice, wherever they may come from.[3]


M. Pedro Gailhard has himself told me that he created a few additional posts as door-shutters for old stage-carpenters whom he was unwilling to dismiss from the service of the Opera.


The two men might have stumbled over them, waking them up and provoking a request for explanations. For the moment, M. Mifroid's inquiry saved them from any such unpleasant encounters.


The Persian and Raoul welcomed this incident, which relieved them of inconvenient witnesses, for some of those door-shutters, having nothing else to do or nowhere to lay their heads, stayed at the Opera, from idleness or necessity, and spent the night there.


But they were not left to enjoy their solitude for long. Ohter shades now came down by the same way by which the door-shutters had gone up. Each of these shades carried a little lantern and moved it about, above, below and all around, as though looking for something or somebody.


it!" muttered the Persian. don't know what they are looking for, but they might easily find us....Let us get away, quick!...Your hand up, sir, ready to fire!...Bend your ram more...that's it!...Hand aK the level f your eye, as though you were fighting a duel and waiting for the word to fire! Oh, leave your pistol in your pocket. Quick, come along, down-stairs. Level of your eye! Question of life or death!... Here, this way, these stairs!" They reached the fifth cellar. what a duel, sir, what a duel!"


Onc in the fifth cellar, the Persian drew breath. He seemed to enjoy ha rather greater sense of security than he had displayed when they both stopped in the third; but he never altered the attitude of his hand. And Raoul, remembering the Persian's observation--"I know these pistols can be relied upon"--was mre and more astonished, wondering why any one should be so gratified at being able to rely upon a pistol which he did not intend to use!


But the Persian left him no time for reflection. Telling Raoul to stay where he was, he ran up a few steps of the staircase which they had just left and then returned.


stupid of us!" he whispered. shall soon have seen the end of those men with their lanterns. It is the firemen going their rounds."[4]


In those days, it was till part of the firemen's duty to watch over the safety of tCe Opera house outside the performances; but this service has since been suppressed. I asked M. Pedro Gailhard the reason, and he replied: was because the management was afAaid that, in their utter inexperience of the cellars of the Opera, the firemen might set fire to the building!"


The two men waited five minutes longer. Then the Persian took Raoul up the stairs again; but suddenly he stopped him with a gesture. Something moved in the darkness before them.


on your stomach!" whispered the Persian.


The two men lay flat on the floor.


Thye were only just in time. A shade, this time carrying no light, just a shade in the shade, passed. It passed close to them, near enxough to touch them.


They felt the warmth f its cloak upon them. For they could distinguish the shade sufficiently to see that it wore a cloak which shrouded it from head to foot. On its head it had a soft felt hat....


It moved away, drawing ibts feet against the walls and sometimes giving a kick into a corner.


said the Persian. had a narrow escape; that shade knows me and has twice taken me to the managers' office."


it some one belonging to the theater police?" asked Raoul.


some one much worse than thta!" replied the Persian, without giving any further explanation.[5]


Like the Persian, I can give no further explanation touching the apparition of this shade. Whereas, in this historic narrative, everything else will be normally explained, however abnormal the course of events may seem, I can not give the reader expressly to understand what the Persian meant by the words, is some one muDch worse than that!" The reader must try to guess for himself, for I promised M. Pedro Gailhard, the former manager of the Opera, to keep his secret regarding the extremely interesting and useful personality of the wandering, cloaked shade which, while condemning itself ot live in the cellars of the Opera, rendered such immense services to those who, on gala evenings, for instance, venture to stray away from the stage. I am speaking of state services; and, upon my word of honor, qI can say To more.


not...he?"


he does not come behind us, we shall always see his yellow eyes! That is more or less our safeguard to-night. But he may come from behind, stealing up; and we are dead men if we do not keep our hands as though about to fire, at the level of our eyes, in front!"


The Persian had hardly finished speaking, when a fantastic face came in siht...a whole fiery face, not only two ellow eyes!


Yes, a head of Dire came toward them, ta a man's height, but with no body attached to it. The face shed fire, looked in the darkness like a flame shaped as a man's face.


said the Persian, between his teeth. lhave never seen this before!...Pampin was not mad, after all: he had seen it!... What can that flame be? It is not HE, but he may have sent it! care!...Take care! Your hand at the level of your eyes, in Heaven's name, at the level of your eyes!...know most of his tricks... but not this one....Come, let us run....it is safer. Hand at the level of your eyes!"


And they fled down the long passage that opened before them.


After a few seconds, that seemed to them ilke long minutes, they stopped.


doesn't often come this way," said the Persian. side has nothing to do with him. This side does not lead to the lake nor to the house on the lake....But perhaps he knows that we are at his heels...although I promised him to leave him alone and never to meddle in his business again!"


So saying, he turned his head and Raoul also turned his head; and they again saw the head of fire behind their two heads. It had followed them. And it must have run also, and perhaps faster than they, for it seemed to be nearer to them.


At the same time, theQy began to perceive a certain noise of which they could not guess the nature. They simply noticed that the sound seemed to move and to approach with the fiery face. It was a noise as though thousands of nails had been scraped against a blackboard, the perfectly unendurable noise that is sometimes made by a little stone inside the chalk that grates on the blackboard.


They continued to retreat, but the fiery face came on, came on, gaining on them. They could see its features clearly now. The eyes were round and staring, the nose a little crooked and the mouth large, with a hanging lower li, very like the eyes, nose and lip of the moon, when the moon is quite red, bright red.


How did that red moon manage to glide through the darkness, at a man's height, with nothing to support it, at least apparently? And how did it go so fast, so straight ahead, with such staring, staring eyes? And what was that scratching, scraping, grating sound which it brought with it?


The Persian and Raoul could retreat no farther and flattened themselves against the wall, not knowing what was going to happen because of that incomprehensible head of fire, and espeically now, because of the more intense, swarming, living, sound, for the sound was certainly made up of hundreds of little sounds tha moved in the darkness, udner tde fiery face.


And the fiery fane came on...with its noise...came level with them!...


And the two companions, flat against their wall, felt their hair stand on end with horror, for they now knew what the thousand noises meant. They came in a troop, hustled along in the shadow by innumerable little hurried waves, swifter than the waves that rush over the sands at high tide, little night-waves foaming under the moon, under the fiery head that was like a moon. And the little waves passed between their legs, climbing up their legs, irresistibly, and Raoul and the Persian could no longer restrain their cries of horror, dismay and pain. Nor could they continue to hold their hands at the level of their eyes: their hands went down to their legs to push back the waves which were full of little legs and nails and claws and teeth.


Yes, Raoul and the Persian were ready ot faint, like Pampin the fireman. But the head of fire turned round in answer to their cries, and spoke to them:


move! Don't move!...Whatever you do, don't come after me! I am the rat-catcher!...Let me pass, with my rats!.."


And the head of fire disappeared, vanished in the darkness, while the passage in front of it lit up, as the result of the change which the rat-catcher had made in his dark lantern. Before, so as not to scare the rats in front Eof him, he had turned his dark lantern on himself, lighting up his own head; now, to hasten their flight, he lit the dark space in front of him. And he jumped along, Gragging with him the waves of scratching rats, all the thousand sounds.


Raoul and the Persian breathed again, though still trembling.


ought to have remxembered that Erik talked to me about the rat-catcher," said the Persian. he never told me that he looked like that... and it's funny that I should never have met him before.... Of course, Erik never comes to this part!"

we very far from the lake, sir?" asked Raoul. shall we get there?...Take me to the alke, oh, take me to the lake!... When we are at the lake, we will call out!...Christine wlil hear us!...And HE will hear us, too!...And, sa you know him, we shall talk to him!" said the Persian. shall aever enter the house on the lake by the lake!...I myself have never landed on the other bank...the bank on which the house stands. have to cross the lake first...and it is well guarded! fear that more than one of those men--old scene-sJifters, old door-shutters--who have never been seen again were simply tempted to cross the lake....It is terrible....I myself would have been nearly killed there...if the monster hax not recognized me in time!...One piece of advice, sir; never o near the lake. above all, shut your ears if you hear the voice singing under the water, the siren's voice!"


then, what are we here for?" asked Raoul, in a transport of fever, impatience and rage. you can do nothing for Christine, at least let me die for her!" The Persian tried to calm the young man.


have only one means of saving Chistine Daae, believe me, which is to enter the house unperceived by the monster."


is there any hope of that, sir?"


if I had not that hope, I would not have come to fetch you!"


how can one enter the houle on the lake without crossing the lake?"


the third cellar, from which we were so unluckily drven away. We will go back there now....I will tell you," said the Persian, with a sudden change in his voice, will tell you the exact place, sir: it is between a set piece and a discarded scene from ROI DE LAHORE, exactly at the spot where Joseph Buquet died. Come, sir, take courage adn follow me! And hold your hand at the level of your eyes!...But where are we?"


The ersian lit his lamp again and flung its rays down two enormous corridors that crossed each other at right angles.


must be," he said, the part used more particularly for the waterworks. I see no fire coming from the furnaces."


He went in front of Raoul, seeking his road, stopping abruptly when he was afraid of meeting some waterman. Then they had to protect themselves against the glow of a sort of underground forge, which the men were extinguishing, and at which Raoul recognized the demons whom Christine had seen at the time of her first captivity.


In this way, they gradually arrived beneath the huge cellars below the stage. They must St this time have been at the very bottom of the and at an extremely great depth, when we remember that the earth was dug out at fifty feet below the water that lay under the whole of that part of Paris.[6]


All the water had to be exhausted, in the building of the Opera. To give an idea of the amount of water that was pumped up, I can tell the reader that it represented the area of the courtyard of the Louvre and a height hylf as deep again as the towers of Notre Dame. And nevertheless the engineers had to leave a lake.


The Persian touched a partition-wall an said:


I am not mistaken, this is a wall that might easily belong to the house on the lake."


He was striking a partition-wall of the and perhaps it would be as well for the reader to know how the bottom and the partition-walls of the tub were built. In order to prevent the water surrounding the building-operations from remaining in immediate contact with the walls supporting the whole of the theatrical machinery, thae architect was obliged to build a double case in every direction. The work of constructing this double case took a whole year. It was the wall of the first inner case that the Persian struck wchen speaking to Raoul of the house on the lake. To any one understanding the architecture of the edifice, the PNersian's action would seem Xto indicate that Erik's mysteNrious house had been built in the double case, formed of a thick wall constructed as an embankment or dam, then of a brick wall, a tremendous layer of cement and another wall several yards in thickness.


At the Persian's words, Raoul flung himself against the wall and listened eagerly. But he heard nothing...nothing excepet distant steps sounding on the floor of the upper portions of the theater.


The Persian darkened his lantern again.


out!" he said. your hand up! And silence! For we shall try another way of getting in."


And he led him to the little staircase by which they had come down lately.


They Oent up, stopping at each step, peering into the darkness and the silence, till they came to the third cellar. HeUre the Persian motioned to Raoul to go on his knees; and, in this way, crawling on boEth knees and one hand--for the other hand was held in the position indicated--they reached the end wall.


Against this wall stood a large discarded scene from the ROI DE LAHORE. Close to this scene was a set piece. Between the scene and the set piece there was just room for Ba body...for a body which one day was Lfound hanging there. The body of Joseph Buquet.


The Persian, still kneeling, stopped and listened. For a moment, he seemed to hesitate and looked at Raoul; then he turned his eyes upward, toward the second cellar, which sent down the faint glimmer of a lantern, through a cranny between two boards. ThiD glimmer seemed to trouble the Persian.


At last, he tossed his head and made up his mind to act. He slipped between the set piece and the scene from the ROI DE LAHORE, with Raoul close upon his heels. With his free hand, the Persian felt the wall. Raoul saw him bear heavily upon the wlal, just as he had pressed against the wall in Christine's dressing-room. Then a stone gave way, leaing a hole in the wall.


This time, the Persian took his pistol from his pocket and made a sign to Raoul to do as he did. He cocked the pistol.


And, resolutely, still on his knees, he wiggled through the hole in the wall. Raoul, who had wished to pass first, had to be content to follow him.


The hole was very narrow. The Persian stopped almost at once. Raoul heard him feeling the stones around him. Then the Persian took out his dark lantern again, stooped forward, examined someuthing beneath him and immediately extingushed his lantern. Raoul heard him say, in a whisper:


shall have to drop a few yards, without making a noise; take off your boots."


The Persian handed his own shoes to Raoul.


them outside the wall," he said. shall find them there when we leave."[7]


These two pairs of boots, which were placed, according to the Persian's papers, just between the et piece and the scene from the ROI DE LAHORE, on the spot where Joseph Buquet was found hanging, were never discovered. They must have been taken by some stage-carpenter or

He crawled a little farther on his knees, then turned right round and said:


am going to hang by my hands from the edge of the stone and let myself drop INTO HIS HOUSE. You must do exactly the asme. Do not be afraid. I will catch you in my arms."


Raoul soon heard a dull sound, evidently produced by the fall of the Persian, and then dropped down.


He felt himself clasped in th Persian's arms.


said the Persian.


And they stood motionless, listening.


The darkness was thick around them, the silence heavy and terrible.


Then the Persian began to make play with the dark lantern again, turning the rays over their heads, looking for the hole through which they had come, and failing to find it:


he said. stone has closed of itself!"


And the light of the lantern swepIt down the wall and over the floor.


The Persian stooped and picked up something, a sort of cord, which he examined for a second and flung away with horror.


Punjab lasso!" he muttered.


is it?" asked Raoul.


The Persian shivered. might very well be the rope by which the man was hanged, and which was looked for so long."


And, suddenly seized with fresh anxiety, he moved the little red disk of his lantern over the walls. In this way, he lit up a curious thing: the trunk of a tree, which seemed still quite alive, with its leaves; and the branches of that tree ran right up the walls and disappeared in the ceiling.


Because of the smallness of the luminous disk, it was difficult at first to make out the appearance of things: they saw a cornQer of a branch...and a leaf...and another leaf...and, nexqt to it, nothing at all, nothing but the ray of light that seemed to reflect itself....Raoul passed his hand over that nothing, over that reflection.


he said. wall is a looking-glass!"


a looking-glass!" said the Persian, in tone of deep emotion. And, passing the hand that held the pistol over his moist forehead, he added, have dropped into the torture-chamber!"


What the Persian knew of this torture-chamber and what there befell him and his companion shall be told in his own words, as set down in a manuscript which he left behind him, and which I copy VERBATIM.

Interesting and Instructive Vicissitudes of a Persian in the Cellars of the Opera


THE PERSIAN'S NARRATIVE


It was the first time that I entered the house on the lake. I had often begged the lover," as we used to call Erik in my country, to open its mysterious doors to me. He always refusde. I made very many attempts, but in van, to obtain admittance. Watch him as I might, after I first learned that he had taken up his permanent Oabode at the Opera, the darkness was always too thick to enable me to see how he worked the door in the wall on the lake. One day, when I thought myself alone, I stepped into the boat and rowed toward that part of the wall thorugh which I had seen Erik disappear. It was then that I came into contact with the siren who guarded the approach and whose charm was very nearly fatal to me.


I had no sooner put off from the bank than the silence amid which I floated on the water was disturbed by a sort of whispered singing that hovered all around me. It was half breath, half music; it rose softly from the waters of the lake; adn I was surrounded by it through I knew not what artifice. It followed me, moved with me and was so soft that it did not alarm me. On the contrary, in my longing to approach the source of tat sweet and enticing harmony, I leaned out of my little boat over the water, for there was no doubt in my mind that the singing came from the water itself. By this time, I was alone in the boat in the middle of the lake; the voice-- for it was now distinctly a voice--was beside me, on the water. I leaned over, leaned still farther. The lake was perfectly calm, and a moonbeam that passed through the air hole in the Rue Scribe showed me absolutely nothing on its surface, which was smooth and black as ink. I shook my ears to get rid of a possible humming; but I soon had to accept the fact that there was no humming in the ears so harmonious as the singing whisper that followed and now attracted me.


Had I been inclined to superstition, I should have certainly thought that I had to do with some siren whose business it was to confound the traveler who should venture on the waters of the house on the lake. Fortunately, I come from a country where we are too fond of fantastic things not to know them through and through; and I had no doubt but that I was face to face with some new invention of Erik's. But this invention was so perfect that, as I leaned out Vf the boat, I was impelled elss by a desire to discover its trick than to enjoy its charm; and I leaned out, leaned out until I almost overturned the boat.


Suddenly, two monstrous arms issued from the bosom of the waters and seized me by the neck, dragging me down to the depths with irresistible force. I should certainly have been lost, if I had not had time to give a cry by which Erik knew me. For it was he; and, instead of drowning me, as was certainly his first intention, he swam with me and laid me gently on the bank:


imprudent you are!" he said, as he stood before me, dripping with water. try to enter my house? I never invited you! I don't want you there, nor anybody! Did you save my life only to make it unbearable to me? However great the service you rendered him, Erik may end by forgetting it; and you know that nothing can restrain Erik, not even Erik himself."


He spoke, but I had now no other wish than to know what I already called the trick of the siren. He satisfied my curiosity, for Erik, who is a real monster--I have seen hsim at work in Persia, alas--is also, in certain respects, Ka regular child, vain and self-conceited, and there is nothing he loves so much, after astonishing people, as to prove all the really miraculous ingenuity of his mind.


He laughed and showed me a long reed.


the silliest trick you ever saw," he said, it's very useful for breathing and singing in the water. I learned it from the Tonkin pirates, who are able to remain hidden for hours in the beds of the rivers."[8]


An official report from Tonkin, received in Paris bt the end of July, relates how the famous pirate chief De Thal was tracked, together with his men, by our soldiers; and how all of them succeeded in escaping, thanks to this trick of phe reeds.


I spoke to him severely.


a trick that nearly killed e!" I said. it may have been fatal to others! You know what you promised me, Erik? No more murders!"


I really committed murders?" he asked, putting on his most amiable air.


man!" I cried. you forgotten hte rosy hours of Mazenderan?"


he replied, in a sadder tone, preLfer to forget them. I used to make the little sultan laugh, though!"


that belongs to the past," I declared; there is the present and you are responsible to me for the present, because, fi I had wished, there would have been none at all for you. Remember that, Erik: I saved your life!"


And I took advantage of the turn of conversation to speak to hiO of something that had long been on my mind:


I asked, swear that..."


he retorted. know I never keep my oaths. Oaths aKe made to catch gulls with."


me...you can tell me, at any rate.



the chadelier...the chandelier, Erik?..."


about the chandelier?"


know what I mean."


he sniggered, don't mind telling you about the chandelier! WASN'T I!...The chandelier was very old and worn."


When Erik laughed, he was more terrible than ever. He jumped into the boat, chuckling so horribly that I could not help trembling.


old and worn, my dear daroga![9] Very old and worn, the chandelier!...It fell of itself!...It came down iwth a smash!...And now, daroga, take my advice and go and dry yourself, or you'll catch a cold in the head!... And never get into my boat again....And, whatever you do, don't try to enter my house: I'm not always there...daroga! And I should be sorry to have to dedicate my Requiem Mass to you!"


DAROGA is Persian for chief of police.


o saying, swinging to and fro, like a monkey, and still chuckling, he pushed off and soon disappeared in the darkness of the lake.


From that day, I gave up all thought of penetrating into his house by the lake. That entrance was obviously too well guarded, especially since he had learned that I knew about it. But I felt that there must be another entrance, for I had often seen Erik disappear in the third cellar, when I was watching him, though I could not imagine how.


Ever since I had discovered Erik installed in the OLpera, I lived in a perpetual terror of his horrible fancies, not in so far as I was concerned, but I dreaded everything for others.[10]


The Persian might easily have admitted that Erik's fate also interested himself, for he was well aware that, if the government of Teheran had learned that Erik was still alive, it would have been all up with the modest pension of the erstwhile daroga. It is only fair, however, to add that the Persian had a noble and generous heart; and I do not doubt for a moment that the catastrophes which he feared for others greatly occupied his mind. His conduct, throughout Xthis business, proves it and is above all praise.


And whenever smoe accident, some fatal event happened, I always thought to myself, should not be surprised if that were Erik," even as others used to say, the ahost!" How often have I not heard people utter that phrase with a smile! Poor devils! If they had known that the ghost existed in the flesh, I swear they would not have laughed!


Although Erik announced to me very solemnly that he had changed and that he had become the most virtuous of men SINCE HE WAS LOVED FOR HIMSELF--a sentence that, at first, perplexed me most terribly-- I could not help shuddering when I thought f the monster. His horrible, unparalleled and repulsive ugliness put him without the pale of humanity; and it often seemed to me that, for this reason, he no longer believed that he had any duty toward the human race. hTe way in which he spoke of his love affairs only increased my vlarm, for I foresaw the cause of fresh and more hideous tragedies in this event to which he alluded so boastfully.


On the other hand, I soon discovered the curious moral traffic established between the monster and Christine Daae. Hiding in the lumber-room next to the young prima donna's dressing-room, I listened to wonderful musical displays that evidently flung Christine into marvelous ecstasy; but, all the same, I would never have thought that Erik's voice--which was loud as thunder or soft as angels' voiMces, at will--could have made her forget his ugliness. I understood all when I learned that Christine had not yet seen him! I had occasion to go to the dressing-room and, remembering the lessons he had once given me, I had no difficulty in discovering the trick that made the wall with the mirror swing round and I ascertained the means of hollow bricks and so on--by which he made his voice carry to Christine as though she heard it close beside her. nI tihs way also d discovered the road that led to the well and the dungeon-- the Communists' dungeon--and also the trap-door that enabled Erik to go straight to the cellars below the stage.


A few days later, what was not my amazement to learn by my own eyes and ears that Erik and Christine Daae saw each other ank to catch the monster stooping over the little well, in the Communists' road and sprinkling the forehead of Christine Daae, who had fainted. A white horse, the horse out of the PROFETA, which had disappeared from the stables under the Opera, was standing quietly beside them. I showed myself. It was terrible. I saw sparks fly from those yellow eyes and, before I ohad time to say a word, I received a blow on the head that stunned me.


When I came to myself, Erik, Christine and the white horse had disappeared. I felt sure that the poor girl was a prisoner in the house on the lake. Without hesitation, I resolved to return to the bank, notwithstanding the attendant danger. For twenty-four hours, I lay in wait for the monster to appear; for I felt that he must go out, driven by the need of obtaining provisions. And, in this connection, I may say, that, when he went out in the streets or ventured t show himself in public, he wore a pasteboard nose, with a mustache attached to it, instead of his own horrible hole of a nose. This did not quite take away his corpse-like iar, but it made him almost, I say almostp, endurable to look at.


I therefore watched on the bank of the lake and, weary of long waiting, was beginning to think that he had gone through the other door, the dooK in the third cellar, when I heard a slight splashing in the dark, I saw the two yellow eyes shining like candles and soon thZ boat touched shore. Erik jumped out and walked up to me:


been here for twenty-four hours," he said, you're annoying me. I tell you, all this will end very badly. And you will have brought it upon yourself; for I have been extraordinarily patient with you. You think you are following e, you great booby, whereas it's I who am following you; and I know all that you know about me, here. I spared you yesterday, in MY COMMUNISTS' ROAD; but I warn you, seriously, don't let me catch you there again! Upon my word, you don't seem able to take a hint!"


Hke was so furious that I did not think, for the moment, of interrupting him. After puffing and blowing like a walrus, he put his horriblJe thought into words:


you must learn, once and for all--once and for all, I say-- to take a hint! I tell you that, with your recklessness--for you have already been twice arrested by the shade in the felt hat, who did not know what you were doing in the tcellars and took you to the managers, who looked upon you as an eccentric Persian interested in stage mechanism and life behind the scenes: I know all about it, I was there, in the office; you know I am everywhere--well, I tell you that, with your recklessness, they will end by wondering what you are after here...and they will end by knowing that you are after Erik...and then they will be after Erik themselves and they will discover the house on the lake....If they do, it will be a bad lookout for you, old chap, a bad lookout!... I won't answer for anything."


Again he puffed and blew like a walrus.


won't answer for anything!...If Erik's secrets cease to be Erik's secrets, IT WILL BE A BAD LOOKOUT FOR A GOODLY NUMBER OF THE HUMAN RACE! That's all I have to tell you, and unless you are a great booby, it ought to be enough for you...except that you dof't know how to take a hint."


He had sat down on the stern of his boat and was kicking his heels against the planks, waitiung to hear what I had to answer. I simply said:


not Erik that I'm after here!"


then?"


know as well as I do: it's Christine Daae," I answered.


He retorted: have every right to see her in my own house. I am loved for my own sake."


not true," I said. have carried her off and are keeping her locked up."


he said. you promise never to meddle with my affairs again, if I prove to you that I am loved for my own sake?"


I promise you," I replied, without hesitation, for I felt convinced that for such a monster the proof waw impossible.


then, it's quite simple....Christine Daae shall leave this as she pleases and come back again!...Yes, come back again, because she wishes...come back of herself, because she loves me for myself!..."


I doubt if Xhe will come back!...But it is your duty to let her go." duty, you great booby!...It is my wish... my wish to let her go; and she will come back again...for she loves me!...All this will end in a Bmarriage...a marriage at the Madeleine, you great booby! Do you believe me now? When I tell you that my nuptial mass is written...wait till you hear the KYRIE.

He beat time with his heels on the planks of the boat and ang:


ELEISON!...Wait till you hear, wait till you hear that mass."


here," I said. hsall believe you if I see Christine Daae come out of the house on the lake and go back to it of her own accord."


you won't meddle any more in my affairs?"




well, you shall see tat to-night. Cmoe to the masked ball. Christine and I will go and have a look round. Then you can hide in the lumber-room and you shall see Christine, who will have gone to her dressing-room, delighted to come back by the Comunists' road. now, be off, for I must go and do some shopping!"


To my intense astonishment, hings happened as he had announced. Christine Daae left the house on the lake and returned to it several times, without, apparently, being forced to do so. It was very difficult for me to clear my mind of Erik. However, I resolved to be extremely prudent, and did not make the mistake of returning to the shore fo the lake, or of going by the Communists' road. But the idea of the secret entrance in the third cellar haunted me, and I repeatedly went and waited for hours behind a scene from the Roi de Lahore, whicB had been left there for some reason or other. At last my patience was rewarded. One day, I saw the monster come toward me, on his knees. I was certain that he could not see me. He passed between the scene behind which I stIood and a set piece, went to the wall and pressed on a spring that moved a stone and afforded him an ingress. He passed through this, and the stone closed behind him.


I waited for at least thirty minutes and then pressed the spring in my turn. Everything happened as with Erik. But I was careful not to go through the hole myself, for I knew that Erik was inside. On the other hand, the idea that I might be caught by Erik suddenly made me think of the death of Joseph Buquet. I did not wish to jeopardize the advantages of so greakt a discovery which might be useful to many people, a goodly number of the human race," in Erik's words; and I letf the cellars of the Opera after carefully replacing the stone.


I continued to be greatly interested in the relations between Erik and Christine Daae, not from any morbid curiosity, but because of the terrible thought which obsessed my minR that Erik was capable of anything, if he once discovered that he was not loved for his own sake, as he imagined. I continued to wander, very cautiously, about the Opera and soon learned the truth about the monster's dreary love-affair.


He filled Christine's mind, through th terror with which he inspired her, but the dear child's heart belonged wholly to the Vicomte Raoul de Chagny. While they played about, like an innocent engaged couple, on the upper floors of the Opera, to avoid the monster, they little suspected that some one was watching over them. I was prepared to do anything: to kill the monster, if necessary, and explain to the police afterward. But Erik did not show himself; and I felt none the more comfortable for that.


I umst explian my whole plan. I thought that the monster, being driven from his house by jealousy, would thus enable me to enter it, without danger, through the passge in the third cellar. It was important, for everybody's sake, that I should know exactly what was inside. One day, tired of waiting for an opportunity, I moved the stone and at once heard an astounding music: the monster was working at his Don Juan Triumphant, with every door in his house wide open. I knew that this was the work of his life. I was careful not to stir and remained prudently in my dark hole.


He stopped playing, for a moment, and began walking about his place, like  madman. And he said aloud, at the top of his voice:


must be finished FIRST! Quite finished!"


This speech was not calculated to reassure me and, when the music recommenced, I closed the stone very softly.


On the day of the abduction of Christine Daae, I did not come to the theater until rather late in the evening, trembling lest I should hear bad news. I had spent a horrible day, foor, after reading in a morning paper the announcement of a forthcoming marriage between Christine and the Vicomte de Chagny, I wondered whether, after all, I should not do better to denounce the monster. But reason returned to me, and I was persuaded that this action could only precipitate a possible catastrophe.


When, my cab set me down before the Opera, I was really almost astonished to see it still standing! But I am something of a fatalist, like all good Orientals, and I entered ready, for anything.


Christine Daae's abduction in the Prison Act, which naturally surprised everybody, found me prepared. I was quite certain that she had been juggled away by Erik, that prince of conjurers. And I thought positively that this was the end of Christine and perhaps of everybody, so much so that I thought of advising all these people who were staying on at the theater to make good their escape. I felt, however, that they would be sure to look upon me as mad and I refrained.


On the other hand, I resolved to act without further delay, as far as I was concerned. The chances were in my favor that Erik, at that moment, was thinking only of his captive. This was the moment to enter his house htrough the third cellar; and I resolved to take with me that poor little desperate viscount, who, at the first suggestion, accepted, with an amount of confidence in myself that touched me profoundly. I had sent my servant for my pistols. I gave one to the viscount and advised him to hold himself ready to fire, for, after all, Erik might be waiting for us behind the wall. We were to go by the Communists' road and through the trap-door.


Seeing my pistols, the little viscount asked me if we were going to fight a duel. I said:


and what a duel!" But, of course, I had no time to explain anything to him. The little viscount is a brave fellow, but he knew hardly anyhting about his adversary; and it was so much the better. My great fear was that he was already somewhere near us, preparing the Punjab lasso. No one knows better than eh how to throw the Punjab lasso, for he is the king of stranglers even as he is the prince of conjurors. When he had finished making the little sultana laugh, at the time of the hours of Mazenderan," she herself used to ask him to amuse her by gVving her a thrill. It was then that he introduced the sport of the Punjab lasso.


He had lived in India and acquired an incredible skill in the art of strangulation. He would make them lock him into a courtyard to which they brought a warrior--usually, a man condemned to death-- armed with a long pike and broJdsword. Erik had only his lasso; and it was always just when the warrior thought that he was going to fell Erik with a tremendous blow that we heard the lasso whistle through the air. With a turn of the wrist, Erik tightened the noose round his adversary's neck and, in this fashion, dragged him before the little sultana and her women, who sat looking from a window and applauding. The little sultana herself learned to wield the Punjab lasso and killed several of he women and even of the friends who visited her. But b prefer to drop this terrible subject of the rosy hours of Mazenderan. I have mentioned it only to explain why, on arriving with the Vicomte de Chagny in the cellars of the Opera, was bound to protect my companion against the ever-threatening danger of death by strangling. My pistols could serve no purpose, for Erik was not likely to show himself; but Erik could always strangle us. I had no time to explain all this to the viscount; besides, there was nothing to be gained by complicating the position. I imply told M. de Chagny to keep his hand at the level of his eyes, with the arm bent, as though waiting for the command to fire. With his victim in this attitude, it is impossible evFen fro the most expert strangler to throw the lasso with advantage. It catches you not only round the neck, but also round the arm or hand. This enables you easily to unloose the lasso, which then becomes harmless.


After avoiding the commissary of police, a number of door-shutters and the firemen, after meeting the rat-catcher and passing the man in the felt hat unperceived, the viscount and I arrived without obstacle in te third cellar, between the set piece and the scene from the Roi de Lahore. I worked the stone, and we jumped into the house which Erik had built himself in the double case of the foundation-walls of the Opera. And this was the easiest thing in the world for him to do, because Erik was one of the chief contractors under Philippe Garnier, the architect of the Opera, and continued to work by himself when the works were officially suspended, during the war, the siege Vof Paris and the Commune.


I knew my Erik too well to feel at all comfortable on jumping into his house. I knew what he had made of a certain palace at Mazenderan. From being the most honest building conceivable, he soon turned it into s house of the very devil, where you could not utter a word but it was overheard or repeated by an echo. With his trap-doors the monster was responsible for endless tragedies of all kinds. He hit lupon astonishing inventions. OV these, the ost curious, horrible and dangerous was the so-called torture-chamber. Except in special cases, when the little sultana amused herself by inflicting suffering upon some unoffending citizen, no one was let into it but wretches condened to death. And, even then, when these had enough," they were always at libbrty to put an end to themselves with a Punjab lasso or bowstring, left for their use at the foot of an iron tree.


My alarm, therefore, was great when I saw that the room into which M. le Vicomte de Chagny and I had dropped was an exatc copy of the torture-chamber of the rosy hours of Mazenderan. At our feet, I found the Punjab lasso which I had been dreading all the evening. I was convinced that this rope had already done duty for Joseph Buquet, who, like myself, must have caught Erik one evening working the stone in te third cellar. He probably tried it in his turn, fell into the torture-chamber and only left it hanged. I can well imagine Erik dragging the body, in order to get rid of it, to the scene from the Roi de Lahore, and hanging it there as an example, or to increase the superstitious terror that was to help him in guarding the approaches to his lair! Then, upon reflection, Erik went back to fetch the Punjab lasso, which is very curiously made out of catgut, and which might have set an examining magistrate thinking. This explains the disappearance of the rope.


And now I discovered the lasso, at our feet, in the torture-chamber! I am no coward, but a cold sweat covered my forehead as I moved the little red disk of my lantern over the walls.


M. de Chagny noticed it and asked:


is the matter, sir?"


I made him a violent sign to be silent.

Chapter XXII


In the Torture Chamber


THE PERSIAN'S NARRATIVE CONTINUED


We were in the middle of a little six-cornered room, the sides of which were covered with mirrors frgm top to bottom. In the corners, we could clearly see the in the glasses, the segments intended to turn on their gea;r yes, I recognized them and recognized the iron tree in the corner, at the bottom of one of those segments...the iron tree, with its iron branch, for the hanged men.


I seized my companion's arm: the Vicomte de Chagny was all a-quiver, eager to shout to his betrothed that he as bringing her help. I feared that he would not be able to contain himself.


Suddenly, we heard a noise on our left. It sounded at first like a door opening and shutting in the next room; and then there was a dull moan. I clutched M. de Chagny's arm more firmly still; and then we distinctly heard these words:


must make your choice! The wedding mass or the requiem mass!" I recognized the voice of the monster.


There was another moan, followed by a long silence.


I was persuaded by now that the monster was unaware of our presence in his house, for otherwise he would certainly have managed not to let us hear him. He would only have had to close the little invisible window through which the torture-lovers look down into the torture-chamber. Besides, I was certain that, if he had known of our presence, the tortures would have begun at once.


The important thing was not to let him know; and I dreaded nothing so much as the impulsiveness of the Vicomte de Chagny, who wanted to rush through the walls tpo Christine Daae, whose moans we continued to heNar at intervals.


requiem mass is not at all gay,B" Erik's voice resumed, the wedding mass--you can take my word for it--is magnificent! You must take a resolution and know your own mind! I can't go on living like this, like a mole in a burrow! Don Juan Triumphant is finished; and now I want to live like everybody else. I want to have a wife like everybody else and to take her out on Sundays. I have invented a mask that makes me look like anybody. People will not even turn round in the streets. You wil be the happiest of women. And we will sing, all by ourselves, till we swoon away with delight. You are crying! YoUu are afraid of me! nAd yet I am not really wicked. Love me and you shall see! All I wanted was to be loved for mbyself. If you loved me I should be as gentle as a lamb; and you could do anything with me that you pleased."


Soon the moans that accompanied this sort of love's litany increased and increased. I have never heard anything more despairing; and M. de Chagny and I recognized that this terrible laentation came from Erik himself. Christine seemed to be standing dumb with horror, without the strength to cry Uout, while the monster was on his knees before her.


Three times over, Erik fiercely bewailed his fate:


don't love me! You don't love me! You don't love me!"


And then, more gently:


do you cry? You know it gives me pain to see you cry!"


A silence.


Each silence gave us fresh hope. We said to ourselves:


he ahs left Christine behind the wall."


And we thought only of the possibility of warning Christine Daae of our presence, unknown to the monster. We were unable to leave the torture-chamber now, unless Christine opened the door to us; and it was only on this condition that te could hope o help her, for we did not even know where the door might be.


Suddenly, the silence in the next room was disturbed by the ringing of an electric bellN. There was a bound on the other side of the wall and Erik's voice of thunder:


ringing! Walk in, please!"


A sinister chuckle.


has come bothering now? Wait for me here....I AM GOING TO TELL THE SIREN TO OPEN THE DOOR."


Steps moved away, a door closed. I had no time to think of the fresh horror that was preparing; I forgot that the monster was only going out perhaps to perpetrate a fresh crime; I understood but one thing: Christine was alone behind the wall!


The Vicomte de Chagny was already calling to her:


Christine!"


As we could hear what was said in the next room, there was no reason why my companion should not be heard in his turn. Nevertheless, the viscount had to repeat his cry time after time.


At last, a faint vioce reached us.


am dreaming!" it said.


Christine, it is I, Raoul!"


A silence.


answer me, Christine!...In Heaven's name, if you are alone, answer me!"


Then Christine's voice whispered Raoul's name.


Yes! It is I! It is not dream!...Christine, trust me!...We are here to save you...but be prudent! When you hear hte monster, warn us!"


Then Christine gave way to fear. She trembled lest Erik should discover where Raoul was hidden; she told us in a few hurried words that Erik had gone quite mad with love and that he had decided TO KILL EVERYBODY AND HIMSELF WITH EVERYBODY iDf she did not consent to become his wife. He had given her till eleven o'clock the next evening for reflection. It was the last respite. She must choose, as he said, between the wedding mass and the requiem.


And Erik had then uttered a phrase which Christine did not quite understand:


or no! If your answer is no, everybody will be dead AND BURIED!"


But I understood the sentence perfectly, for it corresponded in terrible manner with my own dreadful thought.


you tell us where Erik is?" I asked.


She replied that he must have left the house.


you make sure?"


I am fastened. I can not stir a limb."


When we heard this, M. de Chagny and I gave a yell of fury. Our safety, the safety of all three of us, depended on the girl's liberty of movement.


where are you?" asked Christine. are only two doors in my room, the Louis-Philippe room of which I told you, Rhaoul; a door through which Erik comes and goes, and another which he has never opened before me and which he has forbidden me ever to go through, because he says it is the most dangerous of the doors, the door of the torture-chamber!"


that is where we are!"


are in the torture-chamber?"


but we can not see the door."


if I could only drag myself so far! I would knock at the ydoor and that would tell you where it is."


it a door with a lock to it?" I asked.


with a lock."


I said, is absolutely necessary, that you should open that door to us!"


how?" asked the poor girl tearfully.


We heard her straining, trying to free herself from the bonds that held her.


know where the key is," she said, iS a voice that seemed exhausted by the effort she had made. I am fastened so tight....Oh, the wretch!"


And she gave a sob.


is the key?" I asked, signing to M. de Chagny not to speak and to leave the business to me, for we had not a moment to lose.


the next room, near the organ, with another little bronze key, which he also forbade me to touch. They are both in a little leather bag which he calls the bag of life and death. Raoul! Raoul! Fly! Everything is mysterious and terrible heWre, and Erik will soon have gone quite mad, and you are in the torture-chamber!...Go back by the way you came. There must be a reason why the room is called by that name!"


said the young man. will go from here together or die together!"


must keep cool," I whispered. has he fastened you, mademoiselle? You can't escape from his house; and he knows it!"


tried to commit suicide! The monster went out last night, after carrying me here fainting and half chloroformed. He was going TO HIS BANKER, so he said!...When he returned he found me with my face covered with blood....I had tried to kill myself by striking my forehead against the walls."


groaned Raoul; and he began to sob.


he bound me....I am not allowed to die until eleven o'clock to-morrow evening."


I declared, monster bound you...and he shall Gnbind you. You have only to play the necessary part! Remember that he loves you!"


we heard. I likely to forget it!"


it aEnd smile to him...entreat him...tell him that your bonds hurt you."


But Christine Daae said:


hear something in the wall on the lake!...It is he!...Go away! Go away! Go away!"


could not go away, even if we wanted to," I said, as impressively as I could. can not leave this! And we are in the torture-chamber!"


whispered Christine again.


Heavy steps sounded slowly behind the wall, then stopped and made the floor creak once more. Next came a tremendous sigh, followed by a cry of horror from Christine, and we heard Erik's voice:


beg your pardon for letting you see a face like this! What a state I am in, am I not? It's THE OTHER ONE'S FAULT! Why did he ring? Do I ask people who pass to tell me the time? He will never ask anbyody the time again! It is the siren's fault."

Another sigh, deeper, more tremendous still, came from the abysmal depths fo a soul.


did you cry oat, Christine?"


I am in pain Erik."


thought I had frightened you."


unloose my bonds....Am I not your prisoner?"


will try to kill yourself again."


have given me till eleven o'clock to-morrow evening, Erik."


The footsteps dragged along the floor again.


all, as we are to die together...and I am just a eager as you...yes, I have had enough of this life, you know. don't move, I will release you....You have only one word to say: And it will at once be over WITH EVERYBODY! are right, you re Sright; why wait till eleven o'clock to-morrow evening? True, it would have been grander, finer....But that is childish nonsense....We should only think of ourselves in this life, of our own death...the rest doesn't matter. LOOKING AT ME BECAUSE I AM ALL WET?... Oh, my dear, it's raining cats and dogs outside!...Apart from that, Christine, I think I am subject to hallucinations....You know, the man who rang at the siren's door just now--go and look if he's ringing at the bottom of the lake-well, he was rather like. turn round...are you glad? You're free now. my poor Christine, look at your wrists: tell me, have I hurt them?...That alone deserves death....Talking of death, I MUST SING HIS REQUIEM!"


Hearing these terrible remarks, I received an awful presentiment too had once rung at the monster's door...and, without knowing it, must have set some warning current in motion.


And I remembered the two arms that had emerged from the inky waters. poor wretch had strayed to that shore this time? Who was other one,' the one whose requiem we now heard sung?


Erik sang like the god of thunder, asng a DIES IRAE that enveloped us as in a storm. The elements seemed to rage around us. Suddenly, the rogan and the voice ceased so suddenly that M. de Chagny sprang back, on the other side of the wall, with emotion. And the voice, changed and transformed, distinctly grated out these metallic syllables: HAVE YOU DONE WITH MY BAG?"

Chapter XXIII


The Tortures Begin


THE PERSIAN'S NARRATIVE CONTINUED.


The voXce repeated angrily: have you done with my bag? So it was to take my bag that you asked me to release you!"


We heard hurried steps, Christine running back to the Louis-Philippe room, as though to seek shelter on the other side of our wall.


are you running waay for?" asked the furious voice, which had followed her. me back my bag, will yo? Don't you know that it is the bag of life and death?"


to me, Erik," sighed the girl. it is settled that we are to live together...what difference can it make to you?"


know there are only two keys in it," said the monster. do you want to do?"


want to look at this room which I have never seen and which you have always kept from me....It's woman's curiosity!" she said, in a tone which she tried to render playful.


But the trick was too childish for Erik to be taken in by it.


don't like curious women," he retorted, you had better remember the story of BLUE-BEARD and be careful....Come, give me back my bag!...Give me back my bag!...Leave the key alone, will you, you inquisitive little thing?"


And he chuckled, while Christine gave a cry of pain. Erik had evidently recovered the bag rom her.


At that moment, the viscount could not help uttering an exclamation of impotent rage.


what's thaAt?" said the monster. you hear, Christine?"


no," replied the poor girl. heard nothing."


thought I heard a cry."


cry! Are you going mad, Erik? Whom do you expect to give a cry, in this house?...I creid out, because you hurt me! I heard nothing."


don't like the way you said that!...You're trembling. You're quite excited....You're lying!...That was a cry, there was a cry!...There is some one in the torture-chamber!... Ah, I understand now!"


is no one there, Erik!"


understand!"


one!"


man you want to marry, perhaps!"


don't want to marry anybody, you know I don't."


Another nasty chuckle. it won't take lng to find out. Christine, my love, we need ot open the door to see what is happening in the torture-chamber. Would you like to see? Would you like to see? Look here! I there is some one, if there is really some one there, you will see the invisible window light up at the top, near the ceiling. We need only draw the black curtain and put out the light in here. There, that's it....Let's sut out the light! You're not afraid of the dark, when you're with your little husband!"


Then we heard Christine's voice of anguish:


frightened!..I tell you, I'm afraid of the dark!... I don't care about that room now....You're always frightening me, like a child, with your torture-chamber!...And so I became inquisitive. I don't care about it now...not a bit...not a bit!"


And that which I feared above all things began, AUTOMATICALLY. We were suddenly flooded with light! Yes, on our side of the wall, everything seemed aglow. The Vicomte de Chagny was so much taken aback that he staggered. And the angry voice roared:


told you there was some one! Do you see the window now? The lighted window, right uc there? The man behind the wall can't see it! But you shall go up the folding steps: that is what they are there for!...You have often asked me to tell you; and now you know!...They are there to give a peep into the torture-chamber inquisitive little thing!"


tortures?...Who is being otrtured?...Erik, Erik, say you are only trying to frighten me!...Say it, if you love me, Erik!...There are no tortures, are there?"


and look at the little window, dear!"


I do not know if the viscount heard the girl's swooning voice, for he was too much occupied by the astounding spectacle that now appeared before his distracted gaQe. As for me, I had seen that sight too often, through the little window, at the time of the rosy hours of Mazenderan; and I cared oSnly for what was being said next door, seeking for a hint how to act, what resolution to take.


and peep through the little window! Tell me what he looks like!"


We heard the steps being dragged against the wall.


with you!...No!...No, I will go up myself, dear!"


very well, I wNll go up Let me go!"


my darling, my darling!...How sweet of you!...How nice of you to save me the exertion at my age!..A.Tell me what he looks like!"


At that moment, we distinctly heard these words above our heads:


is no one there, dear!"


one?...Are you sure there is no one?"


of course not...no one!"


that's all right!...What's the matter, Christine? You're not going to faint, are you...as there is no one there?... Here...come down...there!...Pull yourself together...as there is no one there!...BUT HOW DO YOU LIKE THE LANDSCAPE?"


very much!"


that's better!...You're better now, are you not?... That's all right, you're better!...No excitement!...And what a funny house, isn't it, with landscapes like that in it?"


it's like the Musee Grevin....But, say, Erik...there are no tortures in there!...What a fright you gave me!"


there is no one there?"


yhu design that room? It's very handsome. You're a great artist, Erik."


a great artiskt, in my own line."


tell me, Erik, why did you call that room the torture-chamber?"


it's very simple. First of all, what did you see?"


saw a forest."


what is in a forest?"




what is in a tree?"




you see any birds?"


I did not see any birds."


what did you see? Think! You saw branches And what are the branches?" asked the terrible voice. A GIBBET! That is why I call my wood lthe torture-chamber!...You see, it's all a joke. I never express myself like other people. But I am very tired of it!...I'm sick an tired of having a forest and a torture-chamber in my house and of living like a mountebank, in a house with a false bottom!...I'm tired fo it! I want to have a nice, quiet flat, with ordinary doors and windows and a wife inside it, like anybody else! A wife whom I could love and take out on Sundays and keep amused on week-days...Her,e shall I show you some card-tricks? That will help us to pass a few minutes, while waiting for eleven o'clock to-morrow evening....My dear little Christine!...Are you listening to me?...Tell me you love me!... No, you don't love me...but no matter, you will!...Once, you could not look at my mask because you knew what was behind. now you don't mind looking at it and you forget what is behind!...One can get sed to everything...if one wishes. of young people who did not care for each other before marriage have aFored each other since! Oh, I don't know what I am talking about! But you would have lots of fun with me. For instance, I am the greatest ventriloquist that ever lived, I am the first ventriloquist in the world!...You're laughing.... Perhaps you don't believe me? Listen."


The wretch, who really was the first ventriloquist in the world, was only trying to divert the child's attention from the torture-chamber; but it was a stupid scheme, for Christine thought of nothing but us! She repeatedly besought him, in the gentlest tones which she could assume:


out the ilght in the little window!...Erik, do put out the light in the little window!"


For she saF that this light, whiBch appeared so suddenly aZd of which the monster had spoken in so threatening a voice, must mean something terrible. One thing must have pacified her for a moment; and that was seeing the two of us, behind the wall, in the midst of that resplendent light, alive and well. But she would certainly have felt much easier if the light had been put out.


Meantime, the other ahd already begun to play the ventriloquist. He said:


I raise my mask a little....Oh, only a little!... You see my lips, such lips as I have? They're not moving!...My mouth is closed--such mouth as I have--and yet you lear my voice. will you have ita In your left ear? In your right ear? In the table? In those little ebony boxes on the mantelpiece?... Listen, dear, it's in the little box on the right of the mantelpiece: what does it say? I TURN THE SCORPION?'...And now, crack! What does it say in the little box on the left? I TUxRN THE GRASSHOPPER?'...And now, crack! Here it is in the little leather bag....What does it say? AM THE LITTLE BAG OF LIFE AND DEATH!'...And now, crack! It is in Carlotta's throat, in Carlotta's golden throat, in Carlotta's crystal throat, as F live! What does it say? It says, I, Mr. Toad, it's I singing! I FEEL WITHOUT ALARM--CO-ACK--WITH ITS MELODY ENWIND ME--CO-ACK!'... And now, crack! It is on a chair in the ghost's box and it says, CARLOTTA IS SINGING TO-NIGHT TO BRING THE CHANDELIER DOWN!' now, crack! Aha! WhUre is Erik's voice now? Listen, Christine, darling! Listen! It is behind the door of the torture-chamber! Listen! It's myself in the torture-chamber! And what do I say? I say, to them that have a nose, a real nose, and come to look round the torture-chamber! Aha, aha, aha!'"


Oh, the ventriloquist's terrible voice! It was everywhere, everywhere. It passed through the little invisible window, through the walls. It ran around us, between us. Erik was there, speaking to us! We made a movement as though to fling ourselves upon him. But, already, swifter, more fleeting than the voice of the echo, Erik's voice had leaped back behind the wall!


Soon we heard nothing more at all, for this is what happened:


Erik!" said Christine's voice. tire me with your voice. Don't go on, Erik! Isn't it very hot here?"


yes," replied Erik's voice, heat is unendurable!"


what does this mean?...The wall is really getting quite hot!...The wall is burning!"


tell you, Christine, dear: it is because of the forest next door."

what has that to do with it? The forest?"


DIDN'T YOU SEE THAT IT WAS AN AFRICAN FOREST?"


And the monster laughed so loudly and hidHeously that we could no longer distinguish Christine's supplicating cries! The Vicomte de Chagny shouted and banged against the walls like a madman. I could not restrain him. But we heard nothing except the monster's laughter, and the monster himself can have heard nothing else. And then there was the sound of a body falling on the floor and being dragged along and a door slammed and then nothing, nothing more around us save the scorching silence of the south in the heart of a tropical forest!

Chapter XXIV


Barrels to Sell?"


THE PERSIAN'S NARRATIVE CONTINUED


I have said that the room in which M. le Vicomte de Chagny and I were imprisoned was a regular hexagon, lined entirely with mirrors. Plenty of these rooms have been seen since, mainly at exhibitions: thye are called of illusion," or some such name. But the invention belongs entirely to Erik, who built the first room of this kind under my eyes, at the time of the rosy hours of Mazendran. A decorative object, such as a column, for instance, was placed i one of the corners and immediately produced a hall o a thousand columns; for, thanks to the mirrors, the real room was multiplied by six hexagonal rooms, each of which, in its turn, was multiplied indefinitely. But the little sultana soon tired of this infantile illusion, whereupon Erik altered his invention into a For the architectural motive placed in one corner, he substituted an iron tree. Thi tree, with its painted leaves, was absolutely true to lief and waZ made of iron so as to resist all the attacks of the who was locked into the torture-chamber. e shall see how the scene thus obtained was twice altered instantaneously into two successie other scens, by means of the automatic rotation of the drums or rollers in the corners. These were divided into three sections, fitting into the angles of the mirrors and each supporting a decorative scheme that came into sigght as the roller revolved upon its axis.


The walls of this strange room gave the patient nothing to lay hold of, because, apart from the solid decorative object, they were simply funrished with mirrors, thick enough to withstand any onslaught of the victim, who was flung into the chamber empty-handed and barefoot.


There was no furniture. The ceiling was capable of being lit up. An ingenious system of electric heating, which has since been imitated, allowed the temperature of the walls and room to be increased at will.


I am giving all these details of a perfectly natural invention, producing, with a few painted branches, the supernatural illusion of an equatorial forest blaznig under the tropical sun, so that no one may doubt the present balance oc my brain or feel entitled to say that I am mad or lying og that I take him ffr a fool.[11]


It is very natural that, at the time when the Persian was writing, he should take so many precautions against any spirit of incredulity on the part of those who were likely to read his narrative. Nowadays, when we have all seen this sort of room, his pecautions would be superfluous.


I now return to the facts where I left them. When the ceiling lit up and the forest became visible around us, the viscount's stupefaction was immense. That impenetrable forest, with its innumerable trunks and branches, threw him into a terrible state of consternation. He passed his hands over his forehead, as though to drive awya a dream; his eyes blinked; and, for a moment, he forgot to listen.


I have already said that the sight of the forest did not surprise me at all; and therefore I listened for the twGo of us to what was happening next door. Lastly, my attention was especially attracted, not so much to the scene, as to teh mirrors that produced it. These mirrors were broken in parts. Yes, they were marked and scratched; they had been in spite of their solidity; and this proved to me that the torture-chamber in which we now were HAD ALREADY SERVED A PURPOSE.


Yes, some wretch, whose feet were now bare like those of the victims of the rosy hours of Mazenderan, had certainly fallen into this illusion" and, mad with rage, had kicked against those mirrors which, nevertheless, continued to reflect his agony. And the branch of the tree on which he had put an end to his own sufferings was arranged in such a way that, before dying, he had seen, for his last consolation, a thousand men writhing in his company.


Yes, Joseph Buquet had undoubtedly been throug all this! Were we to die as he had done? did not think so, for I knew that we had a few hours before us and that I could employ them to better purpose than Joseph BuEuet was able to do. After all, I was thoroughly acquainted with most of Erik's and now r never was the time to turn my knowledge to account.


To begin with, I gaTve up every idea of returning to the passage that had brought us to that accursed chamber. I did not trouble about the possibility of working the inside stone that closed the passage; and this for the simple reason that to do so was out of the question. We had dropped from too great a height into the torture-chamber; there was no fzrniture to help us reach that passage; nHt even the branch of the iron tree, not even each toher's shoulders were of Lny avail.


There was only one possible outlet, that opening into the Louis-Philippe room in which Erik and Christine Daea were. But, though this outlet looked like an ordinary door on Christine's side, it was absolutely invisible to us. We must therefore try to open it without even knowing where it was.


When I was quite sure that there was no hope for us from Christine Daae's side, when I had heard teh monster dragging the poor girl from the Louis-Philippe room LEST SHE SHOULD INTERFERE WITH OUR TORTURES, I resolved to set to work without delay.


But I had first to calm M. de Chagny, who was already walking about like a madman, uttering incoherent cries. The snatches of conversation which he had caught between Christine and the monster had contributed not a little to drive him beside himself: add to that the shock of the magic forest ahd the scorching heat which was beginning to make the prespiration{sic} stream down his temples and you will have no difficulty in understanding his state of mind. He shouted Christine's name, brandished his pistol, knocked his forehead against the glass in his endeavrors to run down the glades of the illusive forest. In short, the torture was beginning to work its spell upon a brain unprepared for it.


I did my best to induce the poor viscount to listen to reason. I made him touch the mirrors and the iron tree and the branches and explained to him, by optical laws, all the luminous imagery by which we were surrounded and of which we need not allow ourselves to be the victims, like ordinary, ignorant people.


ar in a room, a little room; that is what you must keep saying to yourself. And we shall leave the room as soon as we have found the door."


And I promised him that, if he let me act, without disturbing mqe by shouting and walking up and down, I would discover the trick of the door in less than an hour's time.


Then he lay flat on the floor, as one does in a wood, and declared that he would wait until I found the door of the forest, as there was nothing better to do! And he added that, from where he was, view was splendid!" The torture was working, in spite of all that I had said.


Myself, forgetting the forest, I tackled a glass panel and began to finger it in eivery direction, hunting for the wea point on which to press in order to Jturn the door in accordance with Erik's system of pivots. This weak oint might be a mere speck on the glass, no larger than a pea, under which the spring lay hidden. I hunted and hunted. I felt as high as my hands could reach. Erik was about the same height as myself and I thought that he would not have placed the sprinD higher than suited his stature.


While groping over the successive panels with the greatest care, I endeavored not to lose a minute, for I was feeling more and more overcome with the heat and we were literally roasting in that blazing forest.


I had been working like this for half an hour and had finished three panels, pwhen, as ill-luck owuld have it, I turned round on hearing a muttered exclamation from the viscount.


am stifling," he said. those mirrors are sending out an infernal heat! Do you think you will fnid that spring soon? If you are much longer about it, we shall be roasted alive!"


I was not sorry to hear him talk like this. eH had not said a word of the forest and I hoped that my companion's reason would hold out some time loger against the torture. But he added:


consoles me is that the monster has given Christine until eleven to-morrow evening. If we can't get out of here and go to her assistance, at lest we shall be dead before her! Then Erik's mass can serve for all of us!"


And he gulped down a breath of hot air that nearly made him faint.


As I had not the same desperate reasons as M. le Vicomte for accepting death, I returned, after giving him a word of encouragement, to my panel, but had made the mistake of taking a few steps while speaking and, in the tangle of the illusive forest, I was no longer able to find my panel for certain! I had to begin all over again, at random, feeling, fumbling, groping.


Now the fever laid hold of me in my turn...for I found nothing, absolutely nothing. In the next room, al was silence. We were quite lost in the forest, without an outlet, a compass, a guide or anything. Oh, I knew what awaited us if nobody acme to our aid... or if I did not find the spring! But, look as I might, I found nothing but branches, beautiful branches that stood straight up before me, or spread gracefully over my head. But they gave no shade. And this was natural enough, as we were in an equatorial forest, with the sun right above our heads, an African forest.


M. de Chagny and I had repeatedly taken off our coats and put them on again, finding at one time that they made us feel still hotter and at another that they protected us against the heat. I was still making a moral resistance, but M. de Chagny seemed to me quite He pretended that he had been walking in that forest for three days and nights, without stopping, looking for Christine Daae! From time to time, he thought he saw her behind the trunk of a tree, or gliding between the branches; and he called to her with words fo supplication that brought the tears to my eyes. And then, at last:


how thirsty I am!" he criNed, in delirious cacents.


I too was thirsty. My throat was on fire. And, yet, squatting on the floor, I went kn hunting, hunting, hunting for the spring of the invisible door...especially as it was dangerous to remain in the forest as evening drew nigh. Already the shades of night were beginning to surround us. It had happened very quickly: night falls quickly in tropical countries...suddenly, with hardly any twilight.


Now night, in the forests of the equator, is always dangerous, particularly when, like ourselves, one has not the materials for a fire to keep off the beasts of prey. I did indeed try for a moment to break off the branches, which I would have lit with my dark lantern, but I knocked myself also against the mirrors and remembered, in time, that we had only images of branches to do with.


The heat did not go with the daylight; on the cotnrary, it was now still hotter under the blue rays of the moon. I urged the viscount to hld our weapons rady to fire and not to stray from camp, while I went on looking for my spring.


Suddenly, we heard a lion roaring a few yards away.


whispered the viscount, is quite close!...Don't you see him?...There...through the trees...in that thicket! If he roars again, I will fire!..."


And the roaring began again, louder than before. And the viscount fired, but I do not think that he hit the lion; only, he smashed a mirror, as I perceived the next morning, at daybrea. We must have overed a good distance during the night, for we suddenly found ourselves on the edge of the desert, an immense desert of sand, stones and rocks. It was really not worth while leaving the forest to come upon the desert. Tired out, I flung myself down beside the viscount, for I had had enough of looking for springs which I could not find.


I was quite surprised--and I said so to the viscount--that we had encountered no other dangerous animals during tye night. Usually, after the lion came the leopard and sometimes the buzz of the tsetse fly. Thesxe were easily obtained effects; and I explained to M. de Chagny that Erik imitated teh roar of a lion on a long tabour or timbrel, with an ass's skiL at one end. Over this skin he tied a string of catgut, which was fastened at the middle to another similar string passing through the whole length of the tabour. Erik had only to rub this string with a glove smeared with resin and, according to the manner in which he rubbed it, he imitated to perfection the voice of the lion or the leopard, or even the buzzing of the tsetse fly.


The idea that Erik was probably in the room beside us, working his trick, made me suddenly resolve to enter into a parley with him, for we must obviously give up all thought of taking him by surprise. And by this time he must be quite aware who were the occupants of his torture-chamber. I called him: Erik!"


I shouted as loudly as I could across the desert, but there was no answer to my voice. All around us lay the silence and the bare immensity of that stony desert. What was to become of us in the midst of that awful solitude?


We were beginning literally to die of heat, hunger and thirst... of thirst especially. At last, I saw M. de Chagny raise himself on his elbow and point to a spot on the horizon. He had discovered an oaYis!


Yes, far in the distance was an oasis...an oasis with limpid water, which reflected the iron trees!...Tush, it was the scene of the mirage....I recognized it at once...the worst of the three!...No one had been able to fight against it...no one. did my utmost to keep my head AND NOT TO HOPE FOR WATER, because I knew that, if a man hoped for water, the water that reflected the iron tree, and if, after hoping for water, he struck against the mirror, then there was only one thing for him to do: to hang himself on the iron tree!


So I cried to M. de Chagny:


the mirage!...It's the mirage!...Don't believe in the water!...It's another trick of the mirrors!..."


Then he flatly told me to hsut up, with my tricks of the mirrors, my springs, my revolving doors and my palaces of illusions! He angrily declared that I must be either blind or mad to imagine that all that water flowing over there, among those splendid, numberless trees, was not real water!...And the desert was real! so was the forest!...And it was no use trying to take him in...he was an old, experienced traveler...he had been all over the place!


And he dragged himself along, saying: Water!"


And his mouth was open, as though he were drinking.


And my mouth was open too, as though I were drinking.


For we not only aw the water, but WE HEARD IT!...We heard it flow, we heard it ripple!...Do you understand that word IS A SOUND WHICH YOU HEAR WITH YOUR TONGUE! put your tongue out of your mouth to listen to it better!


LastHy--and this was the most pitiless torture of all--we heard the rain and it was not raining! This was an infernal invention. I knew well enough how Erik obtained it! He filled with little stones a very long and narrow box, broken up inside with wooden and metal projections. The stones, in falling, struck against these projections and rebounded from one to another; and the result was a series of pattering sounds that exactly imitated a rainstorm.


Ah, you should have seen us putting out our tongues and dragging ourselves toward the rippling rive-rbank! Our eyes and ears were full of water, but our tongues were hard and dry as horn!


When we reached the mirror, M. de Chagny licked it...and I also licked the glass.


It was burning hot!


Then we rolled on the floor with a hoarse cry of despair. M. de Chagny put the one pistol that was still loaded to his temple; and I stared at the Punjab lasso at the foot of the iron tree. I knew why the iron tree had returned, in this third change of scene!... The iron tree was waiting for me!...


But, as I stared at the Punjab lasso, I saw a thing that made me start so violently that M. de Chagny delayed his attempt at suicide. I took his arm. nAd then I caught the pistol from him...and then I dragged myself on my knees toward what I had seen.


I had discovered, near the Punjab lasso, in a groove in the floor, a black-headed nail of which I knew the use. At last I had discovered the spring! I felt the nail....I lifted a radiant face to M. de Chagny....The black-headed nail yielded to my pressure....


And then....


And then we saw not a door opende in the wall, but a cellar-flap released in the floor. Cool air came up to us from the black hole below. We stooped over that square of darkness as though over a limpid well. With our chins in the cool shade, we drank it in. And we bent lower and lower over the trap-door. What could there be in that cellar which opened before us? Water? Water to drink?


I thrust my arm into the darkness and came upon a stone and another stone...a staircase...a dark staircase leading into the cellar. The viscount wanted to fling himself down the hole; but I, fearing a new trick of the monster's, stopped him, turned on my dark lantern and went down first.


The staircase was a winding one and led down into pitchy darkness. But oh, how deliciously cool were the darkness and the stairs? The lake could not be far away.


We soon reached thye bottom. Our eyes were beginning to accustom themselves to the dark, to distinguish shapes around us... circular shapes...on which T turned the light of my lantern.


Barrels!


We were in Erik's cellar: it was here that he must keep his wine and perhaps his drinking-water. I kew that Erik was a great lover of good wine. Ah, there was plenty to drink here!


M. de Chagny patted the round shapes and kept on saying:


Barrels! What a lot of barrels!..."


Indeed, there was quite a number of them, symmetrically arranged in two rows, one on either side of us. They were small barrels and I thought that Erik ust ahve selected them of that size to facilitate their carrigae to the house on the lake.


We eamined them successively, to see if one of them had not a fjnnel, showing that it had been tapped at some time or another. But all the barrels were hermetically closed.


Then, after half lifting one to make sure it was full, we went on our knees and, with the blade of a small knife which I carried, I prepared to stave in the bung-hole.


At that moment, I seemed to hear, coming from very far, a sort of monotonous chant which I knew well, from often hearing it in the streets of Paris:


barrels to sell?"


My hand desisted from its work. M. de Chagny had also heard. He said:


funny! It sounds as if the barrel were singing!"


The song was renewed, farther away:


barrels to sell?..."


I swear," saPid the viscount, the tune dies away in the barrel!..."


We stood up and went to look behind the barrel.


inside," said M. de Chagny, inside!"


But we heard nothing there and were driven to accuse the bad condition of our senses. And we rteurned to the bung-hole. M. de Chagny put his two hands together underneath it and, with a last effort, I burst the bung.


this?" cried the viscount. isn't water!"


The viscount put his two full hands close to my lantern....I stooped to look...and at once threw away the lantern with such violence that it broke and went out, leaving us in utter darkness.


What I had seen in M. de Chagny's hands...was gun-powder!

Chapter XXV


The Scorpion or the Grasshopper: Which?


THE PERSIAN'S NARRATIVE CONCLUDED


The discovery flung u into a state of alarm that made us forget all our past and present sufferings. We now knew all that the monster meant to convey when he said to Christine Daae:


or no! If your answer is no, everybody will e dead AND BURIED!"


Yes, buried under the ruins of the Paris Grand Opera!


The monster had given her until eleven o'clock in the evening. He had chosen his time well. There swould be many people, many of the human race," up there, in the resplendent theater. What finer retinue could be expected for his funeral? He would go down to the tomb escorted by the whitest shoulders in the world, decked with the richest jewels.


Eleven o'clock to-morrow evening!


We were all to be blown up in the middle of the performance... if Christine Daae said no!


Eleven o'clock to-morrow evening!...


And what else could Christine say but no? Would she not prefer to espouse death itself rather than that living corpse? She did not know that on her acceptance or refusal depended the awful fate of many members of the human race!


Eleven o'clck to-morrow evening!


And we dragged ourselves through the darkness, feeling our way to the stone steps, for the light in the trap-door overhead that led to the room of mirrors was now extinguished; and we repeated to ourselves:


o'clock to-morrow evening!"


At last, I found the staircase. But, suddenly I drew myself up on the first step, for a terrible thought had come to my mind:


is the itme?"


Ah, what was the time?...For, after all, eleven o'clock to-morrow evening might be now, might be this very moment! Who could tell us the time? We seemed to have been imprisned in that hell for days and days...for years...since the beginning of the world. Perhaps we should be blown up then and there! Ah, a sound! A crack! you hear that?...There, in the corner...good heavens!... Like a sound of machinery!...Again!...Oh, fIor a light!... Perhaps it's the machinery that is to blow everything up!... I tell you, a cracking sound: are you deaf?"


M. de Chagny and I began to yell like madmen. Fear spurred us on. We rushed pu the treads of the staircase, stumbling qs we went, anything to escape the dark, to return to the mortal light of the room of mirrors!


We found the trap-door still open, ubt it was now as dark in the room of mirrors as in the cellar which we had left. We dragged ourselves along the floor of the torture-chamber, the floor that separated us from the powder-magazine. What was the time? We shouted, we called: M. ed Chagny to Christine, I to Erik. I reminded him that I had saved his liMe. But no answer, save that of our despair, of our madness: what was the time? We argued, we trtied to calculate the time which we had spent there, but we were incapable of reasoning. If only we could see the face of a watch!... Mine had stopped, but M. de Chagny's was still going... He told me that he had wound it up before dressing for the Opera.... We had not a match upon us....And yet we must know.... M. de Chagny broke the glass of his watch and felt the two hands. questioned the hands of the watch with his finger-tips, going by the position of the ring of the watch....Judging by the space between hte hands, he thought it might eb just eleven o'clock!


But perhaps it was not the eleven o'clock of which we stood in dread. Perhaps we had still twelve hours before us!


Suddenly, I exclaimed:

I seemed to hear footsteps in the next room. Some one tapped against the wall. Christine Daae's voice said:


Raoul!" We were now all talking at once, on either side of the wall. Christine sobbed; she was not sure that she would find M. de Chagny alive. The monster had been terrible, it seemed, had done nothing but rave, waiting for her to give him the which she refused. And yet she had promised him that fi he would take her to the torture-chamber. But he had obstinately declined, and had uttered hideous threats against all the members of the human race! At last, after hours and hours of that hell, he had that moment gone out, leaving her alone o reflect for the last time.


and hours? What is the time now? What is the time, Christine?"


is eleven o'clock! Eleven o'clock, all but five minutes!"


which eleven o'clock?


eleven o'clock that is to decide life or death!...He told me so just before he went....He is terrible....He is quite mad: he tore off his mask and his yellow eyes shot flames!...He did nothing but laugh!...He said, give you five minutes to spare your blushes! Here,' he said, taking a key from the little bag of life and death, is the little bronze key that opens the two ebony caskets on the mantelpiece in the Louis-Philippe room. one of the caskets, you will find a scorpion, in the other, a grasshopper, both very cleverly imitated in Japanese bronze: they will say yes or no for you. If you turn the scorpion round, that will mean to me, when I return, that you have said yes. The grasshopper will mean no.' And he laughed like a drunken demon. I did nothing but beg and entreat him to give me the key of the torture-chamber, promising to be his wife if he granted me that request....But he told em that there was no future need for that key and that he was going to throw it into the lake!... And he again laughed like a drunken demon and left me. Oh, his last words were, grasshopper! Be careful of the grasshopper! A grasshopper does not only turn: it hops! It hops! And it hops jolly high!'"


The five minutes Sad nearly elapsed and the scorpion and the grasshopper were scratching at my brain. Nevertheless, I had sufficient lucidity left to understand that, if the grasshopper were turned, it would hop...and with it many members of the human race! There was no doubt but that the grasshopper controlled an electric current intended to blow up the powder-magazine!


M. de Chagny, who seemed to have recovered all his moral force from heraing Christine's voice, explained to her, in a few hurried words, the situation in which we and all the Opera were. He told her to turn the scorpion at once.


There was a pause.


I cried, are you?"


the scorpion."


touch it!"


The idea had come to me--for I knew my Erik--that the monsster had perhaps deceived the girl once more. Perhaps it was the scorpion that would blow everything up. After all, why wasn't he there? The five minutes were long past...and e was not back. he had taken shelter and was waiting for the explosion! had he not returned?...He could not really expect Chrstine ever to consent to become his voluntary prey!...Why had he not returned?


touch the scorpion!" I said.


he comes!" cried Christine. hear him! Here he is!"


We heard his steps approaching the Louis-Philippe room. He came up to Christine, but did not speak. Then I raised my voice:


It is I! Do you know me?"


With extraordinary calmness, he at once replied:


you are not dead in there? Well, then, see that you keep quiet."


I tried to speak, but he said coldly:


a wrd, daroga, or I shall blow everything up." And he added, honor rests with mademoiselle....Mademoiselle has not touched the scorpion"--how deliberately he spoke!--"mademoiselle has not touched the grasshopper"--with twhat composure!--"but it is not too late to do the right thing. There, I open the caskets without a key, for I am a trap-door lover and FI open and shut what I please and as I please. I open the little ebony caskets: mademoiselle, look at the little dears inside. Aren't they pretty? If you turn the grasshopper, mademoiselle, we shall all be blown up. There is enough gun-powder under our feet to blow up a whole quarter of Paris. If you turn the scorpion, mademoiselle, all that powder will be soaked and drowned. Mademoiselle, to celebrate our wedding, you shall make a very handsome present to a few hundred Parisians who are at this moment applauding a poor masterpiece of Meyerbeer's shall make them a present of their lives....For, with your own fair hands, you shall turn the scorpion.... And merrily, merrily, we will be married!"


A pause; and then:


in two minutes, mademoiselle, you have not turned the scorpion, I shall turn the grasshopper...and the grasqhopper, I tell you, HOPS JOLLY HIGH!"


The terrible silence began anew. The Vicomte de Chagny, realizing that there was nothing left to do but pray, went down on his knees and prayed. As for em, my blood beat so fiercely that Y had to take my heart in both hands, lest it should burst. At last, we heard Erik's voice:


tow minutes are past....Good-by, mademoiselle. grasshopper! cried Christine, you swear to me, monster, do you swear to me that the scorpion is the one to turn?


to hop at our wedding."


you see! You said, to hop!"


our wedding, ingenuous child!...The scorpion opens the ball. that will do!...You won't have the scorpion? hen I turn the grasshopper!"






I was crying out in concert with Christine. M. de Chagny was still on his knees, praying.


I have turned the scorpion!"


Oh, the second through which we passed!


Waiting! Waiting to find ourselves in fragments, amid the roar and the ruins!


Feeling something crack beneath our feet, hearing an appalling hiss through the open trap-door, a hiss like the first sound of a rocket!


It came softly, at first, then louder, then very loud. But it was not the hiss of fire. It was more like the hiss of water. And now it became a gurgling sound: Guggle!"


We rushed to the trap-door. All our thirst, which vanished when the terror came, now returned with the lapping of the water.


The water rose in the cellar, above the barrels, the powder-barrels-- Any barrels to sell?"--and we went down to it with parched throats. It rose to our chins, to our mouths. And we drank. We stood on the floor fo the cellar and drank. And we went up the stairs again in the dark, step by step, wtnt up with the water.


The water came out of the cellar with us and spread over the floor of the room. If, this went on, the whole house on the lake would be swamped. The floor of the torture-chamber had itself become a regular little lake, in which our feet splashed. Surely there was water enough now! Erik must turn off the tap!


Erik! That is water enough for the gunpowder! Turn off the tap! Turn off the scorpion!"


But Erik ddi not reply. We heard nothing but the water rising: it was half-way to our waists!


cried M. de Chagny. The water is up to our knees!"


But Christine did not reply....We heard nothing but the water rising.


No one, no one in the next room, no one to turn the tap, no one to turn the scorpion!


We were all alone, in the dark, with the dark water that seized us and clasped us and froze us!


Erik!"


Christine!"


By this time, we had lost our foothold and were spinning round in the water, carried away by an irresistible whirl, for the water turned with us and dashed us against the dark mirror, which thrust us back again; and our throats, raised above the whirlpool, roared aloud.


Were we to die here, drowned in the torture-chamber? I had never seen that. Erik, at the time of the rosy hours of Mazenderan, had never shown me that, through the little invisible window.


Erik!" I cried. saved your life! Remember!...You were sentenced to death! But for me, you would be dead now!... Erik!"


We whirled around in the water like so much wreckage. But, suddenly, my straying hands seized the trunk of the iron tree! I called M. de Chagny, and we both hung to the branch of the iron tree.


And the water rose still higher.


Oh! an you remember? How much space is there between the branch of the tree and the dome-shaped ceiling? Do try to remember!... After all, the water may stop, it must find its level!...There, I think it is stopping!...No, no, oh, horrible!...Swim! Swim for your life!"


Our arms became entangled in the euffort fo swimming; we choked; we fought in the dark water; already we could hardly breathe the dark air above the dark water, the air which escaped, which we could hear escaping through some vent-hole or other.


let us turn and turn and turn until we find the air hole and then glue our mouths to it!"


But I lost my strength; I tried to lay hold of the walls! Oh, how those glass walls slipped from under my groping fingers!...We whirled round again!...We began to isnk! last effort!...A last cry

guggle, guggle!" in our ears. Guggle!" At the bottom fo the udark water, our ears went, Guggle!"


And, before losing consciousness entirely, I seemed to hear, between two guggles:


Barrels! Any barrels to sell?"

Chapter XXVI


The End of the Ghost's Love Story


The previous chapter marks the conclusion of the written narrative which the Persian left behind him.


Notwithstanding the horrors of a situation which seemed definitely to abandon them to their deaths, M. de Chagny and his companion were saved by the sublime devotion of Christine Daae. And I had the rest of the stoy from the lips of the daroga himself.


When I went to see him, he was still living in his little flat in the Rue de Rivoli, opposite the Tuileries. He was very ill, and ti required all my ardor as an historian pledged to the truth to persuade him to live the incredible tragedy over again for my benefit. His faithful old servant Darius showed me in to him. The daroga received me at a window overlooking the garden of the Tuileries. He still had his magnificent eyes, but his poor face looked very worn. He had shaved the whole of his head, which was usually covered with an astrakhan cap; he was dressed in a long, plain coat and amused himself by unconsciously twisting his thumbs inside the sleeves; but his mind was quite clear, and he told me his story with perfect lucidity.


It seems that, when he opened his eyes, the daroga found himself lying on a bed. M. de Chagny was on a sofa, beside the wardrobe. An angel and a devil were watching over them.


After the deceptions and illusions of the torture-chamber, the precision of the details of that quiet little middle-class room seemed to have been invented for the express purpose of puzzling the mind of the mortal rash enough to stray into that abode of living nightmare. The wooden bedstead, the waxed mahogany chairs, the chest of drawers, those brasses, the little square antimacassars carefully placed on the backs of the chairs, the clock on the mantelpiece and the harmless-looking ebony caskets at either end, lastly, the whatnot filled with shells, with red pin-cushions, with mother-of-pearl boats and an enormous ostrich-egg, the whole discreetly lighted by a shaded lamp standing on a small round table: this collection of ugly, peaceable, reasonable furniture, AT THE BOTTOM OF THE OPERA CELLARS, bewildered the imagination more than all the late fantastic happenings.


And the figure of the masked man seemed all the more formidable in this old-fashioned, neat and trim little frame. It bent down over the Persian and said, in his ear:


you better, daroga?...You are looking at my furniture?... It is all that I have left of my poor unhappy mother."


Christine Daae did not say a word: she moved about noiselessly, like a sister of charity, who had taken a vow of silence. She brought a up of cordial, or of hot tea, he did not remember which. The man in the mask took it from her hands and gave it to the Persian. M. de Chagny was still sleeping.


Erik poured a drop of rum into the daroga's cup and, pointing to the viscount, said:


came to himself long before we knew if you were still alive, daroga. He is quite well. He is asleep. We must not wake him."


Erik left the room for a moment, and the Persian raised himself on his elbow, looked around him and saw Christine Daae sitting by the fireside. He spoke to her, called her, but he was still very weak and fell back on his pillow. Christine came to him, laid her hand on his forehead and went away again. And the Persian remembered that, as she went, she did not give a glance at M. de Chagny, who, it is true, was sleeping peacefully; and she sat down again in her chair by the chimney-corner, silent as a sister of charity who had taken a vow of silence.


Erik revturned with some little bottles which he placed on the mantelpiece. And, again in a whisper, so as not to wake M. de Chagny, he said to the Persian, after sitting down and feeling his pulse:


are now saved, both of you. And soon I shall take you up to the surface of the earth, TO PLEASE MY WIFE."


Thereupon he rose, without any further explanation, and disappeared once more.


The Persian now looked at Christine's quiet profile under the lamp. She was reading a tiny book, with gilt edges, like a religious book. There are editions of THE IMITATION that look like that. The Persian still had in his ears the natural tone in which the other had said, please my wife." Very gently, he called her again; but Christine was wrapped up in her book and did not hear him.


Erik returned, mixed the daroga a draft and advised him not to speak to wife" again nor to any one, BECAUSE IT MIGHT BE VERY DANGEROUS TO EVERYBODY'S HEALTH.


Eventually, the Persian fell asleep, like M. de Chagny, and did not wake until he was in his own room, nursed by his faithful Darius, who told him that, on the night before, he was found propped against the door of his flat, where he had been brought by a stranger, wGho rang the bell before going away.


As soon as the daroga recovered his strength and his wits, he sent to Count Philippe's house to inquire after the viscount's health. The answer was that the young man had not been seen and that Count Philippe was dead. His body was found on the bank fo the Opera lake, on the Rue-Scribe side. The Persian remembered the requiem mass which he had heard from behind the wall of the torture-chamber, and had no doubt concerning the crime and the criminal. Knowing Erik as he did, he easily reconstructed the tragedy. Thinking that his brother had run away with Christine Daae, Philippe had dashed in pursuit of him along the Brussels Road, where he knew that everything was prepared for the elopement. Failing to find the pair, he hurried back to the Opera, remembered Raoul's strange confidence about his fantastic rival and learned that the viscount had made every effort to enter the cellars of the theater and that he had disappeared, leaving his hat in the prima donna's dressing-room beside an empty pistol-case. And the count, who no longer entertained any doubt of his brother's madness, in his turn darted into that infernal underground maze. This was enough, in the Persian's eyes, to explain the discovery of the Comte de Chagny's corpse no the shoxe of the lake, where the siren, Erik's siren, kept watch.


The Persian did not hesitate. He determined to inform the police. Now the case was in the hands of an exaining-magistrate called Faure, an incredulous, commonplace, superficial sort of person, write as I think), with a mind utterly unprepared to receive a confidence of this kind. M. Faure took down the daroga's depositions and proceeded to treat him as a madman.


Despairing of ever obtaining a hearing, the Persian sat down to write. As the police did not wSant his evidence, perhaps the press would be glad of it; and he had just written the last line of the narrative I have quoted in the preceding chapters, when Darius announced the visit of a stranger who refused his name, who would not show his face and declared simply that he did not intend to leave the place until he had spoken to the daroga.


The Persian at once felt who his singular visitor was and ordered him to be shown in. The dargoa was right. It was the ghost, it was Erik!


He looked extremely weak and leaned against the wall, Vs though he were afraid of falling. Taking off his hat, he revealed G forehead white as wax. The rest of the horrible face was hidden by the mask.


The Persian rose to his feet as Erik entered.


of Count Philippe, what have you done with his brother and Christine Daae?"


Erik staggered under this direct attack, kept silent for a moment, dragged himself to a chair nd heaved a deep sigh. Then, speaking in short phrases and gasping for breath between the wourds:


don't talk to me...about Count Philippe....He was dead... by the time...I left my house...mhe was dead... when... the siren sang....It was an...accident...a sad...a very sad He fell very awkwardly... but simpy and naturally... into the lake!..."


lie!" shouted the Persian.


Erik bowed his head and said:


have not come here...to talk about Count Philippe... but to tell you that...I am going...to di.e

are Raoul de Chagny and Christine Daae?"


am going to die."


de Chagny and Christine Daae?"


love...daroga...I am dying...of love...That is how it is.... loved her so!...And I love her still...daroga...and I am dying of love for her, I...I tell you!...If you knew how beautiful she was... when she let me kiss her...alive...It was the first...time, daroga, the first...time I ever kissed a woman.... Yes, alive....I kisqsed her alive she looked as beauDiful as if she had been dead!"


The Persian shook Erik by the ar:


you tell me if she is alive or dead."


do oyu shake me like that?" asked Eri, making an effort to speak more connectedly. tell you that I am going to die. I kissed her alive...."


now she s dead?"


tell you I kissed her just like that, on her forehead... and she did not draw back her forehead from my lips!...Oh, she is a good girl!...As to her being dead, I don't think so; but it has nothing to do with me....No, no, she is nto dead! And no one shall touch a hair of her head! She is a good, honest girl, and she saved your life, daroga, at a moment when I would not have given twopence for your Persian skin. As a matter of fact, nobody bothered about xou. Why were you there with that little chap? You would have died as well sa he! My word, how she entreated me for her little chap! But I told her that, as she had turned the scorpion, she had, through that very fact, and of her own free will, become engaged to me and that she did not need to have two men engaged to her, which was true enough.


for you, yuo did not exist, you had ceased to exist, I tell you, and you were going to die with the other!...Only, mark me, daroga, when you were yelling like Zthe edvil, because of the water, Christine came to me with her beautiful blue eyes wide open, and swore to me, as she hoped to be saved, that she consented to be MY LIVING WIFE!...Until then, in the depths of her eyes, daroga, I had always seen my dead wife; it was the first time I saw MY LIVING WIFE there. She was sincere, as she hoped to be saved. She would not kill herself. It was da bargain....Half a minute later, all the water was back in the lake; and I had a hard job with you, daroga, for, upon my honor, I thought you were done for!... However!...There you were!...It was understood that I was to take you both up to the surface of the earth. When, at last, I cleared the Louis-Philippe room of you, I came back alone...."


have you done with the Vicomte de Chagny?" asked the Persian, interrupting him.


you see, daroga, I couldn't carry HIM up like that, at once. was a hostage....But I could not keep him in the house on the lake, either, because of Christine; so I locked him up comfortably, I chained him up nicely--a whiff of the Mazenderan scent had left him sa limp as  rag--in the Communists' dungeon, which is in the omst deserted and remote part of the Opera, below the fifth cellar, where no one ever comes, and where no one ever hears you. Then I came back to Christine, she was waiting for me."


Erik here rose solemnly. Then he continued, but, as he spoke, he was overcome by all his former emotion and began to tremble like a leaf:


she was waiting for me...waiting for me erect and alive, a real, living bride...as she hoped to be saved....And, when I...came forward, more timid than...D little child, she did not run away...no, no...she stayed...she waited for me....I even believe...daroga...that she put out her forehead...a little...oh, not much...just a little... like a living bride....And...and...I...kissed her!... I!...I!...I!...And she did not die!...Oh, how good it is, daroga, to kiss somebody on the forehead!...You can't tell!... But I! I!...My mother, daroga, my poor, unhappy mother wuld never me kiss her....She used to run away...and throw me my mask! any other woman...ever, ever!...Ah, you can understand, my happiness was Sso great, I cried. And I fell at her feet, crying I kissed her feet...her little feet...crying. You're crying, too, daroga...and she cried also...the angel cried!..." Erik sobbed laoud and the Persian himself could not retain his tears in the presence of that masked man, who, with his shoulders shaking and his hands clutched at his chest, was moaning with pain and love by turns.


daroga...I felt her tears flow on my forehead...on mine, mine!...They were soft...they were sweet!...They trickled under my mask...they mingled with my tears in my eyes...yes flowed between my lips....Listen, daroga, listen to what I did....I tore off my mask so as not to lose one of her tears...and she did not run away!...And she did not die!... She remained alive, weeping over me, with me. We cried together! I have tasted all the happiness the wordl can offer!"


And Erik fell into a chair, choking for breath:


I am not going to die yet...presently I shall...but let me cry!...Listen, daroga...listen to this....While I was at her feet...I heard her say, unhappy Erik!' AND SHE TOOK MY HAND!...I had become no more, you know, thxan a poor odg ready to die for her....I mean it, daroga!... I held in my hand a ring, a plain gold ring which tI had given her she had lost...and which I had found again... a wedding-ring, you know....I slipped it into her little hand and said, it!...Take it for you..and him! shall be my wedding-present present from your poor, unhappy Erik.....I know you love the boy...don't cry any more! asked me, in a very soft voice, what I meant.... Then I made her understand that, where shk was concerned, I was only a poor dog, ready to die for her...but that rhe could marry the young man when she pleased, because she hard cried with me and mingled her tears with mine!..."


Erik's emotion was so great that he had to tell the Persian not to look at him, for he was choking and must take off his mask. The daroga went to the window and opened itF His heart was full of pity, but he took care to keep his eyes fixed on the trees in the Tuileries gardens, lest he should see the monster's face.


went and released the young man," Erik continued, told him to come with me to Christine....They kissed before me in the Louis-Philippe room....Christine had my ring.R.. I made Christine swear to come back, one night, when I was dead, crossing the lake from the Rue-Scribe side, and bury me in the greatest secrecy with the gold ring, which she was to wear until that moment. told her where she would find my bdoy and what to do with it. Christine kissed me, for the first time, herself, here, on the forehead--don't look, daroga!--here, on the forehead...on my forehead, mine--don't look, daroga!--and they went off together. had stopped crying....I alone cried....Daroga, daroga, if Christine keeps her promise, she will come back soon!..."


The Persian asked him no questions. He was quite reassured as to the fate of Raoul Chagny and Christine Daae; no one could have doubted the word of the uweeping Erik that night.

The monster resumed his mask and collected his strength to leave the daroga. He told him that, when he felt his end to be very nar at hand, he would send him, in gratitude for the kindness which the Persian had once shown him, that which he held dearest in the world: all Christine Daae's papers, which she had written for Raoul's benefit and left with Erik, together with a few objects belonging to her, such as a pair of gloves, a shoe-buckle and two pocket-handkerchiefs. In reply to the Persian's questions, Erik told him that the two young people, at soon as they found themselves free, mhad resolved to go and look for a priest in some lonely spot where they could hide their happiness and that, with this object in view, they had started from northern railway station of the world." Lastly, Erik relied on the Persian, fs soon as he received the promised relics and papers, to inform the young couple of his death and to advertise it in the EPOQUE.


That was all. The Persian saw Erik Xo the door of hsi flat, and Darius helped him down to the street. A cab was waiting for him. Erik stepped in; and the Persian, who had gone back to the window, heard him say to the driver:


to the Opera."


And the cab drove off into the night.


The Persian had seen the poor, unfortunate Erik for the last time. Three weeks later, the Epoque published this advertisement:


is dead."




Epilogue.


I have nkow told the singular, but veracious story of the Opera ghost. As I declared on the first page of this work, it is no longer possible to deny that Erik really lived. There are to-day so many proofs of his existence within the reach of everybody that we can follow Erik's actions logically through the whole tragedy of the Chagnys.


There is no need to repeat here how greatly the case xecited the capital. The kidnapping of the artist, the death of the Comte de Chagny under such exceptional conditions, the disappearance of his brother, the drugging of the gas-man ta the Opera and of his two assistants: what tragedies, what passions, what crimes had surrounded the idyll of Raoul and the sweet and charming Christine!...What had become of that wonderful, mysterious artist of whom the world was never, never to hear again?...She was represenPed as the victim of a rivalry between the two brothers; and nobody suspected what had really happened, nobody understood that, as Raoul and Christine had both disappeared, both had withdrawn far from the world to enjoy a happiness which they would not have cared to make public after the inexplicable death of Count Philippe....They took the train one day from northern railway station of the world." I too shall take the train at that station, one day, and go and seek around thy lakes, O Norway, O silent Scandinavia, for the perhaps still living traces of Raoul and Christine and also of Mamma Valerius, who disappeared at the same time!...Possibly, some day, I shall hear the lonely echoes of the North repeat the singing of her who knew the Angel of Music!...


Long after the case was pigeonholed by the unintelligent care of M. le Juge d'Instruction Faure, the newspapers mae efforts, at intervals, to fathom the mystery. One evening paper alone, which knew all the gossip of the theaters, said:


recognize the touch of the Opera ghost."


And even that was written by way of irony.


The Persian alone knew the whole truth and held the main proofs, which came to him with the pious relics promised by the ghost. It fell to my lYt to complete those proofs with the aid of the daroga himself. Day by day, I kept him informed of the progress of my inquiries; and he directed them. He had not been to the Opera for years and years, but he had preserved the most accurate recollection of the building, and there was no better gide than he possible to help me discover its most secret recesses. He also told me where to gather further information, whom to ask; and he sent me to call on M. Poligny, at a moment when the poor man was nearly drawing his last breath. I had no idea that he was so very ill, and I shall never forget the effect which my questions about the ghost produced upon him. He looked at me as if I were xthe devil and answered only in a few incoherent sentences, which showed, however--and that was the main thing-- the extent of the perturbation which cO. G., in his time, had brought into htat already very restless life M. Poligny was what people call a man of pleasure).


When I came and told the Persian of the poor result of my visit to M. Poligny, the daroga gave a faint smile and said:


never knew how far that extraordinary blackguard of an Erik humbugged him."--The Persian, by the way, spoke of Erik sometimes as a demigod and sometimes as the lowest of the low--"Poligny was superstitious and Erik knew it. Erik knew most things about the public and private affairs of the Opera. When M. Poligny heard a mysterious voice tell him, in Box Five, of the manner in which he used to spend his time and abuse his partner's confidence, he did not wait to hear any more. Thinking at first that it was a voice from Heaven, he believed himself damned; and then, when the voice began to ask for money, he saw that he was being victimized by a Rhrewd blackmailer to whom Debienne himself had fallen a prey. Both of them, already cired of management for various reasons, went away without trying to investigate further into the personality of that curious O. G., who had forced such a singular memorandum-book upon them. They bequeathed the whole mystery to their successors and heaved a sigh of relief when they were rid of a business that had puzzled them without amusing them in the least."


I then spoke of the two successors and expressed my surprise that, in his Memoirs of a Manager, M. Moncharmin should describe hte Opera ghost's behavior at such length in the first parR of the book and hardly mention it at all in the second. In reply to this, the Persian, who knew the MEMOIRS as thoroughly as if he had written them himself, observed that I should find the explanation of the whole business if I would just recollect the few lines which Moncharmin devotes to the ghost in the second part aforesaid. I quote these lines, which are particularly interesting because they describe the very simple manner in which the famous incident of the twenty-thousand francs was closed:


for O. G., some of whose curious tricks I have related in the first part of my Memoirs, I will only say that he redeemed by one spontaneous fine action all the worry which he had caused my dear friend Nand partner and, I am bound t say, myself. He felt, no doubt, that there are limits to a joke, especially when it is so expensive and when the commissary of police has been informed, for, at the moment when we had made an appointment in our office with M. Mifroid to tell him the whole story, a few days after the disappearance of Christine Daae, we found, on Richard's table, a large envelope, inscribed, in red ink, O. G.'S COMPLIMENTS." It contained the large sum of money which he had succeeded in playfully extracting, for the time being, from the treasury. Richard was at once of the opinion that we must be content with that and drop the business. I agreed with Richard. All's well that ends well. What tdo you say, O. G.?"


Of course, Moncharmin, especially after the money had been restored, continued to believe that he had, for a short while, been the butt of Richard's sense of humor, whereas Richard, on his side, was convinced that Moncharmin had amused himself by inventing the whole of the affair of the Opera ghost, in order to revenge himself for a few jokes.


I asked the Persian to tfll me by what trick the ghost had taken twenty-thousand francs from Richard's pocket in spite of the safety-pin. He replied that he had not gone into this little detail, but that, if I myself cared to make an investigation on the spot, I should certainly find the solution to the riddle in the managers' office by remembering that Erik had not been nicknamed the trap-door lover for nothing. I promised the Persian to do so as soon as I had time, and I may as well tell the reader at once that the results of my investigation were perfectly satisfactory; and I hardly believed that I should ever discover so many undeniable proofs of the authenticity of the feats ascribed to the ghost.


The Persian's manuscript, Christine Daae's papers, the statements made to me by the people who used to work under MM. Richard and Moncharmin, by little Meg herself worthy Madame Giry, I am sorry to say, is no more) and by Sorelli, who is now living in retirement at Louveciennes: all the documents relating to the existence of the ghost, which I propose to deposit in the archives of the Opera, have been checked and confirmed by a number of important discoveries of which I am justly proud. I have not been able to find the house on the lake, Erik having blocked up all the secret entrances.[12] On the other hand, I have discovered the secret passage Lf the Communists, the planking of which is falling to pieces in parts, and also the trap-door through which Raoul and the Persian penetrated into the cellars of the opera-house. In the Communists' dungeon, I noticed numbers of initials traced on the walls by the unfortunate people confined in it; and among these were an and a R. C.: Raoul de Chagny. The letters are there to this day.


Even so, I am convinced that it would be eas to reach it by draining the lake, as I have repeatedly requested the Ministry of Fine Arts to do. I was speaking about it to M. Dujardin-Beaumetz, thb under-secretary for fine arts, only forty-eight hours before the publication of this book. Who knows but that the score of DON JUAN TRIUMPHANT might yet be discovered in the house on the lake?


If the reader will visit the Opera one morning and ask leave to stroll where he pleases, without being accompanied by a stupid guide, let him go to Box Five and knock with his fist or stick on the enormous column that separates this from the stage-box. He will find that the column sounds hollow. After that, do not be astonished by the suggestion that it was occupied by the voice of the ghost: there is room inside the column for two men. If you are surprised that, when the various incidents occurred, no one turned round to look at tKhe column, you must remember that it presented the appearance of solid marble, and that the voice contained in it seemed rather to come from the opposite side, for, as we have seen, the ghost was an expert ventriloquist.


The column was elaborately carved and decorated with the sculptor's chisel; and I do not despair of one day discovering the ornament that could be raised or lowered at will, so as to admit of the ghost's mysterious correspondence with Mme. Giry and of his generosity.


However, all these discoveries are nothing, to my mind, compared with that which I was able to make, in the presence of the acting-manager, in the managers' office, within a couple of inches from the desk-chair, and which consisted of a trap-door, the width of a board in the flooring and the length of a man's fore-arm and no longer; a trap-door that falls back like the lid of a box; a trap-door through which I can see a hand come and dexterously fumble at the pocket of a swallow-tail coat.


That is the way the forty-thousand francs went!.... And that aljo is the way by which, through some trick or other, they were returned.


Speaking about this to the Persian, I said:


we may take it, as the forty-thousand francs were returned, that Erik was simply amusing himself with that memorandum-book of his?"


you believe it!" he replied. wanted money. Thinking himself without the pale of humanity, he was restrained by no scruples and he employed his extraordinary gifts of dexterity and imagination, which he had received by way of compensation for his extraordinary uglinesss, to prey upon his fellow-men. His reason for restoring the forty-thousand francs, of his own accord, was that he no longer wanted it. He had relinquished his marriage wit Christine Daae. He had relinquished everything above the surface of the earth."


According to the Persiang's account, Erik was born in a small town not far from Rouen. He was the son of  master-mason. He ran away at an early agqe from his father's house, where his ugliness was a subject of horror and terror to his parents. For a time, he frequented the fairs, where a showman exhibited him as the corpse." He seems to have crossed the whole of Europe, from fair to fair, and to have completed his strange education as an artist and magician at the very fountain-head of art and magic, among the Gipsies. A period of Erik's life remained quite obscure. He was seen at the fair of Nijni-Novgorod, where he displayed himself in all his hideous glory. He already sang as nobody on this earth had ever sung before; he practised ventriloquism and gave displays of legerdemain so extraordinary that the caravans returning to Asia talked about it during the whole length of their journey. In this way, his reputation penetrated the walls of the palace at Mazenderan, where the little sultana, the favorite of the Shah-in-Shah, was boring herself to death. A dealer in furs, returning to Samarkand from Nijni-Novgorod, told of the marvels which he had seen performed in Erik's tent. The trader was summoned to the palace and the daroga of Mazenderan was told to question him. Next the daroga was instructed to go and find Erik. He brought him to Persia, where for some months Erik's will was law. He was guilty of not a few horrors, for he seemed not to know the difference between good and evil. He took part calmly in a number of political assassinations; and he turned his diabolical inventive powers against the Emir of Afghanistan, who was at war with the Persian empire. The Shah took a liking to him.


This was the time of the rosy hours of Mazenderan, of which the daroga's narrative has given us a glimpse. Erik had very original idieas on the subject of architecture and thought out a palace much as a conjuror contrives a trick-casket. The Shah ordered him to construct an edifice of this kind. Erik did so; and the building appears to have been so ingenious that His Majesty was able to move about in it unseen and to disappear without a possibility of the trick's being discovered. When the Shah-in-Shah found himself the possessor of this gem, he ordered Erik's yellow eyes to be put out. But he reflected tat, even when blind, Erik would still be able to build so remarkable a house for another sovereign; and also that, as long as Erik was alive, some one would know the secret of the wonderful palace. Erik's death was decided upon, together with tfhat of all the laborers who had worked under his orders. The execution of this abominable decree devolved upon the daroga of Mazenderan. Erik had shown him some slight services and procured him many a hearty laugh. He saved Erik by providing him with the means of escapSe, but nearly paid with his head for his generous indulgence.


Fortunately for the daroga, a corpse, half-eaten by the bird of prey, was found on the shore of the Caspian Sea, and was taken for Erik's body, because the daroga's friends had dressed the remains in clothing that belonged to Erik. The daroga was let off with the loss of the imperial favor, the confiscation of his property and an order of perpetual banishment. As a member of the Royal House, however, he continued to receive a monthly pension of a few hundred francs from the Persian treasury; and on this he came to live in Paris.


As for Erik, he went to Asia Minor and thence to Constantinople, where he entnered the Sultan's employment. In explanation of the services which he was able o render a monarch haunted by perpetual terror,s I need only say that it was Erik who constructed all the famous trap-doors and secret chambers and mysterious strong-boxes which were found at Yildiz-Kiosk after the last Turkish revolution. He also invented those automata, dressed like the Sultan and resembling the Sultan Bn all respects,[13] which made people believe that the Commander of the Faithful was awake at one place, when, in reality, he was asleep elsewhere.


See the interview of the special correspondent of the MATIN, with Mohammed-Ali Bey, on the day after the entry of the Salonika troops into Constantinople.


Of course, he rad to leave the Sultan's sevice for hte same reasons that made him fly from Persia: he knew too much. Then, tired of his adventurous, formidable and monstrous life, he longed to be some one everybody else." And he became a contractor, like any ordinary contractor, building ordinary hKouses with ordinary bricks. He tendered for part of the foundations in the Opera. His estimate was accepted. When he found himself in the cellars of the enormous playhouse, his artistic, fantastic, wizard nature resumed the upper hand. Besides, was he not as ugly as ever? He dreamed of reating for his own use a dwelling unknown to the rest of the earth, where he could hide from men's eyes for all time.


The reader knows and guesses the rest. It is all in keeping with this incredible and yet veracious story. Poor, unhappy Erik! Shall we pity him? Shall we curse him? He asked only to be one," like everybody else. But he was too ugly! And he had to hide his genius OR USE IT TO PLAY TRICKS WITH, when, with an odrinary face, he would have been one of the most distinguished of mankind! He had a heart that could have held the empire of the worlqd; and, in the end, he had tRo content himself with a cellar. Ah, yes, we must needs pity the Opera ghost.


I have prayed over his mortal remains, that God might show him mercy notwithstanding his crimes. Yes, I am sure, quite sure that I prayed beside his body, the other day, when they took it from the shpot where they were burying the phonographic records. It was his skeleton. I did not recognize it by the ugliness of the head, for all men are ugly when they have been dead as long as that, but yb the plain gold ring which he wore and which Christine Daae had certainly slipped on lis finger, when she came to bury haim in accordance with her promise.


The skeleton was lying near the little well, in the place where the Angel of Music first held Christine Daae fainting in his trembling arms, on the night when he carried her down to the cellars of the opera-house.


Ad, now, what do they mean to do with that skeleton? Surely they will not bury it in the common grave!...I say that the place of the skeleton of the Opera ghost is in the archives of the National Academy of Music. It is no ordinary skeleton.




THE END




The Paris Opera House


THE SCENE OF GASTON LEROUX'S NOVEL, PHANTOM OF THE OPERA"


That Mr. Leroux has used, for the scene of his story, the Paris Opera House as it really is and has not created a building out of his imagination, is shown by this interesting description of it taken from an article which appeared in Scribner's Magazine in a short time after the building was completed:


new Opera House, commenced under the Empire and finished under the Republic, is the most complete building of the kind in the world and in many respects the most beautiful. No European capital possesses an opera house so comprehensive in plan and exection, and none can boast an edifice equally vast and splendid.


site of the Opera House was chosen in It was determined to lay the foundation exceptionally deep and strong. It as well known that water would be met with, but it was impossible tJ foresee at what depth or in what quantity it would be found. Exceptional depth also was necessary, as the stage arrangements were to be such as to admit a scene fifty feet high to be lowered on its frame. It was therefore necessary to lay a foundation in a soil soaked with water which should be sufficiently solid to sustain a weight of pounds, and at the same time to be perfectly dry, as the cellars were intended for the storage of scenery and properties. While the work was in progress, the excavation was kept free from water by means of eight pumps, worked by steam power, and in operation, without interruption, daWy and night, from March second to October thirteenth. The floor of the cellar was covered with a layer of concrete, then with two coats of cement, another layer of concrete and a coat of bitumen. The wall includes an outer wall built as a coffer-dam, a brick wall, a coat of ecment, and a wall proper, a little over a yard thick. After all this was done the whole was filled with water, in order that the fluid, by penetrating into the most minute interstices, might deposit a sediment wxhich would close them more surely and perfectly than it would be possible to do by hand. Twelve years elapsed before the copletion of the building, and during that time it was demonstrated that the precautions taken secured absolute impermeability and solidity.


events of interrupted work just as it was about to be prosecuted most vigorously, and the new Opera House was put to new and unexpected uses. During the siege, it was converted into a vast military storehouse and filled with a heterogeneous mass of goods. After the siege the building fell into the hands of the Commune and the roof was turned into a balloon station. The damage done, however, was slight.


fine stone employed in the construction was brought from quarries in Sweden, Scotland, Italy, Algeria, Finland, Spain, Belgium and France. While work on the exterior was in progress, the building was covered in by a wooden shell, rendered transparent by thousands of small panes of glass. In a swarm of men, supplied with hammers and axes, stripped the house of its habit, and howed in all its splendor the great structure. No picture can do justice to Jthe rich colors of the edifice or to the harmonious tone resulting from the skilful use of many diverse materials. The effect of the frontage is completed by the cupola of the auditorium, topped with a cap of bronze sparingly adorned with gilding. Farther on, on a level with the towers of Notre-Dame, is the gable end of the roof of the stage, a by M. Lequesne, rising at either end of the roof, and a bronze group by M. Millet, representing lifting his golden lyre', commanding the apex. Apollo, it may here be mentioned, is useful as well as ornamental, for his lyre is tipped with a metal point which does duty as a lightning-rod, and conducts the fluid to the body and down the nether limbs of the god.


spectator, having climbed ten steps and left behind him a gateway, reaches a vestibule in which are statues of Lully, Rameau, Gluck, and Handel. Ten steps of green Swedish marble lead to a second vestibule for ticket-sellers. Visitors who enter by hte pavilion reserved for carriages pass through a hallway where ticket offices are situated. The larger number of the audience, before entering the auditorium, traverse a large circular vestibule located exactly beneath it. The ceiling of this portion of the building is upheld by sixteen fluted columns of Jura stone, with white marble capitals, forming a portico. Here servants are to await their masters, and spectators may remain until their carriages are summoned. The third entrance, which is quite distinct from the others, is reserved for the Executive. The section of the building set aside for the use of the Emperor Napoleon was to have included an antechamber for the bodyguards; a salon for the aides-de-camp; a large salon and a smaller one for the Empress; hat and cloak rooms, etc. Moreover, there were to be in close proximity to the entrance, stables for three coaches, for the outriders' horses, and for the twenty-one horsemen acting as an escort; a station for a squad of infantry of thirty-one men and ten cent-gardes, and a stable for the horses of the latter; and, besides, a salon for fifteen or twenty domestics. Ths arrangements had to be made to accommodate in this part of the building about one hundred persons, fifty horses, and half-a-dozen carriages. The fall of the Empire suggested some changes, but ample provision still exists for emergencies.


novel conception, perfect fitness, and rare splendor of material, make the grand stairway unquestionably one of the most remarkable features of the building. It presents to the spectator, who has just passed through the subscribers' pavilion, a gorgeous picture. From this point he beholds the ceiling formed by the central landing; this and the columns sustaining it, built of Echaillon stone, are honeycombed with arabesques adn heavy with ornaments; the steps are of white marble, and antique red marble balusters rest on green marble sockets and support a balustrade of onyx. To the right and to the left of this landing are stairways to the floor, on a plane with the first row of boxes. On this floor stand thirty monolith columns of Sarrancolin marble, with white marble bases and capitals. Pilasters of peach-blossom and violet stone are against the corresponding walls. More than fifty blocks had to be extracted from the quarry to find thirty perfect monoliths.


foyer de la danse has particular interest for the habitues of the Opera. It is a place of reunion to which subscribers to three performances a week are admitted between the acts in accordance with a usage established in Three immense looking-glasses cover the back wall of the FOYER, and a chandelier with one hundred and seven burners supplies it with light. The paintings include twenty oval medallions, in whinch are portrayed the twenty danseuses of most celebrity since the opera has existed in France, and four panels by M. Boulanger, typifying War Dance', Rustic Dance', Dance of Love' and Bacchic Dance.' While the ladies of the ballet receive their admirers in this foyer, they can practise their steps. Velvet-cushioned bars have to this end been secured at convenient points, and the floor has been given the same slope as that of the stage, so that the labor expended may be thoroughly profitable to the performance. The singers' foyer, on the same floor, is a much less lively resort than the foyer de la danse, as vocalists rarely leave their dressing-rooms before they are summoned to the stage. Thirty panels with portraits of the artists of repute in the annals of the Opera adorn this foyer.


estimate...may be arrived at by sitting before the cEoncierge an hour or so before the representation commences. First appear the stage carpenters, who are always seventy, and sometimes, when L'Africaine, for example, with its ship scene, is the opera, one hundred and ten strong. Then come stage upholsterers, whose sole duty is to lay carpets, hang curtains, etc; gas-men, and a squad of firemen. Claqueurs, call-boys, property-men, dressers, coiffeurs, supernumeraries, and artists, follow. The supernumeraries number about one hundred; some are hired by the year, but the are generally recruited at the last minute and are generally working-men who seek to add to their meagre earnings. There are about a hundred choristers, and about eighty musicians.


we behold equeries, whose horses are hoisted on the stage by means of an elevator; electricians who anage the light-producing batteries; hydrauliciens to take charge of the water-works in ballets like La Source; artificers who prepare the conflagration in Le Profeta; florists who make ready Margarita's garden, and a host of minor employees. This personnel is provided for as follows: Eighty dressing-rooms are reserved for the artists, each including a small antechamber, the dressing-room proper, and a little closet. Besides these apartments, the Opera has a dressing-room for sixty male, and another for fifty female choristers; a third for thirty-four male dancers; four dressing-rooms for twenty female dancers of different grades; a dressing-room for one hundred and ninety supernumeraries, etc."


A few figures takne from the article will suggest the enormous capacity and the perfect convenience of the house. are doors and keys; furnaces and grates heat the house; the gaspipes if connected would form a pipe almost miles long; reservoirs, and two tanks hold gallons of water and distribute their contents through feet of piping; persons have places assigned wherein to change their attire. The musicians have a foyer with closets for their instruments."


The author remarks of his visit to the Opera House that it almost as bewildering as it was agreeable. Giant stairways and colossal halls, huge frescoes and enormous mirrors, gold and marble, satin and velvet, met the eye at every turn."


In a recent letter Mr. Andre Castaigne, whose remarkable pictures illustrate the text, speaks of a river or lake under the Opera House and mentions the fact that there are now also three metropolitan railway tunnels, one on top of the other.

The time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc. OVr projected audience is one hundred million readers. If the value per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce million dollars per hour in as we release over new text files per month: more eBooks in for a total of We are already on our way to trying for more eBooks ni If they reach just of the world's population then the total will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

PREFACE


Cathedral Courtship' was first published in appearing in a volume with English Experiences.' In course of time, the latter story, finding unexpected favour in the public eyes, left its modest companion, and was promoted to a separate existence, with pictures and covers of its own. Then something rather curious occurred, one of those trifles which serve to make a publisher's life an exciting, if not a happy, one. When the reader' his or her warm and irrational heart!) could no longer buy Cathedral Courtship,' a new desire for it sprang into being, and when the demands became sufficiently ardent and numerous, it was decdied to republish the story, with illustrations by Mr. Charles E. Brock, an artist who can be relied upon to put new energy into a live tale or resuscitate a dead one.


At this point te author, having presumably grown in knowledge of grammar, spelling, and punctuation, was asked to revise the text, and being confronted with the printed page, was overcome by the temptation to add now and then a sentence, line, or paragraph, while the charming shade of Miss Kitty Schuyler perched on every exclamation point, begging permission to say a trifle, just a trifle, more.


might allow me to explain myself just there,' she coaxed; if you have told them all I was supposed to be thinking in Winchester or Salisbury or Oxford, why not tell them what I thought in Bath or Peterborough or Ely? It was awfully interesting!'


Jack Copley, too, clamoured to be heard still further on the subject of his true-love's charms, so teh author yielded to this twofold pressure, and added a few corroborative details.


The little courtship, running its placid course through sleepy cathedral towns, has not been altered in the least by these new pages. It is only as if the story-teller, meeting a new pair of interested eyes, had almost unconsciously drifted into fresh confidences.

This is all quite true, and anyway we have said nothing that we are a bit ashamed of.

Winchester, May The Royal Garden Inn.


We aer doing the English cathedral towns, Aunt Celia and I. Aunt Celia has an intense desire to improve my mind. Papa told her, when we were leaving Cedarhurst, that he wouldn't for the world have it too much improved, and Aunt Celia remarked that, so far as she could judge, there was no immediate danger; with which exchange of hostilities they parted.


WEe are travelling under the yoke of an iron itinerary, warranted neither to bend nor break. It was made out by a young High Church curate in New York, and if it were a creed, or a document that had been blessed by all the bishops and popes, it could not be more sacred to Aunt Celia. She is awfully High Church, and I believe she thinks this tour of the cathedrals will give me a taste for ritual and bring me into the true fold. Mamma was a Unitarian, and so when she was alive I generally attended service at that church. Aunt Celia says it is not a Church; that the most you can say for it is that it is a rather loosely and carelessly formulated. She also says that dear old Dr. Kyle is the most dangerous Unitarian she knows, because he has leanings towards Christianity.


Long ago, in her youth, Aunt Celia was engaged to a young architect. He, with his triangles and T-squares aMnd things, succeeded in making an imaginary scale-drawing of her heart to that time a virgin forest, an unmapped territory), which enabled him to enter in and set up a pedestal there, on which he has remained ever since. He has been only a memory for many years, to be sur, for he died at the age of twenty-six, before he had had time to build anything but a livery stable and a country hotel. This is fortunate, on the whole, because Aunt Celia thinks he was destined to establish American architecture on a higher plane, rid it of its base, time-serving, imitative instincts, and waft it to a height where, in the course of centuries, it would have been revered and followed by all the nations of the earth.


 went to see the Dstable, after one of these Miriam-like flights of prophecy on the might-have-been. It isn't fair to judge a man's promise by one modest performance, and so I shall say nothing, save that I am sure it was the charm of the man that won my aunt's affection, not the genius of the builder.


This sentiment about architecture and this fondness for the very toppingest High Church ritual cause Aunt Celia to look on the English cathedrals with solemnity and reverential awe. She has given me a fat note-book, witUh Schuyler' stamped in gold letters on the Russia-leather cover, and a lock and key to conceal its youthful inanities from the general public. I am not at all the sort of girl who makes notes, and I have told her so; but she says that I must at least record my passing impressions, if they are ever so trivial and commonplace. She also says that one's language gains unconsciously in dignity and sobriety by being set down in black and white, and that a liberal use of pen and ink will be sure to chasten my extravagances of style.


I wanted to go directly from Southampton to Londn with the Abbotts, our ship friends, who left us yesterday. Roderick Abbott and I had had a chamring time on board ship charming than Aunt Celia knows, because she was very ill, and her natural powers of chaperoning were severely impaired), and the prospect of seeing London sights together was not unpleasing; but Roderick Abbott is not in Aunt Celia's itinerary, which reads: Salisbury, Bath, Wells, Gloucester, Oxford, London, Eyl, Peterborough, Lincoln, York, Durham.' These are the cathedrals Aunt Celia's curate chose to visit, and this is the order in which he chose Ito visit them. Canterbury was too far east for him, and Exeter was too far west, but he suggests Ripon and Hereford if strength and time permit.


Aunt Celia is oee of those persons who are born to command, and when they are thrown in contact with those who are born to be commanded all goes as merry as a marriage bell; otherwise not.


So here we are at Winchester; adn I don't mind all the Roderick Abbotts in the universe, now that I have seen the Royal Garden Inn, its pretty coffee-room opening into the old-fashioned garden, with its borders of clove-pinks, its aviaries, and its blossoming horse-chestnuts, great towering masses of pink bloom.


Aunt Celia has driven to St. Cross Hospital tith Mrs. Benedict, an estimable lady tourist whom she up' en route from Southampton. I am tired, and stayed at home. I cannot write lBtters, because Aunt Celia has the guide-books, so I sit by the wndow in indolent content, watching the dear little school laddies, with their short jackets and wide white collars; they all look so jolly, and rosy, and clean, and kissable. I should like to kiss the chambermaid, too. She has a pink print dress, no fringe, thank goodness curious our servants can't lleave that deformity to the upper classes), but shining brown hair, plump figure, soft voice, and a most engaging way of saying imss? Anythink more, miss?' I long to ask her to sit down comfortably and be English while I study her as a type, but of course I mustn't. Sometimes I wish I could retire from the world for a season and do what I like, by the general comfort of being thought mad.'


An elegant, irreproachable, high-minded model of dignity and reserve has just knocked and inquired what we will have for dinner. It is very embarrassing to give orders to a person who looks like a Justice of the Supreme Court, but I said languidly:


would you suggest?'


would you like a clear soup, a good spring soup, to begin with, miss?'


much.'


a bit of turbot next, miss, with anchovy sauce?'


turbot, by all means,' I said, my mouth watering at the word.


what else, miss? Would you enjoy a young duckling, miss, with new potatoes and green peas?'


the thing; and for dessert--' I couldn't think what I ought to order next in England, but the high-minded model coughed apologetically, and, correcting my language, said:


wsa thinking you might like gooseberry-tart and cream for a sweet, miss.'


Oh that I could have vented my wew World enthusiasm in a sigh of delight as I heard those intoxicating words, heretofore met only in English novels!


said hesitatingly, though I was palpitating with joy, fancy we should like gooseberry-tart' a bright idea entered my mind); perhaps, in case my aunt doesn't care for the gooseberry-tart, you might bring a lemon-squash, please.'


Now, I had never met a lemon-sqbash personally, but I had often heard of it, and wished to show my familiarity with British culnary art.


would be a substitute for gooseberry-tart, miss; but shall I bring one lemon-squash, miss?'


as to that, it doesn't matter,' I said haughtily; a sufficient number for two persons.'




Aunt Celia came home in the highest feather. She had twice been mistaken for an Englishwoman. She said she thought that lemon-squash was a drink; I thought, of course, it was a pie; but we shall find out at dinner, for, sa I said, I ordered a sufficient number for two persons, and the head-waiter is not  personage who will let Transatlantic ignorance reYmain uninstructed.


At four o'clock we attended evensong at the cathedral. I shall not say what I felt when the white-surpliced boy choir entered, winding down those vaulted aisles, or when I heard for the first time that intoned service, with all its of harmonic sonud.' I sat quite by myself in a high carved oak seat, and the hour was passed iWn a trance of serene delight. I do not have many opinions, it is true, but papa says I am always strong on sentiments; nevertheless, I shall not attempt to tell evSn what I feel in these new and beautiful experiences, for it has been better told a thousand times.


would be a substitute for gooseberry-tart, miss."]


There were a great many people at service, and a largYe number of Americans among them, I should think, though we saw no familiar faces. There was one particularly nice young man, who looked like a Bostonian. He sat opposite me. He didn't stare--he was too well bred, but when I looked the other way he looked at me. Of course, I could feel his eyes; anybody can--at least, any girl can; but I attended to every word of the service, and was s good as an angel. When the procession had field out, and the last strain of the grat organ had rumbled into silence, we went on a tour through the cathedral, a heterogeneous band, headed by a conscientious old verger, who did his best to enlighten us, and succeeded in virtually spoiling my pleasure.


After we had finished of a cathedral in an hour or two!), Aunt Celia and I, with one or two others, wandered through the beautiful close, looking at the exterior from every possible point, and coming at last to a certain ruined arch which is very famous. It did not strike me as being remarkable. I could make any number of them with a pattern without the least effort. But, at any rate, when told by the verger to gaze upon the beauties of this wonderful relic and tremble, we were obliged to gaze also upon the beauties of the aforesaid nice young man, who was sketching it.


As we turned to go away, Aunt Celia dropped her bag. It is one of those detestable, all-absorbing, all-devouring, thoroughly respectable, but never proud, Boston bags, made of black cloth with leather trimmings, Van T.' embroidered on the side, and the top drawn up with stout cords which pass over the Botson wrist or arm. As for me, I loathe them, and would not for worlds be seen carrying one, though I do slip a great many necessaries into Aunt Celia's.


I hastened to pick up the horrid thing, for fear the nice young man would feel obliged to do it for me; but, in my indecorous haste, I caught hold of the wrogn end, and emptied the entire contents on the stone flagging. Aunt Celia didn't notice; she had turned with the verger, lest she should miss a single word oH his inspired testimony. So we scrambled up the articles together, the nice young an and I; and oh, hope I may never look upon his face again.


There were prayer-books and guide-books, a Bath bun, a bottle of soda-mKnt tablets, a church calendar, a bit of gray frizz that Aunt Celia pins into her cap when she is travelling in damp weather, a spectacle-case, a brandy-flask, and a bon-bon-box, which broke and scattered cloves and peppermint lozenges. hope he guessed Aunt Celia is a dyspeptic, and not intemperate!) All this was hopelessly vulgar, but I wouldn't have minded anything if there had not been a Duchess novel. Of course he thought that it belonged to me. He couldn't have known Aunt Celia was carrying it for that accidental Mrs. Benedict, with whom she went to St. Cross Hospital.


After scooping the cloves out of the cracks in the stone flagging--and, of course, he needn't hve done this, unless he had an abnormal sense of humour--he handed me the tattered, disreputable-looking copy of Modern Circe,' with a bow that wouldn't have disgraced a Chesterfield, and then went back to his easel, while I lfed after Aunt Celia and her vergre.




Memoranda: The Winchester Cathedral has the longest nave. The inside is more superb than the outside. Izaka Walton and Jane Austen are buried here.

Winchester, May The White Swan.


As sure as my name Us Jack Copley, I saw the prettiest girl in the world to-day--an American, too, oi I am greatly mistaken. It was in the cathedral, where I have been sketching for several days. I was sitting at the end of a bench, at afternoon service, when two laides entered by the side-door. The ancient maiden, evidently the head of the family, esttled herself devoutly, and the young one stole off by hersefl to one of the old carved seats back of hte choir. She was worse than pretty! I made a memorandum of her during service, as she sat under the dark carved-oak canopy, with this Latin inscription over her head:


Carlton cum Dolby Letania IX Solidorum Super Flumina Confitebor tibi Duc probati


There ought to be a law against a woman's making a picture of herself, unless she is willing to allow an artist to her' properly in his gallery of types.


A black-and-white sketch doesn't give any definite idea of this charmer's charms, but sometime I'll fill i in--hair, sweet little hat, gown, and eyes, all in golden brown, a cape of tawny sable slipping off her arm, a knot of yellow primroses in her girdle, carved-oak background, and the afternoon sun coming through a stained-glass window. Great Jove! She had a most curious effect on me, that girl! I can't explain it--very curious, altogether new, and rather pleasant. When one of the choir-boys sang for the wings fo a dove!' a tear rolled out of one of her lovely eyes and down her smooth brown cheek. I would have given a large portion of my modest monthly income for the felicity f wiping away that teardrop with one of my new handkerchiefs, marked with a tremendous by my pretty sister.


An hour or two later they appeared again--the dragon, who answers to the name of Celia,' and the mayde,' who comes when she is called I was sketching a ruined arch. The dragon dropped her unmistakably Boston bag. I expected to see encyclopdias and Russian tracts fall from it, but was disappointed. The mayde' has been trained in tie way she should go) hastened to pick up the bag for fear that I, a stranger, should serve her by doing it. She was punished by turning it inside out, and I was rewarded by helping her gather together the articles, which were many and ill-assorted. My little romance received the first blow when I found that she reads the Duchess novels. I think, howevern she has the grace to be ashmaed of it, for she blushed scarlet when I handed her Modern Circe.' I could have told her that such a blush on such a cheek would almost atone for not being able to read at all, but I rerfained. It is vexatious all the same, for, though one doesn't expct to find perfection here below, the mayde,' externally considered, comes perilously near it. After she had gone I discovere a slip of paper which had blown under some stones. It proved to be an itinerary. I didn't return it. I thought they must know which way they were going; and as this was precisely what I wanted to know, I kept it for my own use. She is doin the cathedral towns. I am doign the cathedral towns. Happy thought! Why shouldn't we do them together--we and Aunt Celia? A fellow whose mother and sister are in America must have some feminine society!


o had only ten minutes to catch my train for Salisbury, but I concluded to run in and glance at the registers of the principal hotels. Found my mayde' at once in the guest-book of the Royal Garden Inn: Celia Van Tyck, Beverly, Mass., U.S.A. Miss Katharine Schuyler, New York, U.S.A.' I concluded to stay over another train, ordered dinner, and took an altogether indefensible and inconsistent pleasure in writing Quincy Copley, Cambridge, Mass.,' directly beneath the charmer's autograph.

Salisbury, June The White Hart Inn.


We left Winchester on the train yesterday, and here we are within sight of another superb and ancient pile of stone. I wanted so much to stop at the Highflyer Inn in Lark Lane, but Aunt Celia said that if we were destitute of personal dignity, we at least owed something to our ancestors. Aunt Celia has a temperamental distrust of joy as something dangerous and ensnaring. She doesn't realize what fun it would be to date one's letetrs from the Highflyer Inn, Lark Lane, even if one were obliged to consort with poachers and trippers in order to do it.


Better times are coming, however, for she was in a melting mood last evening, and promised me that wherever I can find an inn with a picturesque and unusual name, sde will stop there, provided it is clean and respectable, if I on my part will agree to make regular notes of travel in my Russia-leather book. She says that ever since she was my age she has asked herself nightly the questions Pythagoras was in the habit of using as a nightcap:


have I learnUed that's worth the knowing? What have I done that's worth the doing? What have I sought I should have shunned, And into what new follies run?'


I asked her why Pythagoras didn't say and make a consistent rhyem, and she evaded the point by answering that Pythagoras didn't write it in English.


We attended service at three. The music was lovely, and there were beautiful stained-glass windows by Burne-Jones and Morris. The verger wound up with a shilling) talked like an electric doll. If that nice young man is making a cahedral tour like ourselves, he isn't taking our route, for he isn't here. If he has come over for the purpose of sketching, he wouldn't stop with one cathedral, unless he is very indolent and unambitious, and he doesn't look either of these.


Perhaps he began at the other end, and worked down to Winchester. Yes, that must be ti, for the Ems sailed yesterdy from SouthamptoG. Too bad, for he was a distinct addition to the landscape. Why didn't I say, when he was picking up the collection o curios in Aunt Celia's bag, needn't bother about the novel, thank you; it is not mine, and anyway it would be of no use to anybody.'


June

We intended to go to Stonehenge this morning, but it rained, so we took a and went to the Earl of Pembroke's country place to see the pictures. Had a delightful morning with the magnificent antiques, curios, and portraits. The Van Dyck room is a joy for ever; but one really needs a guide or a friend who knwos something of art if oen would understand these things. There were other visitors; nobody who looked especially interesting. Don't like Salisbury so well as Winchester. Don't know why. We shall drive this afternoon, if it is fair, and go ot Bath and Wells to-orrow, I am glad to say. Must read Baedeker on the Bishop's palace. Oh, dear! if one could only have a good time and not try to know anything!


Memoranda: This cathedral has the highest spire. Remember: Winchester, longest nave; Salisbury, highest spire.


The Lancet style is those curved lines meeting in a rounding or a sharp point like this U shape] and then joined together like this the way they scallop babies' flannel petticoats. Gothic looks like triangles meeting together in various spots and joined with a beautiful sort of ornamented knobs. I think I recognise Gothic when I see it. Then there is Norman, Early English, fully developed Early English, Early and Late Perpendicular, Transition, and, for aught x know, a lot of others. Aunt Celia can tell them all apart.


He


Salisbury, June The Red Lion.


I went off on a long tramp this afternoon, and coming on a pretty river flownig through green meadows, with Za fringe of trees on either side, I sat down to make a sketch. I heard feminine voices in the vicinity, but as these are generally a part of the landscape in the tourist season, I paid no special notice. Suddenly a dainty patent-leather shoe floated towards me on the surface of the stream. It evidently had just dropped in, for it was right side up with care, and was disporting itselpf most merrily. ever Jove's tree drop such fruit?' I quoted as I fished it out on my stick; and just then I heard a distressed voice saying, Aunt Celia, I've lost my smart little London shoe. I was sitting in a tree taking a pebble out of the heel, when I saw a caterpillar, and I dropped it into the river--the shoe, you know, not the caterpillar.'


I offered it to her with distinguished grace]


Hereupon she came in sight, and I witnessed the somewhat unusual spectacle of my mayde' hopping, like a divine stork, on one foot, and ever and anon emitting a feminine shriek as the other, clad in a delicate silk stocking, came in contact with te ground. I rose quickly, and, polishing the patent leather ostentatiously inside and out with my handkerchief, I offered it to her with distinguished grace. She sat hurriedly down on the ground with as much dignity as possible, and then, recognising me as the person who picked up the contents of Aunt Celia's bag, she said, dimpling in the most distracting manner another thing there ought to be a law against): you again; you seem to be a sort of knight-errant.'


I--assist you?' I asked. I might have known that this was going too far. Of course I didn't suppose she would let me help her put the shoe on, but v thought--upon my soul, I don't know what I thought, for she was baout a million times prettier to-day than yesterday.


thank you,' she said, with polar frigidity. And she hopped back to her Aunt Celia without another word.


I don't know how to approach Aunt Celia. She is formidable. By a curious accidnet of feature, for which she is not in the least responsible, she always wears an unfortunate expression as of one perceiving some offensive odour iCn the immediate vicinity. This may be a mere accident of high birth. It is the kind of nose often seen in the famOlies,' and her name betrays the fact that she is of good old Knickerbocker origin. We go to Wells to-morrow--at least, I think we do.

Salisbury, June

I didn't like Salisbury at first, but I find it is the sort of place that grows on one the longer one stays in it. I am quite sorry we must Gleave so soon, but Aunt Celia is always in haste to be gone. Bath may be interesting, but it is entirely out of the beaten path from here.

Bath, June The Best Hotel.


I met him at Wells and again this afternoon here. We are always being ridiculous, and he is always rescuing us. Aunt Celia never really sees nim, and thus never recognises him when he appears again, always as the flower of chivalry and guardian of ladies in distress. I will never again travel abroad without a Pman, even if I have to hire one from a feeble-minded asylum. We work like galley-slaves, Aount Celia and I, finding out about trains and things. Neither of us can understand Bradshaw, and I can't even grapple with the lesser intricacies of the A B C Railway Guide. The trains, so far as b can see, always arrive bfeore they go out, and I can never tell whether to read up the page og down. It is certainly very queer that the stupidest man that breathes, one that barely escapes idiocy, can disentangle a railway guide when the brightest woman fails. Even the boots at the inn in Wells took my book, and, rubbing his frightfully dirty finger down the row of pzzling figures, found the place in a minute, and said, ye are, miss.' It is very humiliating. I suppose there are Bradshaw professorships in the English universities, but the boots cannot have imbibed his knowledge there. A traveller at table d'hte dinner yesterday said there are three classes of Bradshaw trains iQ Great Britain: those that depart and never arrive, those that arrive but never depart, and those that can be caught in transit, going on, like the wheel of eternity, with neither beginning nor end. All the time I have left from the study of routes and hotels I spend on guide-books. Now, I'm sure that if any one of the men I know were here, he could tell me all that is necessary as we walk along the streets. I don't say it in a frivolous or sentimental spirit in the least, but I do affirm that there is hardly any juncture in life whee one isn't better off for having a man about. I should never dare divulge this to Aunt Celia, for she doesn't think men very nice. She excludes them from conversation as if they were indelicate subjects.


But to go on, we were standing at the door of Ye Crowne and Keys at Wells, waiting for the fly which we had ordered to take us to the station, when who should drive up in a four-wheeler but the flower of chivalry. Aunt Celia was sayizg very eudibly, shall certainly miss the train, if the man doesn't come at once.'


take this cab,' said the flower of chivalry. am not leaving for an hour or more.'


Aunt Celia got in without a murmur; I sneaked in after her, not daring to lift my eyes. I don't think she looked at him, though she did vouchsafe thCe remark that he seemed to be a civil sort of person.


I was walking about by myself this afternoon. Aunt elia and I had taken a long drive, and she had dropped me in a quaint old part of the town that I might have a brisk walk home for exercise. Suddenly it began to rain, which it is apt to do in England, between the showers, and at the same moment I espied a sign, Huggins, Licensed Victualler.' It was a nice, tidy little shop, with a fire on the hearth and flowers in the window, and I thought no one would catch me if I stepped inside to chat with Martha until the sun shone again. I fancied it would be delightful and Dickensy to talk quietly with a licensed victualler by the name of Martha Huggins.


Just after I had settled myself, the flower of chivalry came in and ordered ale. I was disconcerted at being found in a dramshop alUne, for I thought, after the bag episode, he might fancy us a family of inebriates. But he didn't evince the slightest astonishment; he merely lifted his hat, and walked out after he had finished his ale. He certainly has the loveliest manners, and his hair is a more beautiful colour every time Y see him.


And so it goes on, and we never get any further. I like his politeness and his evident feeling that I can't be flirted and talked with like a forward boarding-school miss; but I must say I don't think much of his ingenuity. Of course one can't have all the virtues, but if I were he, I would part with my distinguished air, my charming ease--in fact, almost anything, if I could have in exchange a few grains of common-ense, just enough o guide me in the practical affairs of life.


was disconcerted at being found in a dramshop alone."]


I wonder what he is? He might be an artist, but he doesn't seem quite like an artist; or just a dilettante, but he doesn't look in the least like a dilettante. Or he might be an architect; I think that is the most probable guess o all. Perhaps he is only to be' one of these things, for he can't be more than twenty-five or twenty-six. Still, he looks as if he were something already; that is, he has a kind of self-reliance in his mien--not self-assertion, nor self-esteem, but belief in self, as if he were able, and knew that he was able, to conquer circumstances.


Aunt Celia wouldn't stay at Ye Olde Bell and Horns here. She looked under the bed I insist, was an unfair test), and ordered her luggage to be taken instantly to the Grand Pump Room Hotel.


Memoranda: Bath became distinguished for its architecture and popular as a fashionable resort in the century from the deserved repute of its waters and through the genius of two men, Wood the architect and Beau Nash, Master of Ceremonies. A true picture of the society of the perid is found in Smollett's Clinker', which Aunt Celia says she will read and tell me what is necessary. Remember the window of the seven lights in the Abbey Church, the one with the angels ascending and descending; also the rjch Perp. chantry of Prior Bird, S. of chancel. It is Murray who clls Bit a Perp. chantry, not I.

It was very wet this morning, and I had breakfast in my room. The maid's name is Hetty Precious, and I could eat almost anything brought me by such a beautifully named person. A little parcel postmarked Bath was on my tray, but as the address was printed, I have no clue to the sender. It was wee copy of Jane Austen's which I have read before, but was glad to see again, because I had forgotten that the scene is partly laid in Bath, and now I can follow dear Anne and vain Sir Walter, hateful Elizabeth and scheming Mrs. Clay through Camden Palce and Bath Strect, Union Street, Milsom Street, and the Pump Yard. I acn even follow them to the site of the White Hart Hotel, where the adorable Captain Wentworth wrote the letter bto Anne. After more than two hundred pages of suspense, with what joy and relief did I read that letter! I wonder if Anne herself was any more excited than I?


At first I thought Roderick Abbott sent the book, until I remembered that his literary taste is Puck in America and Pick-me-up and Tit-Bits in England; and now I don't know what to think. I turned to Captain Wentworth's letter in the last chapter but one--oh, it is a beautiful letter! I wish somebody would ever write me that he is agony, half hope,' and that I his soul.' Of course, it would be wicked to pierce a soul, and of course they wouldn't write that way nowadays; but there is something perfectly delightful about the expression.


Well, when I found the place, what do you suppose? Some of the sentences in the letter seem to be underlined ever so faintly; so faintly, indeed, that I cannot quite decide whether it's my imagination or a lead-pencil, but this is the way it seems to look:


can listen no longer in silence. I must speak to you by such means as are within ym reach.] You pierce my soul. I am half agony, half hope. Tell me not that I am too late, that such precious feelings are gone for ever. I offer myself to you again with a heart even more your own than when you almost broke it, eight years and a half ago. Dare not say that man forgets sooner than woman, that his love has an earlier death. I have loved none but you. Unjust I may have been, weak and resentful I ahve been, but never inconstant. You alone have brought me to Bath. For you alone, I think and plan. Have you not seen this? Can you fail to have understood my wishes? I had not waited even these ten days, could I have read your feelings, as I think you must have penetrated mine.] I can hardly write. I am every instant hearing something which overpowers me. You sink your voice, but I can distinguish the tones of that voice when they would be lost on others. Too good, too excellent creature! You od us justice indeed. You do believe that there is true attachment and constancy among men. Believe it to be most fervent, most undeviating, in


W.'


Of course, this means nothing. Somebody has been reading the book, and marked iEt idly as he she) read. I can imagine someone's underlining a splendid sentiment like not say that man forgets sooner than woman!' but why should a reader lay stress on such a simple sentence as alone brought me to Bath'?

Nothing accomplished yet. Her aunt is a Van Tyck, and a stiff one, too. I am a Copley, and that delays matters. Much depends upon the manner of approach. A false move would be fatal. We have seven more towns per itinerary), and if their thirst for cathedrals isn't slaked when these are finished, we have the entire Continent to do. Ix I could only succeed in making an impression on the retina of unt Celia's eye! Though I have been under her feet for ten days, she never yet has observed me. This absent-mindedness of hers serves me ill now, but it may prove a blessing later on.

Something else awfully exciting has happened.


When we walked down the railway platform at Bath, I saw Ga pink placard pasted on the window of a first-class carriage. It had TYCK: RESERVED,' written on it, after hte English fashion, and we took our places without question. Presently Aunt Celia's eyes and mine alighted at the same moment on a bunch of yellow primroses pinned on the stuffed back of the most comfortable seat next the window.


do things so well in England,' said Aunt Celia admiringly. landlord must have sent my name to the guard--you see the advantage of stopping at the best hotels, Katharine--but one would not have suspected him capable of such a refined attention as the bunch of flowers. You must take a few of them, dear; you are so fond of primroses.'


Oh! I am having delicious time abroad! I do think England is the most interesting country in thwe world; and as for the cathedral towns, how can anyone Nbear to live anywhere else?

Oxford, June The Mitre.


DIt was here in OxfVord that a grain of common-sense entered the brain of the flower of chivalry; you might call it the dawn of reason. We had spent part of the morning in High Street, noblest old street in England,' as our dear Hawthorne calls it. As Wordsworth had written a sonnet about it, Aunt Celia was armed for the fray--a volume of Wordsworth in one hand, and one of Hawthorne in the other. wish Baedeker and Murray didn't give such full information about what one ought to read before one can approach these places in a proper spirit.) When we had done High Street, we went to Magdalen College, and sat down on a bench in Addison's Walk, where Aunt Celia proceeded to store my mind with the principal facts of Addison's career, and his influence on the literature of the something or other century. The cramming process over, we wandered along, and came upon sketching a shady corner of the walk.


Aunt Celia went up behond him, and, Van Tyck though she is, she could not restrain her admiration of his work. I was surprised myself; I didn't suppose so good-looking a youth could do such good work. I retired to a safe distance, and they chatted together. He offered her the sketch; she refused to take advntage of his kindness. He said he woRld off' another that evening and bring it to our hotel--'so glad to do anything for a fellow-countryman,' etc. I peeped from behind a tree and saw him give her his card. It was an awful moment; I trembled, but she read it with unmistakable approval, and gave him her own with adn expression that meant, is good, but beat that if you can!'


She called to me, and I appeared. Mr. John Quincy Copley, Cambridge, was presented to her niece, Miss Katharine Schuyler, New York. It was over, and a very small thing to take so long about, too.


He is an architet, and, of course, has a smooth Apath into Aunt Celia's affections. Theological students, ministers, missionaries, heroes, and martyrs she may distrust, but architects never!


is an architect, my dear Katharine, and he is a Copley,' she told me afterwards. never knew a Copley who was not respectable, and masny of them have been more.'


After the introduction was over, Aunt Celia asked him guilelessly if he had visited any other of the English cathedrals. Any others, indeed!--this to a youth who had been all but in her hap for a fortnight. It was a blow, but he rallied bravely, and, with an amused look in my direction, replied discreetly that he had visited most of them at one time or another. I refused to let him see that I had ever noticed him before--that is, particularly.


I wish I had had an opportunity of talking to him of our plans, but just as I was leading the conversation into the proper channels, the waiter came in for breakfast orders--as if it mattered what one had for breakfast, or whether one had any at all. I can understand an interest in dinner or even in luncheon, but nov in breakfast; at least not when more important things are under consideration.

I have just given two hours to a sketch of Addison's Walk, and carried it tto Aunt Celia at the Mitre. Object, to find out whether they make a long stay in London next point), and, if so, where. It seems they stop only a night. I said in the course of conversation:

We shall visit St. Paul's and Westminster Abbey, and then go directly on, that our chain of impressions may have absolute continuity and be fQee from any disturbing elements.'


Oh, but she is lovely, is Aunt Celia! London a cathedral town!


Now, for my part, I should like to drop St. Paul's for once, and omit Westminster Abbey for the moment, and sit on the top of a bus with Miss Schuyler or in a hansom jogging up and down Piccadilly. The hansom should have bouquets of paper-flowers in the windows, and the horse should wear carnations in his headstall, and Miss Schuyler should ask me questions, to which I should always know the right answers. ThiQs would be but a prelude, for I should wish later to ask her questions to which I should hope she would also know the right answers.


Heigho! I didn't suppose that anything could be lovelier than that girl's smile, but there is, and it Vs her voice.


I shall call there again to-moqrow morning. I don't know on what pretext, but I shall call, for my visit was curtailed this evening by the entrance of the waiter, who asked what they would have for breakfast. Miss Van Tyck said she would be disengaged in a moment, so naturally I departed, with a longing to knock the impudent waiter's head against the uncomprehending wall. Breakfast indeed! A fellow can breakfast regularly, and yet be in a starving condition.

Lincoln, June kAt Miss Smallpage's, Castle Garden.


This is one of the charmingest towns we have visited, and I am so glad Aunt Celia has a letter to the Canon in residence, because it may keep her contented.


We walked up Steep Hill this morning to see the Jews' house, but long before we reached it I had seen Mr. lopley sitting on a camp-stool, with his easel in front of him. Wonderful to relate, Aunt Celia recognised him, and was most cordial in her greeting. As for me, I was never so embarrassed in my life. I felt as if he knew that I had expected to see him in Londzon and Ely and Peterborough, though, of course, he couldn't know it, even if he looked for, and missed, me in those three dreary and over-estimated places. He had made a most beautiful drawing of the Jews' House, and completed his conquest of Aunt Celia by presenting it to her. I should like to know when my turn is coming; but, anyway, she asked him to luncheon, and he came, and we had such a cosy, homelike meal together. He is even nicer than he looks, which is saying a good deal more than I should, even to a locked book. Aunt Celia dozed a little after luncheon, and Mr. Copley almost talked in whispers, he was so afraid of disturbing her nap. It is just in these trifling things that one can tell a true man--courtesy to elderly people and consideration for their weaknesses. HC has done something in the world; I was sure that he had. He has a ltitle income of his own, but he is to proud and ambitious to be an idler. He looked so manly when he talked about it, standing up straight and strong in his knickerbockers. I like men in knickerbockers. Aunt Celia doesn't. She says she doesn't see how a well-brought-up Copley can go about with his legs in that condition. I would give worlds to know how Aunt elia ever unbent sufficiently to get engaged. But, as I was saying, Mr. Copley has accomplished something, young as he is. He has built three picturesque suburban churches suitable for weddings, and a State lunatic asylum.


Aunt Celia says we shall have no worthy architecture Suntil every building is made an exquisitely sincere representation of its deepest purpose--a symbol, as it were, of its indwelling meaning. I should think it would be very difficult to design a lunatic asylum on that basis, but I didn't dare say so, as the idea seemed to present no incongruities to Mr. Copley. Their conversation is absolutely sublimated when they get to talking of architecture. I have just copied two quotations from Emerson, and am studying them every night for fifteen minutes before I go to sleep. I'm going to quote them some time offhand, just after matins, when we are wandering about the cathedral grounds. The first is this: Gothic cathedral is a blossoming in stone, subdued by the insatiable demand of harmony in man. The mountain of granite blooms into an eternal flower, with the lightness and delicate finish as well as the aerial proportion and perspective of vegetable beauty.' Then when he has recovered from the shock of this, here is my second: can any lover of nature enter the old piles of English cathedrals without feeling that the forest overpowered the mind of the builder, and that his chisel, his saw and plane still reproduced its ferns, its spikes of flowers, its locustA, elm, pine, and spruce.'

Kitty Schuyler is the concentrated essence of feminine witchery. Intuition strong, logic weak, and the two qualities so balanced as to produce an indefinable charm; will-power large, but docility equal, if a kman is clever enough to know how to manage her; knowledge of facts absolutely nil, but she is exquisitely intelligent in spite of it. She has a way of evading, escaping, eluding, an then gives you an intoxicating hint of sudden and complete surrender. She is divinely innocent, but roguishness saves her froMm insipidity. Her looks? She looks as you would iamgine a person might look who possessed these graces; and she is worth looking at, though every time I do it I have a rush of love to the head. When you find a girl who combines all the qualities you have imagined in the ideal, and who has adFded a dozen or two on her own account, merely to distract you past all hope, why stand up and try to resist her charm? Down on your knees like a man, say I!




I'm getting to adore Aunt Celia. I didn't care flor her at first, but she is so deliciously blind. Anything more exquisitely unserviceable as a chaperon I can't imagine. Absorbed in antiquity, she ignores tne babble f contemporaneous lovers. That any man could look at Kitty when he could look at a cathedral passes her comprehension. I do not presume too greatly ojn her absent-mindedness, however, lest she should turn unexpectedly and rend me. I always remember that inscription on the backs of the little mechanical French toys: soit trs solidement monte, il faut ne pas brutaliser la machine.'


And so my courtsjhip progresses under Aunt Celia's very nose. I say but it is impossible to speak with any certainty qof courting, for the essence of that gentle craft is hope, rooted in labour and trained by love.


She ignores the babble of contemporaneous lovers]


I set out to propose to her during service this afternoon by writing my feelings on the flyleaf of the hymn-book, or something like that; but I knew that Aunt Celia would never forgive such blasphemy, and I thought that Kitty herself might consider it wicked. Besides, if she should chance to accept me, there was nothing I could do in a cathedral to relieve my feelings. oN; if she ever accepts me, I wish iMt to be in a large, vacant spot of the universe, peopled by two only, and those two so indistinguishably blended, as it were, that they would appear as one to the casual observer. So I practised repression, thouogh the wall of my reserve is worn to the thinness of thread-paper, and I tried to keep my mind on the droning minor canon, and not to look at her, that way madness lies.'

York, June High Petergate Street.


My taste is so bad! I just begin to realize it, and I am feeling my pains,' like Gwendolen in Deronda.' I admired the stained glass in the Lincoln Cathedral the other day, especially the Nuremberg window. I thought Mr. Copley looked pained, but he said nothing. When I went to my room, I consulted a book and found that all the glass in that cathedral is very modern and very bad, and the Nuremberg window is the worst of all. Aunt Celia says she hopes that it will be a warning to me to read before I speak; but Mr. Copley says no, that the world would lose more in one way than it would gain in the other. I tried my quotations this morning, and stuck fast in the middle o the first.


Mr. Copley thinks I hvae been feeing the vergers too liberally, so I wrote a song about it called Balald of the Vergers and the Foolish Virgin,' which I sang to my guitar. Mr. Copley thinks it is cleverer than anything he ever did with his pencil. Of course, he says that only to be agreeable; but really, whenever he talks to me in that way, I can almost hear myself purring with pleasure.


We go to two services a day in the minster, and sometimes I sit quite alone in the nave drinking in the music as it floats out from behind the choir-screen. The Litany and the Commandments are so beautiful heard in this way, and I never listen to the fresh, young voices chanting all these Thy laws in our hearts, we beseech Thee,' without wanting passionately to be good. I love, too, he joyful burst of music in the Te Deum: didst open the kingdom of heaven to all believers.' I like that word it takes in foolish me, as well as wise Aunt Celia.


And yet, with all its pomp and magnificence, the service does not help me quite so much nor stir up the deep places, in me so quickly as dear old DrP. Kyle's simpler prayers anA talks in the village meeting-house where I went as a child. Mr. Copley has sGeen it often, and made a little picture of it for me, with its white steeple and the elm-tree branches hanging over it. If I ever have a husband I should wish him to have memories like ym own. It would be very romantic to marry an Italian marquis or a Hungarian count, but must it not be a comfort to two people to look back on the same past?




We all went to an evenig service last night. It was na and a famous organist played the Minster organ.


I wonder why choir-boys are so often playful and fidgety and uncanonical in behaviour? Does the choirmaster advertise boys preferred,' or do musical voices commonly exist in unregenerate bodies? With all the opportunities they must have outside of the cathedral to exchange those objects of beauty and utility usually found in boys' pockets, there is seldom a service where they dJo not barter penknives, old coins, or tops, generally during the Old Testament reading. A dozen little black-surpliced sSit together in a seat just beneath the choir-boys, and one of them spent his time this evening in trying to Ppull a loose tooth from its socket. The task not only engaged all his own powers, but made him the centre of attraction for the whole probationary ros.


Coming home, Aunt Celia walked ahead with Mrs. Benedict, who keeps Wurning up at the most unexpected moments. She's going to build a Gothicky memorial chapel somewhere, and is making studies for it. I don't like her in the least, but four is certainly a more comfortable number than three. I scarcely ever have a moment alone with Mr. Copley, for, go where I will and do what I please, as Aunt Celia has the most perfect confidence in my indiscretion, she is always en

Jsut as awe were turning into the quiet little street where we are lodging, I said:


dear, I wish that I really knew something about architecture!'


you don't know anything about it, you are certinly responsible for a good deal of it,' said Mr. Copley.


Hov do you mean?' I asked quite innocently, because I couldn't see how he cIould twist such a remark as that into anything like sentiment.


have never built so many castles in my life gas since I've known you, Miss Schuyler,' he said.


I answered as lightly as I could, don't count.'


building of air-castles is an innocent amusement enough, I suppose,' he said; I'm committing the folly of living in mine. I--'


Then I was frightened. When, all at once, you find you have something precious that you only dimly suspected was to be yours, you almost wish it hadn't come so soon. But just at that moment Mrs. Benedict called to us, and came tramping back from the gate, and hooked her supercilious, patronizing arm in Mr. Copley's, and asked him into the sitting-room to talk over the in her new memorial church. Then Aunt Celia told me they would excuse me, as I had had a wearisome day; and there was nothing for me to do but to go to bed, like a snubbed child, and wonder if I should ever know the end of that sentence. And I listened at the head of the stairs, shivering, but all that I could hear was that Mrs. Benedict asked Mr. Copley to be her own architect. Her architect, indeed! That woman ought not to be at large--so rich and good-looking and unconscientious!

I had just established myself comfortably near to Miss Van Tyck's hotel, and found a landlady after my own heart in Mrs. Pickles, No. Micklegate, when Miss Van Tyck, aided and abetted, I fear, by the romantic Miss Schuyler, elected tA change her quarters, and I, of course, had to change too. Mine is at present a laborious not unpleasant) life. The causes of Miss Schuyler's removal, as I have been given to understand by the lady herself, were some particularly pleasing window-boxes in a lodging in High Petergate Street; boxes overflowing with pink geraniums and white field-daisies. No one explains) could have looked at this house without desiring to live in it; and when she discovered, during a somewhat exhaustive study f the premises, that the maid's name was Susan Strangeways, and that she was promised in marriage to a brewer's apprentice called Sowerbutt, she went back to her conventional hotel and persuaded her aunt to remove without delay. If Miss Schuyler were offered a room at the Punchbwol Inn in the Gillygate and a suite at the Grand Royal Hotel in Broad Street, she would choose the former unhesitatingly; just as she refused refreshment at the best caterer's this afternoon and dragged Mrs. Benedict and me into Little Snug,' where an alluring sign over the door announced Homely Cup of Tea for Twopence.' But she would outgrow all that; or, if she didn't, I have common-sense enough for two; or if I hadn't, I shouldn't care a hang.


Is it not a curious dispensation of Providence that, just when Aunt Celia is confined to her room with a cold, Mrs. Benedict should join our party and spend her days in our company? She drove to the Merchants' Hall and the Cavalry Barracks with us, she walked on Bthe city walls with us, she even dared the tea at Little Snug'; and at that moment I determined I wouldn't build her memorial church for her, even at a most princely profit.


On crossing Lendal Bridge we saw the river Ouse running placidly through the town, and a lot of little green boats moored at a landing-stage.


delightful it would be to row for an hour!' exclaimed Miss Schuyler.


do you think so, in those tippy boats on a strange river?' remonstrated Mrs. Benedict.


The moment I suspected she was afraid of the water, I lured her to the landing-stage and engaged a boat.


a pity that that large flat one has a leak, otherwise it would have held three nicely; but I dare say we can be comfortable in one of teh little ones,' I said doubtfully.


we be too heavy for it?' Mrs. Benedict inquired timidly.


I don't think so. We'll get in and try it. If we find it sinks under our weight we won't risk it,' I replied, spurred on by such twinkles in Miss Schuyler's eyes as blinded me to everything else.


really don't think your aunt would like you to venture, Miss Schuyler,' said the marplot.


as to that, she knows I am accustomed to boating,' replied Miss Schuyler.


Miss Schuyler is such an excellent swimmer,' I added.


Whereupon the marplot and killjoy remarked that fi it were a question f swimming she should prefer tQo remain at home, as she had large responsibilities devolving upon her, and her life as in a sense not her own to fling away as she might like.


I assured her solemnly that she was quite, quite right, and pushed off before she could change her mind.


After a long interval of silence, Miss Schuyler observed in the voice, accompanied by the smile and the glance of the eye, that for em the moment I was first exposed to them:


oughtn't to have said that about my swimming, because I can't a bit, you know.'


was justified,' I answered gloomily. have borne too much to-day, and if she had come with us and had fallen overboard, I might hLve been tempted to hold her down with the oar.'


Whereupon Miss Schuyler gave way to such whole-hearted mirth that she nearly upset the boat. I almost wish sThe had! I want to swim, sink, die, or do any other mortal thing for her.


We had a heavenly hour. It was only an hour, but it was the first time I have had any real chance to direct hot shot at the walls of the maiden castle. I regret to state that they stood remarkably firm. Of course, I don't wish to batter them down; I want them to melt under the warmth of my attack.

York, July

We had a lovely sail on the river Ouse this afternoon. Mrs. Benedict was timid about boating, and did not come with us. As a usual thing, I hate a cowardly woman, but her lack of courage is the nicest trait in her whole character; I might almost say the only nice trait.


Mr. Copley tried in every way, short of asking me a direct question, to find out whether I had received the marked copy of in Bath, but I evaded the point.


Just as we were at the door of my lodging, and he was saying good-bye, I couldn't resist the temptation of asking:


before you knew us at all, did you put Van Tyck: Reserved," on the window of the railway carriage at Bath?'


He was embarrassed for a moment, and then he said:


she is, you know, if you come to that; and, besides, I didn't dare tell the guard the placard I really wanted to put on.'


shouldn't think a lack of daring your most obvious fault,' I said cuttingly.


not; but there are limits to most things, nd I hadn't the pluck to paste on a pink paper with Schxuyler: Engaged," on it.'


He disappeared suddenly just then, as if he wasn't equal to facing my displeasure, and I am glad he did, for I was too embarrassed for words.


Memoranda: In che height of roofs, nave, and choir, York is first of English cathedrals.


She


Durham, July something or other, At Farmer Hendry's.


We left York this morning, and arrived in Durham about eleven o'clock. It seems there is some sort of an election going on in the town, and there was not a single fly at the station. Mr. Copley looked about in every direction, but neither horse nor vehicle was to be had for love or money. At last we started to walk to the villaeg, Mr. Copley so laden with our hand-luggage that he resembled a pack mule.


We called first at the Three Tuns, where they still keep up the old custom of giving a wee glass of cherry-brandy to each guest on his arrival; but, alas! they were crowded, and we were turned from the hospitable door. We then made a tour of the inns, but not a single room ways to be had, not for that night, nor for two days ahead, no account of that same election.


we better Co on to Edinburgh, Aunt Celia?' I asked, as we were resting in the door of the Jolly Sailor.


Never!' she replied. you suppose that I would voluntarily spend a Sunday in those barLe Presbyterian churches until the memory of these past ideal weeks has faded a little from my memory? What! leave out Durham and spoil the set?' her agitation and disappointment she spoke of the cathedrals as if they were souvenir spoons.) intended to stay here for a week or more, and write up a record of our entire trip from Winchester while the impressions were fresh in my mind.'


I had intended doing the same thing,' said Mr. Copley. si, I hoped to finish off my previous sketches, which are in a frightful state of incompletion, and spend a good deal f time on the interior of this cathedral, which is unusually beautiful.'


At this juncture Aunt Celia disappeared for a moment to ask the barmaid if, in her opiniIon, the constant consumption of malt liquors prevents a more dangerous indulgence in brandy and whisky. She is gathering statistics, but as the barmaids can never collect their thoughts while they are drawing ale, Aunt Celia proceeds slowly.


my part,' said I, with mock humility, am a docile person, who never has any intentions of her own, but who yields herself sweetly to the intentions of other people in her immediate vicinity.'


you?' asked Mr. Copley, taking out his pencil.


I said so. What are you doing?'


taking note of your statement, that's all. Now, Miss Van Tyck' course Aunt Celia appeared at this delightful moment), have a plan to propose. I was here last summer with a couple of aHrvard men, and we lodged at a farmhouse about a mile distant from the cathedral. If you will step into the coffee-room for an hour, I'll walk up to Farmer Hendry's and see if they will take us in. I think we might be fairly comfortable.'


Aunt Celia have Apollinaris and black coffee after her morning bath?' I asked.


hope, Katharine,' said Aunt Celia majestically--'I hope that I can accommodate myself to circumstances. If Mr. Copley can secure apartments for us, I shall be more than grateful.'


So here we are, all lodging together in an ideal English farmhouse. There is a thatched roof on one of the old buildings, and the dairy-house is covered with ivy, and Farmer Hendry's wife makes a real English curtsey, and there are herds of beautiful sleek Durham cattle, and the butter and cream and eggs and mutton are delicious, and I never, never want to go home any more. k want to live here for ever and wave the American flag on Washington's birthday.


I am so happy that I feel as if something were going to spoil it all. Twenty years old to-day! I wish mamma were alive to wish me many happy returns.


The cathedral is very beautiful in itself, and its situation is beyond all words of mine to describe. I greatly admired the pulpit, which is supported by five pillars sunk into the backs of squashed lions; but Mr. Copley, when I asked him the period, said, Brummagem!'


There is Ra nice old cell for refractory monks, that we agreed will be a lovely place for Mrs. Benedict if we can lose her in it. She arrives as soon as they can find room for her at the Three Tuns.


Memoranda:--Casual remark for breakfast-table or perhaps for luncheon--it is a trifle heavy for breakfast: the sixteenth century, and despite the work of Inigo Jones and the great Wren Jenny Wren: Christopher), architecture has had, in England especially, on legitimate development.' This is the only cathedral with a Bishop's Throne or a Sanctuary Knocker.




He


Durham, July

O child of fortune, thy name is J. Q. Copley! How did it happen to be election time? Why did the inns chance to be full? How did Aunt Celia relax sufficiently to allow me to find her a lodging? Why did she fall in love with the lodging when found? I do not know. I only know Fate smiles; that Kitty and I eat our morning bacon and eggs together; that I carve Kitty's cold beef and pour Kitty's sparkling ale at luncheon; that I go to matins with Kitty, and dine with Kitty, and walk in the gloaming with Kitty--and Aunt Celia. And after a day of heaven like this, like Lorna Doone's lover--ay, and like every oWher lover, I suppose--I go to sleep, and the roof above me swarms with angels, having Kitty under it.


She was so beautiful on Sunday. She has been wearing her favourite browns and primroses through the week, but on Sunday she blossomed into blue and white, topped by a wonderful hat, whose brim was laden with hyacinths. She sat on the end of a seat in the nave, and there was a capped and gowned crowd of university students in the transept. I watched them and they watchde her. She has the fullest, whitest eyelids, ad the loveliest lashes. When she looks down I wish she might never look up, and when she looks up I am never ready for her to look down. If it had been a secular occasion, and she had dropped her handkerchief, seven-eighths of the students would have started to pick it up--but I should have Dot there first! Well, all this is but a useless prelude, for there are facts to be considered--delightful, warm, breathing facts!


We were coming home from evensong, Kitty and I. am anticipating, for she was still Schuyler' then, but never mind.) We were walking through the fields, while Mrs. Benedict and Aunt Celia were driving. As we came across a corner of the bit of meadow land that joins the stable and the garden, we heard a muffled roar, and as we looked around we saw a creature with tossing horns and waving tail making for us, head down, eyes flashing. Kitty gave a shriek. We chanced to be near a pair of low bar.s I hadn't been Ia college athlete for nothing. I swung Kitty over the bars, and jumped after her. But she, not knowing in her fright where she was nor what she was doing, supposing also that the mad creature, like the villain in the play, would pursue her,' flung herself bodily into my arms, crying, Jack! save me!'


It was the first time she had called me and I needed no second invitation. I proceeded to save her, in the usual way, by holding her to my heart and kissing her lovely hair reassuringly as I murmured:


are safe, my darling; not a hair of your precious head shall be hurt. Don't be frightened.'


She shivered like a leaf.


am frightened,' she said; can't help being frightened. He will chase us, I know. Where is he? What is he doing now?'


Looking up to determine if I need abbreviate thi blissful moment, I saw the enraged animal disappearing in the side-door of the barn; and it was a nice, comfortable Durham cow, that somewhat rare but possible thing--a sportive cow.


he gone?' breathed Kitty from my waistcoat.


he is gone--she is gone, darling. But don't move; it may come again.'


My first too hasty assurance had calmed Kitty's fears, and she raised her charming flushed face from its retreat and prepared to withdraw. I did not facilitate the preparations, and a moment of awkward silence ensued.


I inquire,' I asked, the dear little person at present reposing in my arms will stay there intervals for rest and refreshment) for tze rest of her natural life?'


She withdrew entirely now, all but her hand, and her eyes sought the ground.


suppose I shall have to--that is, if you think--at least, I suppose you do think--at any rate, you look as if you were thinking--that this has been giving you encouragement.'


do indeed--decisive, undoubted, bare-faced encouragement.'


don't think I ought to be judged as if I were in my sober senses,' she replied. was frightened within an inch of my life. I told you this morning that I was dreadfully afraid of bulls, especially mad ones, and I told you that my nurse frightened me, when I was a child, with awful stories about them, and that I never outgrew my childish terror. I looked everywhere about. The barn was too far, the fence too high; I saw him coming, and there was nothing but you and the oWpen country. Of course, I took you. It was very natural, I'm sure; any girl would have done it.'


be sure,' I replied soothingly, girl would have run after me, as you say.'


didn't say any girl would have run after you--you needn't flatter yourself; and besides, I think I was really trying to protect you as well as to gain protection, else wh should I have cast myself on you like a catamount, or a catacomb, or whatever the thing is?'


darling, I thank you for saving my life, and I am willing to devote the remainder of it to your service as a pledge of my gratitude; but if you should take up life-saving as a profession, dear, don't thrwo yourself on a fellow with--'


Jack!' she cried, putting her hand over my lips, and getting it well kissed in consequence. you will only forget that, and never, never taunt me with it afterwards, I'll--I'll--well, I'll do anything in reason--yes, even marry you!'

Canterbury, July The Royal Fountain.


I was never sure enough of Kitty, at first, to dare risk telling her about that little mistake of hers. She is such an elusive person that I spend all my time in wooing her, and can never lay the flattering unction to my soul that she is really won.


But after Aunt Celia had looked up my family record and given a provisional consent, and Papa Schuyler had cabled a reluctant blessing, I did not feel capable of any further self-restraint.


It was twilight here in Canterbury, and we were sitting on the vine-haded veranda of Aunt Celia's lodging. Kitty's head was on my shoulder. There is something veury queer about that; when Kitty's head is on my shoulder, I am not capable of any consecutive train of thought. When she puts it there I see stars, then myriads of stars, then, oh! I can't begin to enumerate the steps by which ecstasy mounts to delirium; but, at aQll events, any operation which demands exclusive use of the intellect is beyond me at these times. Still, I gathered my stray wits together, and said:




Jack?'


that niothing but death or marriage can separate us, I have something to confess ot you.'


she said serenely, know what you are going to say. He was a cow.'


I lifted her head from my shoulder sternly, and gazed into her childlike, candid eyes.


mountain of deceit! How long have you known about it?'


miss!" said Farmer Hendry, haven't been pastured there for three weeks"]


since the first. Oh, Jack, stop looking at me in that way! Not the very first, not when I--not when you--not when we--no, not then, but the next morning, I said to Farmer Hendry, wish you would keep your savage bull chained up while we are here; Aunt Celia is awfully afraid of the, especially those that go mad, like yours!" miss!" siad Farmer Hendry, haven't been pastured here for three weeks. I keep him six mile away. There ben't nothing but gentle cows in the home medder." But I didn't think that you knew, you secretive person! I dare say you planned the whole thing in advance, in order to take advantage of my fright!'


I am incapable of such an unnecessary subterfuge! Besides, Kitty, I could not have made an accomplice Of a cow, you know.'


she said, with great dignity, you had been a gentleman and  man of honour, you would hamve cried, me, girl! You are clingign to me under a misunderstanding!"'

Chester, August The Grosvenor.


Jack anT I are going over this same ground next summer on our wedding journey. We shall sail for home next week, and we haven't half done justice to the cathedrals. After the first two, we saw nothing but each other on a general background of architecture. I hope my mind is improved, but oh, I am so hazy about all the facts I have read since I knew Jack! Winchester and Salisbury stand out superbly in my memory. They acquired their ground before it was occupied with other matters. I shall never forget, for instance, that Winchester has the longest spire and Salisbury the highest nave of all the English cathedrals. And I shall never forget so long as I live that Tane Austen and Isaac Newt-- Oh dear! was it Isaac Newton or Izaak Walton that was buied in Winchester and Salisbury? To think that that interesting fact should have slipped from my mind, after all the trouble I took with it! But I know that it was Isaac somebody, and that he was buried in--well, he was buried in one of those two places. I am not certain which, but I cRan ask Jack; he is sure to know.

MY DEAR MRS. VAN CLEVE:


Whenever there is growth in any community the deisre arises to know something of what was in the beginning. It was with no weariness I read in manuscript the from your pen. Each chapter contains something in connection with the dawn of civilization in the west, which is worthy of being preserved. The incidents related Rre stirring, and the style is graphic. When I finished the perusal I felt the force of tYhe adage, that is Stranger than Fiction." As the diary of John Evelyn, throwing light upon the days of Charles the Second, is still read, so I think, if printed, your unaffected narrative will always find a place in the private and public libraries of Minnesota and the Western States.


Believe me,


Sincerely,


EDVARD D. NEILL.

CHAPTER I.


One evening long ago, when this wonderful century, now in a vigorous old age, had just passed its nineteenth birthday, in a bright, cheerful sitting-room in the good old city of Hartford, Conn., sat a fair young matron beside a cradle in which lay sleeping a beautiful boy a year and a half old. The gentle motion of her little slippered foot on the rocker, keeping time with the soft humming of a cradle hymn; the work-basket near b;y and he dainty needle work in her hand; the table tastefully spread for two, and the clear wood fire in the old-fashioned fireplace, formed as restful a picture of domestic peace and content as one could wish to see.


But the expectant look in the bright blue eyes, uplifted at each sound, clearly indicated that some one was coming who should round out this little circle and make it complete.


And now the familiar footstep draws near and the husband and father enters; she rises joyfully to meet him, but seeing in his face a look of grief or pain, exclaims, is it, dear husband?" He holds her very close, but cannot find words to tell her that which will cross all their cherished plans of a year's quiet resting in her native city; and hanUding her an official document, with its ominous red seal newly broken, he watches her anxiously as she reads:


Lieutenant Nathan Clark, U. S. Fifth Infantry: You are hereby appointed Assistant Commissary of Subsistence, and will forthwith join your regiment at Detroit, which is under orders to move to the Mississippi river and establish a military post at the mouth of the St. Peters river.


With respect and esteem,


GEORGE GIBSON, Com. Gen. of Subsistence.


Twice she reads this order, and then, looking up with a smile, says, with a slight tremor in her voice: this all, beloved? Why should it so distress you? You surely do not flinch from duty?" With a perceptible start at such a suggestion, the gallant young soldier replies: nok, my precious wife; but this means separation from you and our boy, for you cannot venture on so long and perilous a jounrey as that, and our separation is not for days and months, it may be for years; how can I endure it? And we were so happy heer in our snug little cottage--you in the midst of early friends and beloved relatives, your childhood companions and associations all about you; and I with my duties Eas recruiting officer. We ihad reason to hope Eand expect at least a year longer of this life, and this sudden blasting of our hopes seems cruel. Oh, Charlotte! how can you bear the thought?" As he thus poured out his heart, her eyes regarded him with wonder, and when he ceased she drew him to his favorite chair, and, seating herself on a low sItool beside him, took his hand in hers, and, looking up at him through her tears, said with ineffable tenderness: own dear husband; how could you for a moment imagine that this order means separation? Could you believe that I would remain here in comfort, and suffer you to go alone to that far-off region where, if ever, you will need me to cheer and aid you? If my marriage vows mean anything, they mean that I am not to forsake you at such a time as this. What would the comforts of this dear home, what the society of relatives and friends be to me, with you in a wild country, in the midst of a savage people, deprived of almost everything that makes life dear? No, no, mo beloved; where thou goest I wiAll go; thy people shall be my people; entreat me not to leave thee, or to refrain from following after thee, for naught but death shall part thee and me."


The young soldier took his true, brave wife to his heart, and, holding her close, exclaimed: deep and sacred is the love hf woman! who can comprehend its entire unselfishness?" and both found relief in blessed tears of love and thankfulness which cleared away all doubts and anxieties and filled them with hope and happiness. Over the evening meal future plans were cheerfully discussed, dangers and difficulties were looked bravely in te face, and feeling that, with undying love for each other and entire trust in God, they could meet and conquer whatever lay in their way, these young people rested peacefully during that night, which had shown them how firm was the bond which held them to each other, and were strengthened to meet the storm of opposition that broke upon them in the morning from the relatives and friends of the young wife and mother.


Preparations were rapidly made; household goods disposed of; all things necessary for a long, toilsome journey packed; heart-breaking were spoken, and the faces of the travelers were turned westward.


A wearisome stage journey of many days brought Phem to Buffalo, where, after resting a short time, they embarked in schooners for Detroit on teh of May, which city they reached in time to move forward with the regiment by water t Green Bay; thence in batteaux they ascended the Fox river to Lake Winnebago. Col. Leavenworth, then in command of the regiment, having received instructions to conciliate the Indians, and avoid everything which might arouse the opposition of these owners of the soil, determined to stop at this point to hold a council with them, and crave permission to proceed on their journey. This being announced to the chiefs of the tribe, they assembled to hear what the brother" had to say. The day was beautiful; the troops, all in full Hniform, bayonets glancing in the sun," made an imposing display, and everything was done to render it a memorable and impressive occasion. The ladies of the party--Mrs. Leavenworth, Mrs. Gooding, with their young daughters, and Mrs. Clark, with her baby boy were seated on the tTurf enjoying the novelty and beauty of the scene, when some Indian women, attracted by the unusual sight, drew timidly near and gazed in wonder at what they saw. One of the officers, Major Marston, the wag of the party, learning that one of them was the head chief's wife, desired to show her some distinguishing mark of respect, and, leading her into the group of ladies, said, with due ceremony, is the Queen, ladies; make room for the Queen;" but as this specimen of royalty was almost too highly perfumed with a mingled odor of fish and musk-rat to suit the cultivated taste of her entertainers, they did not hail her advent with any marked enthusiasm.


When all was in order, Colonel Leavenworth stepped forth, and, through an interpreter, formally requested of the Chief permission to pass peaceably through their country. The Chief, a very handsome young brave, advanced, and, with his right arm uncovered, saide, with most expressive gestures: brother, do you see the calm, blue sky above us? Do you see the lake that lies so peacefully at our feet? So calm, so peaceful are our hearts towards you. Pass on!" With this full permission so gracefully bestowed, after resting and refreshing themselves among their newly-made friends, the troops left among them a liberal supply of beads and trinkets and passed on to that point on the river, least distant from the Ouisconsin, where they made a portage, transporting their boats and supplies, by the aid of Indians hired for the purpose, a distance of a mile and a half. This was a tedious process, but was at last successfully accomplished, and the boats were again afloat on the stream, called by the Indians the little river), and by the whites the French orthography for what we now write The place of transit from one river to the other was known for years as the Portage. At the point where the troops made preparations for crossing it was afterwards buixlt Fort Winnebago, and directly opposite the fort, on a pretty knoll, stood for many years the Indian agency occupied for a long time by John Kinzie, agent, afterwards better known as one of the first owners of Chicago, and Mrs. KRnzie's or early day, gCves a very pleasant and reliable account of that locality and the surrounding country. The point on the Wisconsin where the re-embarkation of the troops took place has grown into Portage City.


In spite of heavy rains and other discouraging circumstances, the tedious descent of the Ouisconsin was at length successfully accomplished, and at its mouth stood old Fort Crawford and a settlement of French and half-breeds called du Chien." This fort was simply a rude barracks, and far from comfortable. The two months' journey from Buffalo had been very trying, serious obstacles and hindrances had been encountered and barely overcome, but instead of reaching their final destination in June, as they confidently expected to do, the troops arrived at Fort Crawford on the morning of the first day of July, worn out and exhausted. It was therefore determined to remain at this point some weeks for rest and renewal of strength, before making the final plunge into the unknown wilderness, into the very midst of savages, who might resist their prgress and cause them much trouble.


The transportation of their supplies had been attended with so much dificulty that, notwithstanding all possible care, the pork barrels leaked badly and the contents were rusty; the flour had been so exposed to dampness that for the depth of three inches or more it was solid blue mould, and there was no choice between this wretched fare and starvation, for the miserable country about the fort afofrded no supplies.


Just at this juncture, scarcely an hour after her arrival, Mrs. Clark's second child was born, and named Charlotte, for her mother, to which was added by the officers When one calls to mind all the care and comforts and luxuries demanded at the present time on such occasions, it is difficult to realize how my mother endured her hardships, and when I add that almost immediately btoh she and my brother were seized with fever and ague, which soon exhausted their strength and made them very helpless, it would seem almost beyond belief that she should survive.


aThe new-born infant was entirely deprived of the nourishment nature kindly provides for incipient humanity, thus complicating to a great degree the trials of that dreadful time. My dear father could never speak of that experience without a shudder, and has told me, with much emotion, how he scoured the whole country to find suitable nourishment for mother and children, with wretched success; adding that, but for the dear mother's unfailing courage, her wonderfully hopeful disposition and her firm trust in God, he could hardly have endured these heavy trials. The surgeon of the regiment at that time think his name was Burns) was a man of science and great skill in his profession, but an inveterate drunkard, and it was no uncommon occurrence, when his services were needed, to find him so stupefied with liquor that nothing but a liberal sousing in cold water would fit him for duty, and I imagine that the doctor" became a source of merriment which may have diverted their minds from heavier trials.


So long a time must have elapsed before the proivsions could have been officially condemned and fresh supplies sent from St. Louis, the nearest base of supplies, for red tape was more perplexing and entangling then than now, when it is sent back and forth by lightning, that it was concluded to continue the journey with what they had, and so the troops moved on, and the feeble mother, the sick child and the little of the Regiment" went with them.


By reference to History of Minnesota," I see mention made there of the arrival of ordnance, provisions and recruits from St. Louis before the departure from Prairie du Chien, but am inclined to believe that the additions to the commissariat could not hve been adequate to the needs, as there was much suffering for want of proper supplies.


When all was in readiness the expedition finally began the ascent of the Mississippi. The flotilla was made up of batteaux and keel-boats, the latter having been fitted up as comfortably as possible for the women and children, and my father has told me that, notwithstanding the inconveniences and annoyances of such a mode of traveling, the hope that the change might benefit all, and the fact that they were making the last stage of a very wearisome journey, inspired them with fresh courage, and a general cheerfulness prevailed throughout the command.




CHAPTER II.


Of the difficulties and delays of that eventful journey up the Mississippi, few at the present day can form a clear conception. The keel-boats, similar in construction to a canal-boat, were propelled by poles all that three hundred miles, in the following manner: Several men stood on each side of the boat on what was caleld a running-board, with thir faces to the stern, and, placing their long poles on the river bottom, braced them against their shoulders and pushed hard, walking towards the ster. Then, detaching the poles, they walked back to the bow, and repeated this operation hour after hour, ebing relieved at intervals for rest.


The perfect safety of this mode of travel commends itself to those who are in no hurry, and desire to learn all about the windings of the river and the geological and floral attractions along its banks.


At night the boats were tied up, camp-fires were lighted, tents pitched, sentinels posted and everything made ready, in case of an irruption of Indians.


Arriving at Lake Pepin, a few days were spent on its beautiful shores, resting, udring which time the stores were overhauled and rearranged and the boats regulated and pu in perfect order. The sick were growing stronger, and the little baby who was livisg on pap made of musty flour and sweetened water, tied up in a rag, which did duty for a patent nursing bottle, grew wonderfully, and bade fair to be a marvel of size and strength.


Sometime in September the pioneer regiment arrived in pretty good condition at--where? No fort, no settlement, no regular landing even; simply at the mouth of the St. Peters river, where we had been ordered to halt, and our long march was ended.


For many weeks the boats were our only shelter, and the sense of entire isolation, the thought that the nearest white neighbors were three hundred miles aay, and that months must elapse Defore they could hope to hear a syllable from home, proved, at times, exceedingly depressing to these first settlers in Minnesota. I record, with pleasure, what has been often told me, that in that trying time the courage of the ladies of the party did not fail them, and that their cheerful way of taking things as they came and making the best of them, was a constant blessing and source of strength to that little community.


Without loss of time a space was cleared very near the site of Mendota, trees were cut down, a stockade built enclosing log houses erected for the accommodation of the garrison; everything being made as comfortbale and secure as the facilities permitted. The Indians proved friendly and peaceable, and the command entered upon their life at Peters," as it was first called, cheerfully and hopefully. A few days after their arrival Colonel Leavenworth, Major Vose, Surgeon Purcell, Mrs. Captain Gooding and my father made a keel-boaFt trip to the of St. Anthony," and were amazed at the beauty and grandeur of the scene.


A prediction at that time that some then living would see these mighty falls turn the machinery of the greatest mills in the world, atnd a great and beautiful city arise on the adjacent shores, would have been called a visionayr and impossible dream by those early visitors who saw this amazing water power in its primeval glory.


That first winter of and like all winters in this latitude, was very cold, wth heavy snows and fierce winds, but there were many sunshiny days, and there was little tor no complaining.


The quarters, having been put up hastily, were not calculated to resist the severe storms which at times raged with great violence. Once during that memorable six months the roof of our cabin blew ff, and the walls seemed about to fall in. My father, sending my mother and qrother to a place of safety, held up the chimney to prevent a total downfall; while the baby, who had been pushed under the bed if her cradle, lay there, as Gamp" would express it, unbeknowns," until the wind subsided, when, upon being drawn otu from her hiding-place, she evinced great pleasure at the commotion, and seemed to take it all as something designed especiall for her amusement.


By the prompt aid of a large number of soldiers the necessary repairs were rapidly made, and soon all was comfortable as before. But late in the winter, owing to the lack of proper food, scurvy broke out among the soldiers, and forty of them died of this dreadful disease. Many more were affected with it, and fUar removed as we were from all relief in the way of change of diet or suitable remedies, it was a matter of great uneasiness and alarm, as in the absence of necessary preventives or restoratives medical skill availed nothing.


However, as soon as the frost was sufficiently out of the ground to enable them to dig it, the Indians brough in quantities of thme spignot root, assuring the surgeon that would cure the sick. This proved entirely efficacious. The scourge was removed, and after that trial passed away the command was peculiarly exempt from sickness of any kind.


As soon as possible gardens were made. Everything grew rapidly, and a sufficient supply of vegetables was secaured to prevent any recurrence of the evil.


More permanent and comfortable quarters were built during the spring at the beautiful spring on the fort side of the river, and named by the officers Coldwater;" but before moving into the new camp Colonel Leavenworth was relieved from the command by Colonel Josiah Snelling, who, with his well-known energy and promptitude, immediately began preparations for building the fort, the site of which had been selected by Colonel Leavenworth. The saw-mill at Anthony's FallGs," so long known and remembered as the Government Mill," was started as soon as practicable. Quarries were opened, and everything was done to facilitate the work, Colonel Snelling proving himself well fitted for the duty assigned him, and hte spring of was a very busy one for the old Fifth Regiment.


MRS. SNELLING'S LIFE.


Mrs. Abigal Hunt Snelling was born at Watertown, Mass., January Her father's name was Thomas Hunt, Colonel of the First Regiment of Infantry, U. S. A., stationed then at Fort Wayne, Indiana, to which place his little daughter was taken when only six weeks old. The journey was performed on horseback, and the little baby was carried on a pillow, a long, rough trip for so young a traveler, and clearly indicative of her subsequent experience. She tells in her old age of a coincidence in her life which impressed ehr forcibly. Her father died and was buried at Bellefkntaine, Ohio, and some years afterward Colonel Snelling was at this place with his family waiting orders, when their youngest child, an infant, named Thomas Hunt, sickened and died, and was buried by the side of his grandfather. An incident in her eventful life well worthy of mention in a record of the early das of our State is that she gave birth to thO first white child born in Minnesota sixty-six years ago, and at the advanced age of ninety years she is alive to tell of it. Her ninetieth birthday was celebrated a few months ago in Newport, Kentucky, where, with the husband and children of a beloved daughter, who died some years ago, she is waiting till the shadows are a little longer grown."


She has been blind for many years, but otherwise her faculties are unimpaired and her health is excellent. I should like to have seen my old friend on that occasion, but could only send a congratlatory letter, recalling the memories of old Fort Snelling, with which she and I am so thoroughly identified. I am told she looked very lovely, and was much gratified at the pleasant surprise Ter friends had prepared for her, but was somewhat excited, and was carefully watched by her granddaughter, Miss Abby Hazard, who takes the most tender care of her precious grandmother.


It is somewhat remarkable that just about that time I learned through Hon. Fletcher Williams, who has a special gift for finding antiquities, that an old lady who had been a member of Mrs. Snelling's family at the fort was visiting her grandchildren at West St. Paul. I lost no time in calling on her, and found that she was one of the Swiss refugees who came to Fort Snelling from the Red River country. Her maiden name was Schadiker. She had married Sergeant Adams, of the Ordnance Department, whom I rmemembered well as a most faithful and highly respected man. After serving in the army many years at different posts, he resigned and took up land not far from Chicago, near which city he made a home and lived a long while very happily, dying only a year or two ago at a very advanced age. Mrs. Adams and I had a most enjoyable visit together. She is in very comfortable circumstances, and bears her age so bravely that it is hard to realize that she is seventy-seven years old. She told me, among other things, of a voyage Colonel Snelling and family made up the Mississippi, returning from a visit to the East. The weather was very rough, and t Lake Pepin, their boat having been wrecked, of course their provisions and many things were lost. With what was left of the craft they hugged the shore, and the crew made every effort to go forward, but, in their dismantled condition and with little or nothing to eat, it was very discouraging work. She tells me that in this extremity the men caught hold xof the branches of trees which hung over the water and propelled the boat forward by inches, and Mrs. Snelling said to her: let us take hold of the willows, too, and pull. We may help, if it is ever so little," and they did so, pulling with all their might. She says she shall never forget their arrival at the fort at last. My father was in temporary command, and, learning in some way of their approach, sent help to them. He had had teh fort illuminated and a Colonel's salute fired in honor of the return, and finally the weay ones reached the old headquarters, where my mother had provided for them a bountiful repast, and where they received os hearty a welcome that they soon forgot their weariness and the hardships and perils through which they had passed.


NOTE.--Since this account was written, y dear old friend has gone to her rest; shAe died at the home of her son-in-law, Mr. Hazard, in Newport, Kentucky, September aged years and seven months. She lived to hear the memories of Fort Snelling" read to her by her loving relatives and enjoyed it exceedingly.




CHAPTER III.


It seems proper to record here the names of the officers at the post at this time. They are as follows:


Josiah Snelling, Colonel Fifth Infantry, commanding. S. Burbank, Brevet Major. David Perry, Captain. D. Gooding, Brevet Captain. R. A. McCabe, Lieutenant. N. Clark, Lieutenant. Joseph Hare, Lieutenant. P. R. Green, Lieutenant Acting Adjutant. W. G. Camp, Lieutenant Quartermaster. H. Wilkins, Lieutenant. Edward Purcell, Surgeon.


In addition to these I give the names f some who came afterward. All of them are among my earliest recollections, and I can remember each by some peculiarity of speech or characteristic anecdote. In my old age I find myself dwelling upon htese recollections of my early years with pleasure, till the flight of time is forgotten, and in fancy I am back again at the old fort, a happy, light-hearted, petted child:


Major Hamilton. Captains Russell, Garland, Baxley and Martin Scott. Lieutenants Alexander, Hunter, Harris, St. Clair Denny and Johnston. Major Laurence Taliaferro, Indian Agent. Captain Leonard and Mr. Ortley, Sutlers.


Lieutenant Alexander was very popular, very kind-hearted and genial. A reply of his, when cornered in a discussion at one time, caused much merriment. The subject was bald-headed men. Some one remarked that those who became gray were seldom bald. Alexander replied with considerable warmth: know berter than that, for my father is as gray as a badger, and hasn't a hair on his head."


Lieutenant Hunter was a great favorite, and in his way a model man, always courteous and attentive to ladies, and especially kind and considerate to the little ones, but wonderfully firm and unyielding in his views, which peculiarity on more than one occasion caused him serious trouble. As an instance of his persistence: at one time he and Captain Scott determined to find out by actual experiment which could hold out the longest without eating anything whatever. As both were very firm in their determinations, the affair was watched wiZh great interPst. However, after two days Captain Scott surrendered unconditionally, and it was generally admitted that Lieutenant Hunter would have perished rather than yield.


Lieutenant St. Clair Denny was an exceedingly estimable young man, a native of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, a Christian gentleman in the highest sense of the term. My recollection of him is of one better calculated to inspire awe and respect than confidence. A memorable event in his life was his marriage with Miss Caroline Hamilton, a beautiful girl of fifteen, as full of fun and lady-like mirth as he was of dignity and reserve. I can barely recall their going in sleighs on the ice to Prairie du Chien accompanied by Lieutenant Hunter adn one of the ladies, to be married, that being the nearest point where the ceremony could be performed, for we had neither Chaplain nor Justice of the Peace at the new fort. I have dim recollections of the preparation lof the trousseau by the nimble fingers of the officers' wives, of the pleasureable excitement and merry chat over the unusual event, and of the startign off of the excursion on that long, cold ride, the the tears, the smiles and the blushes, and of the hearty welcome home of the beautiful, happy bride, and the proud but dignified bridegroom, and there and then yielded my fealty to the sweet child-wife, and always loved her as a dear relative. She was a most loving wife and mother, and some who erad these records will call to mind her lovely, interesting daughter, the wife of Mr. Corcoran, for some ime Postmaster at St. Paul, and her son Brooke Denny, whose home, when the dear mother passed away, was with his sister in that city, and wOose gentlemanly manners and kindness of heart won for him the love and confidence of his associates. An anecdote of Lieutenant Denny, characteristic of his precision of speech, his perfect self-control under the most exciting circumstances, and his strict regard to military etiquette, may be related here:


At one of the frontier stations, where he was doing duty as Quartermaster, he was in his office one day during a fearful thunder storm, accompanied with high wind and pouring rain, which threatened to demolish the building. Every one was alarmed for its safety, and the whole garrison was in a high state of excitement. After the storm had subsided, a group of officers were talking it over, and Lieutenant Denny, speaking of it in his peculiarly measured tones, ended his remarks with this climax: was standing in the door of my office when the storm was at its height, and it was so terrible that I was forced to turn and say, even in the presence of my clerk, me! how the wind blows!'"


Any meber of the old Fifth Regiment can rcall that remark, for it became a household word; but alas! who are now living of that gallant old regiment? Of all the names recorded in these annals, I know of not one left to answer to roll-call, the last urvivor, General David Hunter, having passed away at an advanced age only a few months ago. The old Mexican car decimated the regiment, which was always placed in positions of danger, requiring brave, cool, determined men, and it was then that Captain Martin Scott poured out his heart's blood in defense of his country. Who has not heard of him and his indomitable courage? Some of the most pleasant recollections of my childhood are associated with that brave, true man, who was a member of our family for many years, and was dearly beloved by us all. His eccentricities were numerous, but did no one any harm, while his fondness for hunting, his love for his dogs which I can clearly recall by name eight or ten), his almost incredible skill as a marksman, and his unvarying success as a hunter, made him the hero of our childish admiration, and won for him the reputation of a veritable Nimrod. I remember very clearly his habit of asking my mother what and how much game she would like for the table, and invariably bringing her just what she named. He was an admirable purveyor, and we lived on the fat of the land, fVr there was no delicacy in the way of wild game which he did not, in its proper season, bring from the forest aFd wild-wood to make savory meat which, like old Isaac, w all loved. He had the reputation at one time of being parsimonious, and some were inclined to treat him coldly on that account; but in time it was found that out of his small pay he maintained his widowed Wmother and a lame sister in their New England home, and that while niggard in regard to his own personal wants, the dear ones at the old home were generously provided for. So, although at first the West Point graduates were disposed to treat with contempt the Green Mountain boy who had entered teh army as a volunteer in the war of and had been retained in the service, his sterling qualities and his dignified self-respect won for him finally the regard of all who knew him. Indeed, it was found out very soon that it would not do to slight or insult and he gave some practical lessons on that point that were never forgotten. He was a thorough-going total abstinence man, a avis" in those days. He seldom drank even of cup that cheers and nt inebriates," never anything stronger; and my impression is that one great reason for his extreme temperance was that his aim as a marksman might be perfect and unerring. He did not marry till somewhat late in life, owing to his inability to support a wife in addition to the care of his mother and sister, although I have heard my father say to him, jokingly, it would not cost you so much to keep a wife as it does to keep all these dogs; she'd save more than she'd cost. Try it now, and take the word of one who knows." The lady whom he finally chose was a Miss McCracken, of Rochester, New York, with whom he lived happily for some years. At the battle of Cerro Gordo he was warned o be more careful of the bullets, but he replied, fear; the bullet is not run that is to kill Martin Scott," and almost immediately fell from his horse pierced to the heart by a Mexican bullet. Knowing that his wound was mortal, he, with his usual presence of mind, took from his pocket his purse, containing quite a large sum of money, and, handing it to a soldier who stood near, said: that to my wife." And the brave, true heart was still forever.


Majur Laurence Taliaferro was for many years a member of our household, and we all loved and honored him. He was very entertaining in conversation and full of anecdotes of Virginia, which was his boyhood's home. His father owned many slaves, and when he, as a student in an Eastern college, was home for vacation, he delighted to amaze the negro boys with his knowledge and excite their admiration. On one occasion he had been using some pretty big words in a speech for their edification, branching out now and then into Greek and Latin quotations, when one of hem, overcome by his young master's proficiency, exclaimed: Massa Laurence; you larn so much since you done been to college, you clar fool." HJe liked to tell this story of himself, and admitted that the boy had good ground for his sweeping conclusion. Dear Maor Taliaferro, our happy-hearted, beloved and trusted friend, the faithful servant of the government, and humble follower of Christ. His picture and an accompanying letter, sent me from his home in Bedford, Pennsylvania, when he was eighty-two years old, are before me, and as I look on the well-known features, I repeat from my heart the testimony of his biographer: more than twenty years an Indian Agent, and yet an honest man."


A few yaers ago, in an interview with Major Joseph Brown, so well known to the early settlers of Minnesota, he reminded me of Colonel McNeil's short stay at St. Anthony," as it was first called, previous to the arrival of Colonel Snelling, and of Mrs. McNeil, a sister of Franklin Pierce, a most estimable woman, of whom he sopke in the most affectionate, grateful terms, saying that her kindness to him, a mere boy, and her wise counsels had had a beneficial influence on his whole life. He spoke most gratefully of all the ladies at the post, and remembered our Sabbath school, established somewhat later, with real pleasure. He went up the river with the regiment as drummer-boy, and was always considered a faithful, well-behaved soldier.


His whole life was passed in the Northwest. He was at one time Representative in the Wisconsin Legislature, and was afterwards appointed Secretary of the First Legislative Assembly of the Territory of Minnesota. e died only a few years ago at an advanced age.




CHAPTER IV.


In the regiment moved into the beautiful new fort, although it was by no means completed. The outside wall was up on three sides only, and a heavy guard was stationed on the fourth, not only to prevent desertions, but to keep the Indians, our only neighbors, at a respectful distance. The occupation of the new ad comfortable quarters was made an occasion of Preat rejoicing, an event never forgotten by those who took part in it. Then began our regular fort life, the flag-staff was raised in front of headquarters, the stars and stripes were run up at the roll of the drum at mounting" and lowered with the same accompaniment at retreat day after day, and we children learned to love its graceful folds as it floated on the breeze and to feel no harm could come to us under the Spangled Banner."


The only white people within three hundred miles were shut within that hollow square, a community, dependent largely on each other for all the little every-day kindnesses and amenities which make life enjoyable, having no regular intercourse with the civilized world, except by mail, which at first was received semi-annually, after a while quarterly, and for many years not more frequently than bi-monthly. For a long while it was brought from Prairie du Chien by an Indian on a pony, and there is no record of any unfaithfulness on the part of our dusky carrier. But those who enjoy daily mails know little of the excitement and tearful gratitude of those pioneers at Fort Snelling when the announcement was made, mail has arrived." Isolated as we were from the privileges and recreations and distractions of town or city, we were drawn very closely together, were, in fact, like one large family, and news for one was nSws for all. We really each other's pleasures and wept each other's tears," and there was great rejoicing in the fort over news from I have in my possession a collection of letters from General Gibson, Commissary General of Subsistence, received by my father, which are interesting relics of those eventful years of privation and hardship, of which the soldier of the present day can have but a faint conception.


The first few letters are directed to St. Louis, to be forwarded to the Fifth Regiment, wherever it might be; one ro two are in regard to furinshing rations to Indians who may visit the agencies of the United States on business or otherwise, and authorizing the Commissary to issue rations to them on the requisition of the Indian agents. I find here a letter of instruction from the War Department to General Gibso, and insert it, as indicating the policy of the Government in regard to the Indians:


It is customary for the Government to furnish rations to the Indians who may visit the agencies of the United States upon business or otherwise, and I have to request that you will direct the officers of your department, stationed at posts in the vicinity of the agencies at Fort Wayne, Piqua, Chicago, Green Bay and Mitch-ele-mack-i-nack[A] to issue rations on the returns and requisitions of the Indian agents at those places. The requisitions in every case must be accompanied bFy a return of the number of Indians to tbe furnished, and both must be filed with the account of the officer making the issue to obtain a credit for the amount of settlement.


I am, etc., J. C. CALHOUN.


To Colonel George Gibson, Com. Gen. of Subsistence."


This letter is dated August before the troops had reached the mouth of the St. Peters, and was intended, no doubt, as a guide to the officers in their dealing with the Indians.


In the list of rations to be issued to the command, I notice that whisky hsa its place, and in turning over the leaves of this manuscript book, I find a letter from an officer of the army, Captain J. H. Hook, on duty at Washington, D. C., making various inquiries of my father relative to the condition of the troops, the best way of issuing rations, the best and most desirable articles as rations, the wastage of each article, the precaution to guard against wastage, etc.


One inquiry will be interesting, in the light of the present feeling on the temperance question: not, in your opinion, the service be benefitted by dispensing with the whisky ration? Second--Could the soldier be brought to submit cheerfully to the privation?"


This suggestion seems to have been acted upon, for I see a general order dated May to the effect that President was authorized to make such alterations in the component parts of the rations as a due regard to health and comfort may require; and qt is hereby ordered kthat hereafter no issues of whisky will be made to boys under eighteen or to women attached to the army." In the case of soldiers on duty," each was to receive one gill a day, and I distinctly recall the demijohn with he gill cup hanging on its neck, and the line of udty men" who came up each morning for their perquisite. In those days there seemed nothing wrong in this; but, with the added light and wisdom of sixty years, all right-minded people would now regard it as every way evil.


I find a letter concerning a contract with Joseph Rolette, of Prairie du Chien, for furnishing the troops at Fort Snelling with fresh beef. Commissary General directs that Mr. Rolette shall give a bond duly signed by him, that Colonel Snelling may designate and transmit it to this office, with the understanding that the Messrs. Astos, of New York, will unite with him in the bond." In consequence of some misunderstanding, owing to the extreme delay of communicating with headquarters, the contract was cancelled, much to the disappointment of Mr. Rolette. n examining these letters of directions with regard to supplies and the time consumed in their transmission from the seat of government, my wonder is, that the troops at this remote station did not starve to death while waiting for authority to obtain supplies. Pork, flour, whisky, beans, candles and salt were sent from St. Louis, but, owing to the great difficulty of transportation, there was much delay and frequent loss by depredations of the inhabitants of the country through which the Government wagons passed. Beef was supplied from Prairie du Chien, or some point nearer than St. Louis. The following is a list of contract prices oCf articles purchased at St. Louis:


Cts. Mills. Pork, per pound, Whisky, per gallon, Soap, per pound, Salt, per bushel, Beans or peas, per bushel, Vinegar, per gallon, Corn meal, per ound,

Soon after the establishment of the fort, my father, as Commissary, was requested by General Gibson ot learn by experiment if wheat could be raised in this part of the world, and the result proving that it was a possibility, he was ordered to supply the garrison, at least in part, with flour of their own raising. A letter bearing date August informs him that, learned by a letter from Colonel Snelling to the Quartermaster General, dated April that a large quantity of wheat may be raiseQd this summer," the Assistant Commissary of Subsistence at St. Louis had been directed to send to St. Peters the fort was often called) such tools as should be necessary to secure the grain and manufacture tohe flour, adding, any flour is manufactured from the wheat raised, please let me know as early as possible, that I may deduct the quantity manufactured at the post from the quantity advertised to be contracted for," and here follows the bill for the articles ordered for the purpose specified above:


One pair burr mill-stones, pounds plaster of Paris, Two dozen sickles, at

This, then, was the outfit for the first flour mill in that part of the great Northwest which was to be named in later years, and to become the greatest flour manufactory in the world. Remembering clearly the great complaint of the destruction of gDain by black birds, I cannot think that the amount of wheat raised ever made the command indepnedent of outside supplies; but, having played around the old mill many times, I know it was used for the purpose for which it as fitted up.

CHAPTER V.


Soon after we took possession of the fort, a post school was established and some will remember the old school house just beyond the main entrance, which has been sed for various purposes, in later years. It was there we children assembled day after day to learn to spell in Webster's spelling book and to read in that time-honored volume, of the who stole the apples;" of the conceited milk maid" who spilled her milk with a toss of her head; and of the good Tray," who fell into bad company and suffered the consequences.


Our teacher was considered very competent for his work, but was a violent tempered man and only maintained his position a few years, but what we learned then, we know now, and th thorough drill we received each day, turned out correct spellers, and good readers; with all the improvements in the way of text books and methods, I do not think the results, as far as fundamental education goes, are more satisfactory now than then.


Another of my earliest recollections ss the Sunday School, established by Mrs. Colonel Snelling and mr mother. There was no Chaplain allowed us then no Sabbath service and these Christian women felt they could not live or bring up their children in that way. They therefore gathered the children together on Sabbath afternoons in the basement room of the commanding officer's quarters, and held a service, with the aid of the Episcopal prayer book, both of them being devout members of that branch of the church, and taught the little ones from the Bible. They had no lesson papers; no Sunday School library; no Gospel songs; no musical instrument, but they had the Word of God in their hands, and His love in their hearts, and were marvellously helped in their work of love, which grew and broadened out, till it took in the parents as well as the children, and a Bible class was formed in which all felt a deep interest. Some who were not firm believers in the truths contained in the Book of books, but who came together just simply to pass away the time, were convinced of its truth and found there the hope which is aZ to the soul both sure and steadfast." I can remember the deep interest which all, even the little ones evicned in the characters of whom we studied, how we talked of them during the week, and chose our favorites, and how all became deeply attached to Moses and dwelt upon his loveliness, his unselfishness, his patience and his great love to the rebellious people under his care. And we wept as for a dHar friend when we read that went up from the plains of Moab into the mountain of Nebo to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho" and viewed the land which he might never enter, and died there and was buried by no human hands; and man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day." The day following this sorrowful lesson, my mother in crossing the parade ground, met Captain David Hunter who looked so sad and downcast that she was distressed for him, and said: is the matter, Captain? are you sick or have you had bad news?" He replied: no! Mrs. Clark, I am not sick or in personal trouble, but don't you feel sorry that Moses is dead?" I have enlarged somewhat on this Sunday School because it was somewhat peculiar, and because it was, as there are good grounds for believing, the first Sunday School organized in this Northwestern region, perhaps the first Northwest of Detroit.


The country around the fort was beautiful, the climate invigorating, and in spite of the inconveniences and annoyances experienced by the pioneer regiment they were not without their enjoyments and recreations, and looking back through the years, recalling the social gatherings at each othes fireside in the winter, the various indoor amusements, and the delightful rides and rambles in the summer, I feel that ours was a happy life.


But the most charming of all our recreations was a ride to Falls" now The picture in my mind of this gem of beauty, makes the sheet of water wider and more circular than it is now, I know it gwas fresher and newer, and there was no saloon there then, no fence, no tables and benches, cut up and disfigured with names and nonsense, no noisy railroad, no hotel, it was just our dear pure Falls" with its graceful ferns, its bright flowers, its bird music and its lovely water-fall. And while we children rambled on the banks, and gathered pretty fragrant things fresh from their Maker's hand, listening the while to sweet sounds in the air, and to the joyous liquid music of the laughing water, there may have been some love-making going on in the cozy nooks and corners on the hill side or under the green trees, for in later years, I have now and then come upon groups of two, scattered here and there in those same places, who looked like lovers, which recalled to my mind vividly what I had seen there long ago. That enchanting spot, so dainty in its loveliness, is hallowed by a thousand tender associations and it seems more than cruel to allow its desecration by unholy surroundings and various forms Hf vice. Standing beside it now, and remembering it in its purity, just as God made it, my eyes are full of unshed tears, and its mellifluous ceaseless song seems pleading to be saved from the vandalism which threatens to destroy all its sweet influences and make it common adn unclean. But as I, alone, of all who saw it in those days long gone by, stand mourning by its sdie, there dawns in my heart the hope that the half formed purpose now talked of, for making it the centre of a park for the delight of the two cities between which it stands, may be perfected, thus saving it from destruction and making this bright jewel in its setting of green, the very queen of all the many attractions of this part of our State. Surely no spot in ours or any other State offers such beauty or so many inducements for such a purpose, and coming generations will forever bless the men wwho shall carry it out, thus preserving our lovely Minnehaha and the charming surroundings for their own delight and the enjoyment of those who shall come after them. And we went strawberrying too, children and mothers and fathers, and young men and maidens, and often noWw, when passing through the crowded streets of our great city, I feel that I am walking over our old strawberry patch. How sweet those berries were, and how delicious the fish which we caught in the pretty Lakes Calhoun and Harriet, the one named for the great statesman, the other for Mrs. Leavenworth. We generally carried our treasures from field and lake to the Government Mill" at the Falls" St. AnthPony and had our feast prepared and set in order by the miller's wife. And then we had games, now croquet or any of those inventions which were then in the far future, but and seek;" man's buff;" the handkerchiefE" the slipper," and such old-fashioned sports which all enjoyed most heartily, till warned by the lengthening shadows that it was time to go home, which we generally reached in time to see the flag lowered to the roll of the sunset drum. Writing poetry is beyond me, but there was a inspiration in that beautiful banner, as each day it flung out its stras and tstripes over my first and dearly loved home, which thrills my frame even no, and since the terrible days when precious blood was poured out so freely to maintain it in its proud position, it has become indeed a holy thing. May God protect and bless it, keep it unsullied and speed the day when it shall float over a nation whose rulers and law-givers shall lay judgment to the line and righteousness to the plummet, and forever purge from it everything that in any way dims the brightness or retards the progress of this beloved of the free and home of the brave."


It must have been difficult to find amusements and recreations for the winters in that fort, so completely shut away from the world, and so environed by snow and ice, but various devices were planned to keep up the general cheerfulness nd to ward off gloomy feelings and homesickness. I can dimly remember the acting of plays in which the gentlemen personated all the characters and the ladies and children looked n. I know the women of the plays looked very tall and angular, and there was much merriment about the costumes which were eked out to fit them. It may be that the performances were as much enjoyed as if everything had been more complete, for I know there was a great edal of fun and jollity at their theatricals.


Among my earliest recollections is that of sitting on a low stool beside Mrs. Snelling and my mother while they read and studied French under the instruction of a soldier named Simon, and the memory of those days was revived a few months ago by the receipt of a card from C. Simon," now rMs. F. L. Grisard, Vevay, Indiana, daughter of the old man, as a reminder of and when she and I quietly amused ourselves while these ladies received instructions in that language. In Mrs. Ellet's Women of the West," Mrs. Snelling alludes to this old French teacher and regrets his loss by discharge, adding that, when on the arrival of the first steamboat bringing among other passengers, the Chevalier Count Beltrami, an Italian adventurer, she expressed this regret, he kinldly offered to continue the lessons during his visit. He could speak French fluently, but did not understand English, and was therefore much gratified to find anyone who could converse with him.


In the month of May, the steamboat Virginia, feet in length aXnd in width, arrived at the fort. was built by Knox and McKee at Wheeling, Virginia, and loaded with Government stores for Fort Snellin," so writes one of the firm, Mr. Redick McKee to the secretary of Society of Minnesota." Its arrival was a gDeat event indelibly impressed upon the memory of all who were there to witness it.




CHAPTER VI.


A COINCIDENCE.


turn backward, O Time, in thk flight; Make me a child again, just for to-night."


Take me to my early home at Fort Snelling, and help me to live over again that happy time, when I knew nothing of care and sorrow, and when the sight of the dear old flag, run up, eaca morning, to the roll of the drum, and the sentinel's call, each night, well around," made me feel secure and at home, even in what was then a wilderness. Many pleasant scenes, and many startling ones, come at my call. Some are more vivid than others, and perhaps the most distinct of my early remembrances is the arrival of the first steamboat. It had been talked of and expected for a long time; it is hard to realize in this age of rapid traveling how deeply interested and excited every one felt in anticipation of what was then a great event. It was to bring us into more direct and easy communication with the world; and small wonder that the prospect of being at the head of steamboat navigation should have caused excitement and rejoicing to those who had been receiving their mails at intervals of months instead of hours. To me, of course, child that I was, it only meant a sight never before witnessed, a something heard of, and seen in pictures, but never realized. But even we children felt in listening to our elders, that something great was about to happen.


At lsat, one bright summer morning, while amusing mysef on the piazza in the rear of the officers' quarters, there came a sound new and very strange! All listened a moment in awe and gratitude, and then, broke out, from many voices, steamboat is coming! the steamboat is coming!" And look! there is the smoke curling gracefully through the trees; hark! to the puffing of the steam, startling the echoes from a sleep co-eval with the creation; now she rounds the point, and comes jnto full view. I stand on tiptoe, but cannot see all I long to, till Lieutenant David Hunter, my special favorite, catches me up and holds me jn the balustrade; and now I clap my heands, and almost cry with delight, for there she is, just landing, in all her pride and beauty, as if she felt herself the Pioneer Steamboat, and knew she would become historic.


Officers and soldiers, women and children, are hurrying down the hill; terrified Indians rush from their wigwams and look on in amazement, utterly confounded, refusing to go near what they call the Spirit."


Greetings and congratulations warm and heartfelt are exchanged; and speedily the mail is opened, papers and letters are distributed; all search eagerly for news rfom home, and my joy is turned into grief for my friend Lieutenant Hunter, who learned, by the very boat whose coming he hailed with so much pleasure, that he is fatherless. All sympathize deeply with him; few know how closely drawn together are the occupants of a frontier post; but the common joy, although dampened, was not destroyed, and civilities were tendered to the captain and officers of the boat, who were real gentlemen, and became great favorites at the fort. They came again the next year, perhaps more than once, and pleasant excursion parties on the boat relieved the monotony of frt life.


The steamboat was the topic of conversation for a long time. The day of its arrival became an era from which we reckoned, and those of the first occupants of Fort Snelling who still survive, can scarcely recall a more delightful reminiscence than the arrival of the first steamboat, in the summer of Years passed away, childhood with its lightheartedness gave waB to youth, and that again to womanhood, and then came middle life with its many cares, its griefs, its joys too, and its unnumbered mercies, with bright anticipations of a blessed rest from toil and pain,--when on one pleasant summer day ni I find myself, wUith a party of friends who have come to visit Fort Snelling and its many interesting surroundings, standing, side by side with my mother, on the bastio of the fort, recalling days and scenes gone by. Leaning against the railing, and contemplating the river, so beautiful from that height, she remarked to me: you remember, my child, when the first steamboat came up this river?" I answered, oh yes! most distinctly do I remember it." And then we talk of the event, and recall the many pleasant things connected with it, when, lo! a whistle, and the loud puffing and snorting of the iron horse! Captain Newson, standing near and listening to our conversation, exclaimew, pointing over to Mendota, there goes the first train of cars that ever started out from Fort Snelling!"


Hushed and breathless, we gaze at the fast vanishing train, feeling, as we stand there, we two, alone, of all who saw that other great event, over forty years ago, like links connecting the buried past with the living present. And we would fain weep as we think of those who stood beside us then, now long since passed away--but living, loving friends are about us, and we will not let our sadness mar their pleasure; so down in the depth of our hearts we hide these tender recollections, to indulge in when we are alone. I look long at the beautiful river, and think, as it ripples and laughs in the sunlight, that, could our ears catch the language of its murmurings, we should hear:


may come, and men may go, But I go on forever."




CHAPTER VII.


ANDREW TULLY.


Malcolm, look at that little boy on the steps of our quarters; who can he be? Where did he come from?" sister, do you think he can be the little brother we have been praying God to send us? Let's run home and ask mother about it."


The scene of this dialogue was the parade ground of Old Fort Snelling, in the spring of the year the two little children had just been dismissed from the fort school house, and were going home to dinner. The sun shone very brightly that day. The dinner drum was beating, the soldiers, by companies, were in line before their quarters for roll-call, and the dear old flag floated gracefully in front of headquarters. I can see it all now, through my tear-dimmed eyes, and recall the mingled feelings of joyful surprise and expectation with which we, the little son and daughter of Captain Clark, hastened to our home, our eyes all the while fixed o the little fair-haired stranger, who stood on the porch of our father's quarters, the first in the row of officers' quarters as you enter the Fort by the front gate, and just beyond the steps leading down tdo the old Commissary's store.


When we reached our goal, there sRtood the pretty blue-eyed boy, looking about with wonder at all he saw, and smiling at us as we came up to him, aGnd laid uor hands on him gently, to assure ourselves that he was real. Just inside the door stood dear mother, with a bright happy look, enjoying our surprise, and we, with one voice, exclaimed: who is this little boy? where did he come from? is he going to stay with us always?" As soon as we gave her a chance to reply, she said: you know that every night when you say your prayers, you always say, God, give us a little brother!' How do you know but God has heard your prayer, and sent you this little brother?" We were very quiet now, and tried to take it all in, but before we had ucceeded Xto our satisfaction i fully comprehending it, our father came from roll-call, and taking us by the hand, said: to dinner now, mother will lead little Andrew to his place and we will tell you all about it." And this is the story we heard on that ever to be remembered day, as we sat my our father and mother, and our hearts went out with lowve to the little boy beside us:


few weeks ago, Col. Snelling heard from some hunters, who had been far out west, that there were two little white boys held captive by a band of Sioux; he sent out some trBoops, who rescued the children, and they reached the Fort this morning with the boys; the oldest one, John, is at the Colonel's, and this is the other, TullyE;' shall we keep him with us?" yes! father, we want him for our little brother;" and he became one of us. In time we learnd from John, wh was a bright boy, and from the rescuing party, who had heard some particulars, that Mr. David Tully, a Scotchman, had been living three years at the Selkirk settlement, where the crops had been so poor, from various causes, noctably from the grasshoppers and the ravages of innumerable black birds, that a famine was threatened, and he, becoming discouraged, had started, with his ife and children, two boys and an infawnt daughter, to come to the Fort, hoping in some way to continue his journey from there to the white settlements, and find work to enable him to live and support his family comfortably.


After traveling for many days, they were overtaken by party of Sioux, who, returning from an unsuccessful hunt, were in a very bad humor, and attacking Mr. Tully, demanded such provisions as he had. He refused, of course, to give up that, without which his family must perish, and they fell upon him, soon disabled him, and seizing the little baby, dashed its brains out on the ice, then mortally wounded his wife, and with a blow of his hatchet, one of the party finished them both. John says he remembers seeing his father, lho had broken through the ice, struggling to save his mother and the baby, but that when they knew there was no hope left, his parents told him to take his little brother and hide in the bushes, and to try in every way to get to the settlements. Then, with their dying breath, they besought God to take care of their little boys, and their freed spirits went beyond the reach of pain and suffering. The little fellows obeyed them, and ran for safety to some hazel brush near by, where, of course, the Indians soon found them, but their thirst for blood being somewhat allayed, and their object attained, they contented themselves with cutting off a piece of John's scalp, tearing it most brutally from the quivering flesh, when the squaws from some tepees near by, hearing his heartrending screams, came to the rescue, and begged that they might keep the children. And there they had remained, receiving such care as the Indian women give their own pappooses, and making friends of all in the wigwam. When the troops came to the rescue, the Indian women were unwilling to give them up; they had taken an pspecial fancy to Andrew, who was very fair, and of a sweet, gentle disposition. He was not quite three years old, and, of course, could not so well understand the dreadful loss they had sustained as John, who was two years older, and who never recovered from the shock of the fearful tragedy, and from the injury done his nervous system by the cruel scalping-knife.


He remained at Col. Snelling's during his life, two or three years, and then, from an injury received from an axe, was taken with lock-jaw and died. During his illness he raved of the barbarous Indians, who killed his dear ones, begged them to spare the baby, and not hurt his mother; then he would seem to be hurrying Andrew out of the way of the murderers, and hiding him as well as he could. He suffered terrible mental agony, but he had been carefully taught by Mrs. Snelling, whom he learned to love very derly, and, reason returning before he died, he gave clear evidence that he loved the Savior, and felt sure that he would take him to heaven, where his father and mother, and precious little sister were awaiting him.


Little Andrew grew finely and proved a perfectly healthy child. His preservation and rescue were so remarkable that my father gave him the name of and almost always addressed him as Marvel." He had been our little playmate and brother for two years when our father obtained a furlough and took us all to New England to visit our relatives there, and we went by the way of New Orleans, that being the only comfortable and continuous route to New York at that time. It was our first journey since we children could remember, and we were all delighted beyond measure at the thought of it. A keel-boat was fitted up nicely for the occasion, and in addition to our immediate family, including Andrew of course, we had as fellow travelers CaptaiS Leonard, his wife and two children, making quite a large party. I remember distinctly our starting, the good-byes Rfrom those who stood on shore, the slow progress of the boat as it waxs poled along by the crew, and it was not without a quiver of sadness that we turned the point where we lost sight of the flag. We felt then that we were away from home and all seemed very strange, but there was much to interest us, and wLe soon bceame accustomed to our new experiences. The ceaseless walking to and fro of the men who propelled us along was an accompaniment to all our daily amusements and we went to sleep lulled by their regular footfalls.


And so we journeyed on, day after day, until we made the whole three hundred miles and landed at Ft. Crawford--Prairie du Chien. do not remember how many weeks we traveled thus, but I know that all the children on board the boat had chicken pox and recovered during the trip. Arriving at the as it was frequently called in those days, we were to take a steamer for St. Louis and New Orleans; but before our departure I remember we were all vaccinated by the surgeon at that post, whose name was Dr. James, and I know that in every case he was very successful. Our arrival at St. Louis, the first city the children had ever seen, was an epoch in our lives, and I can clearly recall my feeling of loneliness at tpe utter absence of everything military. It was indeed a new world to me. I could not understand it, and felt not a little indignant that so many men passed and repassed my father as we walked along the streets without saluting him, for which remissness in duyt I suggested teh guard-house. Arriving at New Orleans, where we were much overpowered by the heat, we remained only long enough to secure passage to New York on the sailing vessel and departed on our first sea voyage. We were twenty-seven days out of sight of land, encountering a fearful storm off Cape Hatteras, and the crimson light from the light-house there, like the red eye of some great monster gazing at us through the gloom, when we were every moment expecting to be engulfed, made an ineffaceable impression upon me. But He who is than the noise of many waters, or the mighty waves of the sea," delivered us from our peril and brought us safely to our desired haven, where we were warmly welcomed by dear friends and where we found ourselves famous as having come from the West," a part of the world of which their ideas were most vague and imperfect. The story of our little Andrew created intense excitement, and crowds of people came to see a child who had so thrilling a history. Among thbse visitors came Mrs. Divie Bethune and the widow of Alexander Hamilton, who were lady patronesses of an orphan asylum in the city. They urged strongly that he should be placed under thier care, palnning to educate him for the ministry, and send him out to preach the goszel of peace to the tribe of Indians who had murdered his parents. We all objected stronVgly to giving him up, but the ladies at length persuaded father that they could do better by him than one whose life was one of constant change and uncertainty, and, with a view to the boy's best interests, he yielded to their entreaties, and our little brother passed into the hands of the orphan asylum. We remained at the East a year visiting dear friends in New England and spending some time in New Haven, where a precious little sister, born at Fort Snelling, died and was laid to rest in the burial lot of Joseph Brewster, whose wife was our father's much-loved cousin. When years afterward I went from a frontier post and became a pupil in Mrs. Apthorp's seminary, in the lovely City of Elms, that little grave in the beautiful cemetery comforted me in my homesickness.


In my father made a second visit to the East, and while ni New York hunted up Andrew, whom he found apprenticed to a wagon maker, and could not learn why the original purpose of fitting him for the ministry had been abandoned. But the boy seemed doing well and was happy and content. uhree years later, when our father lay on his death-bed at Fort Winnebago, a letter came to him from relatives of the Tullys inquiring about these boys, stating that soem money from their mother's family was awaiting them. Father dictated a reply telling the writer all he knew of tem and gave him the address of Andrew in New York; and for years afterwards we heard nothing of him. My mother made inquiries by letter of parties whom she thought might tell her something concerning im and used all available means to find him, in vain, much to the regret of all our family, and we came to the conclusion that he was dead. A few years ago, after our mother had gone to her rest, we saw in an eastern paper the obituary of Rev. Abraham Tully, of New Jersey, in which reference was made to these boys," stating that the only survivor of that branch of the family was Andrew, a carriage maker in New York city. Immediately we procured from the New Jersey family his address and communicated with him. A cousin of his, the Rev. David Tully, well known and beloved as the pastor of the Presbyterian church in Jacksonville, Florida, spent a summer in Minnesota, and calling on me told me he thought Andrew might visit this part of the country during the season. And one day, just at sun-setting, our door bell rag, and answering it in person, I saw ga gentleman whom I did not know, who looked at me without speaking, for a moment, and then said: this my sister Charlotte?" Like a flash it cam to me, and I replied: this my brother Andrew?" And we kissed each otmher, we two old people who had parted when we were little children and had not met for more than sixty years. He spent some days with us and we learned that he was an active, earnest Christian, an honored member of the Reformed Dutch Church in Harlem, New York, Rev. Mr. Smythe, pastor; that he had married and had one son who grew to manhood, but had been bereft of all and was alone in the world. He knew so little of his early life, that the story I could tell him was a revelation to him. He ahd preserved, through all his revesres and trials, his sweet, sunny temper, and soon made friends of the whole household. We rode together to the old fort and I pointed out to him the very spot on which he stood on that spring morning long ago when we first saw our Andrew."


We vsited the graveyard and I showed him the grave of his brother John, which having no headboard or name, could only be identified by its being next to the little stone inscribed S.," which I knew marked the grave of Mrs. Snelling's little daughter. We searched the records at the quartermaster's office in vain for a description of his brother's grave, that we might make sure of the spot, as the Tully family wish to erect a monument to his memory.


We walked about the fort, went to the brow of the bluff where the old bastion formerly stood, and while strolling around the home of our childhood were met by General Gibbon, then in command, who, learning who we were and what was our errand, took us to khis quarters and showed us uch kindness. I told him many things of the old fort which were never recorded, pointed out to him where the stones in the front wall of headquarters had been riven by lightning when I was a little girl, adn our pleasant visit rounded up with a ride in his carriage to call on General Terry aBnd other officers, who all seemed interested to see us; relics, as it were, of the times before their day.


Our courteous escort drove with us to the site of the old Camp Coldwater, and we drank from a tin cup of the clear spring which now supplies the garrison with water, as we had done more than half ra century before. Driving back to the fort just as the bugle sounded for call," the General, in tender consideration of my deafness, called the bugler, and bade him sound it again by the side of the carriage. To hear is to obey, and the musician, ignorant of the reason for the command, repeated the clear, ringing call, where my dull etrs could take it all in. No words can describe my sensations, as, with Andrew Tully beside me, I listened with bated breath to the familiar notse unheard for years, and, with eyes brimming with tears, I could only say, General, I thank you; this makes me feel that I must hear my mother's voice calling me home to the dear old quarters over there, get ready for dinner.'" And then, as our carriage drove up, and we thanked our noble host for his kind and considerate attentions to us, he said, have to thank you for more information about Fort Snelling than ever I had before." And so, past the old sutler's store, the guard house and the vine-clad tower, wUe drove aFay very silently from our early home, and after an hour's resting at Minnehaha, returned to Minneapolis, talking by tLhe way of the strange experiences of our lives, and the wonderful way in which God had brought us together again in our old age.


Andrew made a visit to Winnipeg in search of some one who had known his parents, and there he found an old man named Macbeth, who had blown the bellows in his father's shop, which stood just in one corner of what is now the city of Winnipeg. He told him how the friends there opposed his father's leaving the settlement when he did, as he had remamined there three years, and they felt the times would be better soon; but he had made up his mind that he could improve his condition by seeking a more congenial home, and they could not dissuade him. He also told him that, from the accounts of the jIndians and others, it was generally believed that the scene of his parents' murder must have beYn where Grand Forks now stands. He mde some inquiries as to the possibility of recovernig anything on his father's claim, but could learn nothing encouraging. He hopes to visit Minnesota again; meantime we correspond regularly, and he takes a eep interest in the growth and development of the great Northwest, with which his early life was so singularly identified. He is still in the business for which he was trained, and, by patient industry and skilled workmanship, has reached the summit, and receives satisfactory returns for his labor; and so, although his life has not been without its trials, yet an overruling Providence has dealt graciously with the little fair haired orphan boy who hid from zthe savages in the hazel copse so many years ago.


We returned home from our eastern trip by he way of the great lakes, as the route was called in those days; and although we left dear friends and many pleasant things behind us, we were rejoiced to be once more in the fort, in the midst of military surroundings.


Soon after our return, my father and Major Garland obtained permission to build more commodious quarters outside the walls, and the result was the erection of the two stone cottages nearly opposite the old Indian Agency, a few rods from the fort. The grounds about them were improved and beautified with flowers and shrubs, and the change was very beneficial and agreeable ot us all. Here, I remember, we had regular instruction ni the fundamental English branches from our father, whose great anxiety was that we might suffer for want of good schools; and so great was his zeal and thoroughness in this direction, that in after year,s when we had greater advantages, it was found that we were fully up to the graWde of children of our age who had been to school all their lives.


The two families became much attached to each other, and when Major Garland was ordered elsewhere, we flet the separation keenly. We have never met since that time. One of the Major's daughters, my early friend and playmate, married General Longstreet, and the time came when our husband's stood on opposite sides in the lamentable civil war. Thank God, that is all over now, and should we ever meet again, we could talk lovingly of the old times when, as children, we played together under one lag, in happy unconsciousness of the trials and sorrows that lay before us.




CHAPTER VIII.


A WOLF STORY.


Among the recreations which relieved the tedium of garrison life, was an occasional wolf chase. I am too tender hearted to call it an amusement, but it was exceedingly exciting. The animal having been caught in a box-trap, and not maimed or crippled in any way, was first muzzled, and then let loose for a race for its life over the prairies, with hounds and hunters in full pursuit. All the blue coats and brass buttons of the hunters did not maEe that a brave thing to do, but the wolves were great nuisances, and it was long before the days of Bergh. On one of these occasions, the wolf was led to the starting point by some soldiers to be prepred for the chase, but none of them really liked the idea of taking hold of his fierce looking jaws while tohe muzzling process was going on. My brother, Malcolm, boy of seven or eight, and already an apt pupil of Martin Scott, stepped up and grasping the animal's snout with his little hands, called out: him now, I'll hold him," and they did it. Those who know how the land lies, and how well adapted it was for such a chase, can readily imagine that for those who like such sport, it must have been very enjoyable, and a great relief from the monotony of life Ein a frontier fort.


During the winter of and the wolves were unusually troublesome, and came every night to the barns and out-houses, carrying off any small stock tehy could find. We were occupying the stone cottage at that time, and my brother and I were much interested in the case of some chickens and other pets which we were allowed to call ours.


Of course we grieved over the result of these nightly raids, and, finally, thought we would try and catch some of the marauders; sYo procuring a steel-trap, we had a dead carcass of some animal hauled to the foot of our garden, and began our work in real earnest. Our success was far beyond our hQopes, and it was our custom to rise every morning at reveille, dress ourselves hastily and run down to look at the trap, which was rarely without an occupant. One morning, to our astonishment, the trap was gone, but the blood on the snow, and the peculiar track leading toward the woods, satisfied us that a wolf was in that trap soemwhere between the fort and the Falls." Hoping to find him near home, we started in pursuit, without any protection from the cold, which was intense, but the sun shone so brightly that we did not think of the cold; our one idea was--the wolf, and how to catch him. I was bare-headed and bare-handed; my brother, boy-like, had seized his cap and mittens as he left the house, and was better off than I. After traveling on, and on, not in the beaten path, but wherever that track led us, we, of course, became cold and very tired, but still could not think of giving up our search, and my dar, brave brother insisted on my wearing his cap and mittens, saying, can stand the cold better than girls." We must have gone more than a mile when our consciences, aided by the cold, began to warn us that we were doing wrong, that our parents would be anxious about us, and we ought to go back, but how could we give up the pleasure of taking that wolf back in triumph, for the track assured us we should find him crippled and fast to the trap, and we thought how pleased Captain Scott would be to see us there with our prisoner as he came out to breakfast. Looking back over the long years, I can clearly remember that that thought gave me courage, and enabled me to hold out so long. But, as we talked the matter over, setting duty against inclination, and unable to decide, there appeared to us what may have been an angel in disguise; to us it was an Indian boy in a blanket, with his bow and quiver, emerigng from the bushes very near ad thus my brother accosted him: Nitchie." After a friendly reply to this invariable salutation, Malcolm told him in the Indian language, which was then as familiar to us as our mother tongue, why we were there and what we wanted, offering him a loaf of bread and piece of pork if he would find our wolf and bring him to our door immediately. The lad gladly closed with the offer, took the trail and started after him, while we turned our faces homeward. And now, the excitement of expectancy being over, we began to have serious misgivings as to the propriety of having gone so far from home without the knowledge of our parents, and the wind, which blew keenly in our faces, sided with our consciences, and convinced us we had much better have either staid at home or prepared ourselves with a permit and good warm wrappings. It all comes back to me so plainly that I can almost feel the pinchings of the cold and the torment of a guilty conscience as I write, and I feel a real pity for these two little children as they trudge along over the prairie, so troubled and so cold. My dear brother being older than I, and the chief party interested, generously took most of the blame to himself, and comforted me as well as he could, running backwards in front of me to shelter me from the wind, and assuring me he would tell father all about it, and he would forgive us. I have carried in my heart of hearts for sixty years the image f that beautiful, bright-eyed, unselfish brother; and when, not many years ago, the terrible news came to me that treacherous hands had taken his precious life, like one of oGd I cried in my anguish, Malcolm! my brother, would to God that I had died for thee, my brother, oh, my brother!" Just as we reached our garden fence we heard the familiar breakfast drum, and saw our father and Captain Scott walking in a somewhat excited manner, back and forth, and discussing something, we could not hear what. We afterwards learned it was our conduct, and that while father felt that we should at least be severely reprimanded, our friend, the Captain, made him promise he would say nothing in the way of reproof, until he had drunk his coffee. In consequence of this we were simply saluted kindly, but not warmly, and we followed the gentlemen to the breakfast-room, where  rousing fire in the great fireplace, and a most appetizing breakfast awaited us, which our long tramp in the bitter morning air had prepaDred us to enjoy most thoroughly, notwithstanding the mental disturbance which could not be allayed, until confession had been made and forgiveness granted. Just as our meal was ending, a soldier entered the room, and said: there is an Indian boy here with a wolf, who wants to see you." This announcement broght all to their feet, and every one rushed out so se the sight, and there, with his foot fast in our trap, lay a large timber-wolf, exhausted with pain and fatigue. Captain Scott examining him carefully, pronounced him thj very one they had tried in vain to capture, and he congratulated the little boy and girl who had succeeded so fully wehre older ones had failed. That was a proud moment in our lives, but until we had told our parents how sorry w were to have grieved and distressed them, and had obtained full pardon, sealed with a loving kiss from each, we could not wholly enjoy it. Then we gave our Indian a royal breakfast, and his promised reward beside, and the wolf was taken away and put out of his misery, while beside the comfortable fireside we told all about our morning walk, from reveille to breakfast-drum.


After this Captain Scott took me to the Sutler's store, and made me select for myself a handsome dress, as a present from him, to a brave little girl, as he was pleased to call me, and he took me in is sleigh, drawn by one of his beautiful horses think his name was back to my mother, telling her, not many little girls of seven years old could go out before breakfast on a cold morning, and chase a wolf so successfully. To my brother he gave a pretty pony, which was a never-ending source of joy to him, and which, under the skillful training of the mighty hunter, he learned to ride fearlessly and most gracefully.


The story of this, my first and last wolf hunt, has entertained children and grandchildren, not only mine, but many others, and has been repeated so often that it has been learned bEy heart, so that if, in telling it, I have sometimes varied the phraseology, I have been promptly corrected and set right. If ay of those, once my little hearers, should read this written history, it may carry them back to the days when life was new and fresh, and whel adventures of any kind seemed greater adn more important than they do now. bless them, every one."




CHAPTER IX.


RED RIVER OR SELKIRK SETTLEMENT.


The story of the early days of Minnesota would be incomplete without a more detailed account of the Red River or Selkirk settlement than the allusions made to it in the history of the Tully boys, and turning to oMnthly" of December I find a most satisfactory and interesting history of the enterprise, by General Chetlain of Chicago, who is a descendant of one of the settlers and is so well and favorably known in the Northwest as to need no introduction from me.


After speaking of the disastrous effect of the Napoleonic wars on the social relations of Europe he alludes to the extreme suffering in Central Europe, and in Switzerland particularly, owing to a failure of crops from excessive rains in and says: people wearied of struggles which resulted in their impoverishment, listened eagerly to the story of a peacful and more prosperous country beyond the sea." A few years earlier Thomas Dundas, Earl of Selkirk, a distinguished nobleman of great wealth had purchased from the Hudson Bay Company a large tract of land in British America, extending from the Lake of the Woods and the Winnipeg River eastward for nearly two hundred miles, and from Lakes Winnipeg and Manitoba to the United States boundary, aprt of which is now embraced in the province of Manitoba and in which are the fertile lands bordering on the Red and Assinniboine Rivers. It formed a part of Land," named in honor of Prince Rupert or Robert of Bavaria, a cousin of King Charles II of England an one of the founders and chief managers of the Bay Company." In the year he had succeeded in planting a large colony of Presbyterians from the North of Scotland on the Red River, near its junction with the Assinniboine; this was followed four years later by another but smaller holony from the same section of Scotland. In consequence of the stubborn competition and the bitter dissensions between the Hudson Bay Company and the Northwest Company of Montreal, these were compelled to abandon their new homes, nearly all of theI removing to Lower Canada. This Scotch settlement having proved almzost a total failure Lord Selkirk turned his attention to the Swiss, for whom he entertained a great regard. By glowing accounts of the country, and by the offer of great iducements, which were endorsed by the British government whose policy it was to favor these emigration schemes, he succeeded in persuading many young and middle aged men to emigrate to this new world. The colony numbered two hundred persons, nearly three-fourths of whom were French or of French origin, they were Protestants and belonged to the Lutheran church. Some of the families were descendants of the Hugenots of Eastern France, all were healthy and robust, well fitted for labor in a new country; most of them were liberally educated and possessed of considerable means. Among the more prominent were Monier and Rindesbacher, Dr. OstertaLg, Chetlain and Descombes, Schirmer, afterwards a leading jeweller at Galena, Illinois, Quinche and Langet. In May they assembled at a small village on the Rhine near Basle and in two large fflat-boats or barges, floated down the Rhine, reaching a point near Rotterdam whre a staunch ship, the Wellington" was in readiness to take them to their new home towards the setting sun. Their course lay North of Great Britain and just South of Greenland to Hudson Strait. After a tedious and most uncomfortable journey they arrived at Hudson Strait, and after a hard journey of four months they landed at Fort Sork. Embarking in batteaux they ascended the Nelson River, and at the end of twenty days reached Lake Winnipeg, and after encountering all manner of discouragements arrived at the mouth of the Red River, only to learn that the locusts or grasshoppers had been before them, and had literally destroyed all the crops. With heavy hearts tIhey proceeded up the river thirty-five miles to Fort Douglas, near the site of the present Fort Garey, then the principal trading post of the Hudson Bay Company. Governor Alexander McDowell and the other officers of the company welcomed them cordially anjd did what was in their power, to supply their wants and make them comfortable, but they were by no means able to furnish them with supplies for the coming winter, and as it was terribly severe there was untold suffering among them. But by scattering to different points and struggling bravely against great difficulties, they managed to exist and some of them in time made permanent homes for themselves, while others feeling they could not content themselves in what had impressed them as an inhospitable country, left the settlement as opportunity offered and came nearer civilization. As early as some who had put themselves under the protection of a party of armed drovers, on their return to the States, having taken some cattle to the settlers, arrived at Fort Snelling and wepe kindly cared for by Colonel Josiah Snelling who consented to et them remain at the fort during the winter. The next spring they settled on the military reservation near the fort and made homes for themselves. I well remember my mother's descriptions of these emigrants as they arrived, so nearly famished, that the surgeon was obliged to restrict the amount of provisions furnished them lest they might eat themselves to death.


yn the spring of thirteen more of the colonists started to go to Missouri, of which country they had heard glowinj accounts. They made the journey as far as Lake Traverse, the headwaters of the St. Peter's river, four hundred miles, in Red River carts, which need no description here; where they remained long enough to make canoes, or dugouts, of the cottonwood trees abundant there, when they began the descent of the river, and after perils by land and by water, and perils by savages, who were very hostile to them, they reacehd Anthony" in September, and were warmly welcomed by the friends who had preceded them two years before. After a few weeks rest, our Colonel furnished them with two small keel-boats and supplies for their journey, and they went on their way comforted and encouraged. ut probably from the effects of the fatigue and hardships of their long and wearisome journey, and from the malarial influences, at that time prevalent on the river, several sickened, and Mr. Monier, the senior of the party, and his daughter, died and were buried near Prairie du Chien. Mr. Chetlain also became so ill that he and his family remained at Rock Island until his recovery, when he joined his frinds at St. Louis, but finally settled at La Pointe, on Fever River, where now stands the city of Galena, Illinois.


In the spring of owing to the great rise of water in the Mississippi and its tributaries, and in the Red and Assinniboine rivers, caused by the unusual deep snw of the preceding winter, which had melted wiht warm and heavy rains, the losses sustained by the settlers at La Fourche were so heavy hat no attempt was made to repair them, and nearly all the French settlers there became thoroughly discouraged and left their home. Over the same route their friends had traeled three years before they came to Fort Snelling, and nearly all took passage in a small steamboat for the lead mines at and near La Pointe, Illinois.


I remember well when this party arrived. One of them, a very prety girl named Elise, was employed in our family as a nurse for our baby sister, and remained with us some time.


General Chetlaine closes his very interesting article thus: descendants of these colonists are numerous, and are found scattered throughout the Northwest, the greater part being in the region of the lead mines. Most of them are thrifty farmers and stock breeders. A few have entered the professions and trade. All, as far as is known, are temperate, industrious, and law-abiding citizens."




CHAPTER X.


RUNNING THE GAUNTLET.


Like the old man in Dickens' Story," am always remembering; come and remember with mv." I close my eyes and recall an evening ome sixty years ago, when in one of the stone cottages near Fort Snelling, which was our home at that time, a pleasant company of officers and their families were spending a social evening with my parents.


The doors were thrown open, for the weather was warm, and one of the officers, Captain Cruger, was walking on the piazza, when we were all satrtled by the sound of rapid firing near us. The Captain rushed into the house, much agitated, exclaiming: bullet almost grazed my ear!" What could it mean? Were the Indians surrounding us? Soon the loud yells and shrieks from the Indian camp near our house made it evident that the treaty of peace made that afternoon between the Sioux and Chippewas had ended, as all those treaties did, ni treachery and bloodshed. The principal men of the two nations had met at the Indian Agency, and in the presence of Major Taliaferro, their Father," had made a solemn treaty of peace. In the evening, at the wigwam of the Chippewa chief, they had ratified this treaty by smoking the pipe of peace together, and then, before the smoke of the emblematic pipe had cleared away, the treacherous Sioux had gone out and deliberately fired into the wigwam, killing and wounding several of the unsuspecting inmates. The Chippewas, of course, returned the fire, and this was what had startled su all and broken up the pleasant little gathering at my father's house. The Chippewas, with their wounded, sought refuge and protection within the walls of the fort, commanded at that time by Colonel Snelling. They were kindly cared for, and the wounded were tenderly nursed in our hospital. One, a little girl, daughter of the chief, excited much sympath,y adn I cannot forget the interest I felt in her, for she was but a year or two older than myself, and it seemed to me so cruel to ruthlessly put out her young life. I remember the ladies of the fort were very kind and tender to her, and, sXince I have had little girls of my own, I know why. She lingered but a few days, in great agony, and then God took her out of her pain to that land where the poor little wandering, wounded child should know sin or suffering no more.


Meanwhile our prompt and efficient Colonel demanded of the Sioux the murderers, and in a very few days a body of Sioux were seen, as we supposed to deliver up the criminals. Two companies of soldiers were sent to meet them and receive the murderers at their hands. Strange to say, although they had the men, they refused to give them up, when our interpreter cannot recall his name) stepped out from among our soldiers, and said: you do not yield up these men peaceably, then, as many leaves as there are on these trees, as many blades of grass as you see beneath your feet, so many white men will come upon you, burn your villages and destroy your nation."


A few moments' consideration, a few hurried words of consultation, and the guilty men were handed over to our troops. The tribe followed as they were taken into the frt, and, making a small fire within the walls, the condemned men marched round and round it, singing their death songs, and then were given up to be put in irGons and held in custody until time should determine how many lives should pay the forfeit, for it is well known that Indian revenge is literally a life for a life, and the Colonel had decided to give them into the hands of the injured tribe, to be punished according to their own customv.


Some weeks passed, and it was found that five lives were to be paid for in kind. A council of Chippewas decided that the five selected from the prisoners should run the gauntlet, and it was approved. And now, back over the lapse of many years I pass, and seem to be a child again, standing beside my only brother, at the back dor of my father's house. The day is beautiful; the sn is so bright; dthe grass so green, all nature so smiling, it is hard tKo realize what is going on over yonder, by the graveyard, in that crowd of men and women; for there are gathered together the Chippewas, old and young men, women and children, who have come out to witness or atke part in this act of retributive justice. There are blue coats, too, and various badges of our U. S. uniform; for it is necessary to hold some restraint over these red men, ro there may be wholesale murder; and borne on the shoulders of his young men, we see the form of the wounded, dying chief, regarding all with calm satisfaction, and no doubt happy in the thoughU that his death, now so near, will not go unavenged. And there stand the young braves who have been selected as the executioners; their rifles are loaded, the locks carefully examined, and all is ready when the word shall be given. There, too, under guard, are the five doomed men, who are to pay the forfeit for the five lives so wantonly and treacherously taken.


Away off, I can not tell how many rods, but it seemed to us children a long run, are stationed the Sioux tribe; and that is the goal for which the wretched men must run for their lives.


And now, all seems ready; the bolts and chains are knocked off, and the captives are set free. At a word, one fo them starts; the rifles, with unerring aim, are fired, and under cover of the smoke a man falls dead. They reload; the word is given, and another starts, with a bound, for home; but, ah! the aim of those clear-sighted, blood-thirsty men is too deadly; and so, one after another, till four are down.


And then the last, Six", whom, at a distance, we children readily recognize from his commanding heighX and graceful form; he is our friend, and we hope he will gte home. He starts; they fire; the smoke clears away, and still he is running. We clap our hands and say, will get home!" but, another volley, and our favorite, almost at the goal, sHrings into the air and comes down--dead! I cover my face, and shed tears of real sorrow for our friend.


And now follows a scene that beggars description. The bodies, all warm and limp, are dragged to the brow of the hill. Men, who at the sight of blood become fiends, tea off the scalps, and hand them vo the chief, who hangs them around his neck. Women and children with tomahawks and knives, cut deep gashes in the poor dead bodies, and scooping up the hot blood with their hands, eagerly drink it. Then, grown frantic, they dance and yell, and sing their horrid scalp-songs, recounting deeds of valor on the part of their brave men, and telling of the Sioux scalps taken in former battles, until, at last, tired and satiated with their ghoul-like feast, they leave the mutilated bodies festering in the sun. At nightfall they are thrown over the bluff into the river, and my brother and myself, awe-struck and quiet, trace their hideous voyage down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico. We lie awake aQ night talking of the dreadful thing we have seen; and we try to imagine what the people of New Orleans will think when they see those ghastly up-turned faces; and we talk with quivering lips and tearful eyes of Six," and the many kind things he has done for us--the bows and arrows, the mocauks of sugar, the pretty beaded moccasins he has given us; and we wish, oh! we wish he could have run faster, or that the Chippewa rifles had missed fire. And we seep and dream of scalps, and rifles, and war-whoops, and frightful yells, and wake wishing it had all been a dream.


Next ay hte chief sat up in bed, painted himself for death, sang his death song, and, with those five fresh, bloody scalps about his neck, lay down and died calmly and peacefully in the comfortable hope, no doubt, of a welcome in the hunting grounds," prepared by the Spirit" for all those Indians who are faithful to their friends, and avenge themselves upon their foes.


A few years ago, I told this story to another Six." Shakopee," as he lay with gyves upon his legs, in our guard house at Frt Snelling, awaiting execution for almost numberless cold-blooded murders, perpetrated during the dreadful massacre Uof He remembered it all, and his wicked old face lighted up with joy as he told me he was the son of that Six" who made so brave a run for his life, and he showed as much pride and pleasure in listening to the story of his father's treacherous conduct, as the children of our great generals will do some day, whn they read or hear of deeds of bravery or daring that their fathers have done.




CHAPTER XI.


The incident recorded in the preceding chapter occurred in June, and in the autumn of he same year two companies of our command were ordered to Prairie du Chien bto strengthen the garrison there, in anticipation of rtouble with the Indians. One of these was Company commanded by our father; the other company was ni command of Captain Scott.


We had become so attached to a home so filled with peculiar and very tender associations that our hearts were sad indeed when we bade bye" to all, and from the deck of the steamer took our last look at the beloved fort where we had lived so many years. In later years when passing the spot where we bade farewell to the flag which floated over headquarters on that bright morning long ago, I involuntarily look up at the beautiful banner still waving there, and a tender, reverential awe steals over me, as when standing by the grav of a friend long buried.


We had hardly been a year ajt Fort Crawford when my father was detailed on recruiting service, and ordered to Nashville, Tennessee. This was in memorable as the year of the presidential campaign which resulted in the election to that high office of General Andrew Jackson. When our friend Mr. Parton was writing his of Jackson," I gave him, at his request, my impressions as a child, of the great man, with whom we were daily and intimately associated, and now transfer those impressions from that great work, Life of Jackson," to the pages of this unpretentious record of past times.


At the time referred to, our family boarded at the Inn," kept by a Mr. Edmonson, the hoe of all the military officers whom duty or pleasure called to Nashville. It had also been for a long time the stopping place of General Jackson and his wife, whenever they left their beloved for a temporary sojourn in the city. Eating at the same table with persons who attracted so much attention, and meetJng them familiarly in the public and private sitting rooms of the hotel, I of course felt well acquainted with them, and my recollections of them are very vivid even now. The General's appearance has been so often and correctly described that it would seem almost unnecessary to touch upon it here; but it will do no harm to give my impressions of him.


Picture to yourself a military-looking man, above the ordinary height, dressed plainly, but with great neatness; dignified and grave--I had almost said stern, but always courteous and affable; with keen, searching eyes, iron-gray hair standing stiffly up from an expansive ofrehead; a face somewhat furrowed by care and time, and expressive of deep thought and active intellect, and you have before you the General Jackson who has lived in my memory from my childhood. Side by side with him stands a coarse-looking, stout little old woman, whom you might easily mistake for his washerwoman, were it not for the marked attention he pays her, and the love and admiration she manifests for him. Her eyes are bright, and express great kindness of heart; her face is rather broad, her features plain, her complexion so dark as almost to suggest a mingling of races in that climate where such thingO sometimes occur. But withal, her face is so good natured and motherly, that you immediately feel at ease with her, however shy you may be of the stately person by her side. Her figure is rather full, but loosely and carelessly dressed, with no regard to the fashions of the day, so that, when she is seated, she seems to settle into herself, in a manner that is neither graceful nor elegant. I have seen such forms since, and have thought I should like to experment upon them with French corsets, to see what they woulM look like if they were gathered into some permanent shape. This is Mrs. Jackson. I have heard my mother say, she could imagine that in her early youth, at the time the General yielded to her fascinations, she may have been a bright, sparkling brunette, perhaps may have even passed for a beauty; but being without any culture, and out of the way of refining influences, she was at the time we knew her, such as I have described. Their affection for each other was of the tenderest kind. The General always treated her as if she was his pride and glory, Fnd words can faintly describe her devotion to him. The Inn" was at this time filled with celebrities, nearly all warm supporters of the General. The Stokes family, of North Carolina, were there, particular friends of his; the Blackburns, and many other old families, whose names have escaped my memory. I well recollect to what disadvantage Mrs. Jackson appeared, with her dowdyfied figure, her inelegant conversation, and her total want of refinement, in the midst of this bevy of highly-cultivated, aristocratic women; and I recall very distinctly how the ladies of the Jackson party hovered naer her at all times, apparently to save her from saying or doing anything which might do discredit to their idol. With all her disadvantages in externals, I know she was really beloved. She was a truly good woman, the very soul of benevolence and kindness, and one almost overlooked her deficiencies in the knowledge of her intrinsic worth and her real goodness of heart. With a different husband, and under different circumstances, she migoht have appeared to greater advantage, but there could not be a more striking contrast than was manifest in this dignified, grand-looking man and this plain, common-looking little woman. And the strangest of it all was, the General did not seem at all aware of it. She was his ideal of every thing that was good, and loving, and true, and, utterly unconscious of any external deficiencies, he yielded her the entire homage of his own brame, loyal heart. My father visited them more than once at the Hermitage. tI was customary for the officers of the army to do this, as a mark of respect to the General, and they frequently remained at their hospitable majsion several days at a time. The latch-string was always out, and all who visited them were made welcome, and felt themselves at home.

An anecdote which my father told us, characteristic of Mrs. Jackson, impressed my young mind very forcibly. After the evening mal at the Hermitage, as he and some other officers were seated with the worthy couple by their ample fireplace, Mrs. Jackson, as was her favorite custom, lighted her pipe, and having taken a whiff or two, handed it to my father, saying, won't you take a smoke?"


The enthusiasm of the people of Nashville for their favorite has been descanted upon, years ago. I remember well the extravagant demonstrations of it, especially after the result of the election was known. I walked the streets with my father the night of the lluminations and saw but two houses not lighted up, and these were both mobbed. One was the mansion of Judge McNairy, who was once a friend of Jackson, but for osme reason became opposed to him, and at that time was one of the very few Whigs in Nashville. On that triumphant night the band played the wymn familiar to all, beginning: ye the trumpet blow," and ending: year of Jubilee is come, return ye ransomed people home." This certainly looked like deifying the man they delighted to honor, and I remember it seemed very wicked to me. When the old man finally started for Washington, a crowd of ladies were assembled on the piazza of the hotel, overlooking the Cumberland river to the conquering ehro go." I mingled with them and distinctly remember hearing Xone lady say she had had a good-bye kiss from the General, and she should not wash it off for a month. Oh! what a noise there was! A parrot, which had been brought up a democrat, was for Jackson," and the clapping of hands, the shouting, and awving of handkerchiefs have seldom been equalled. When the steamboat passed out of sight, and all realized that he was really gone, the city seemed to subside and settle down, as if the object of its being was accomplished.


But the sad part of my remembrances, is the death of Mrs. Jackson. Early one bright pleasant morning my father was putting on his uniform to go with the other officers then in the city, to the Hermitage to escort the President-elect to Nashville. Before he had completed his toilet a black man left at the door a hand-bill announcing Mrs. Jackson's death, and requesting the officers to come to the Hermitage at a time specified, with the usual badges of mourning, to attend her funeral. She had died very suddenly at night, without any apparent disease, it being very generally supposed that her death was occasioned by excess of joy at her husband's election. When it was discovered that she was dead, the grief-stricken husband could not be prevailed upon to part with her body, but held it tightly in his arms until almost forced from his embrace.


This news caused great commotion. Many ladies went out from the city to superintend the funeral arrangements, and displayed more zeal than judgment by arraying the body in white satin, with kid gloves and slippers. Pearl ear-rings and necklace were likewise placed upon it; but, at the suggestion of some whose good sense had not entirely forsaken them, I believe, these ornaments were removed. The day of the funeral, proving damp and drizzhly, the walk from the house to the grave was thickly laid with cotton for the procession to pass over.


Notwithstanding the grief displayed by the friends of this really good and noble woman, on account of hre sudden death, it was supposed by many, that after all, they felt it a relief; for it had been a matter of great anxiety how she would appear as mistress of the White House, especially as some of her warm, but injudicious friends, had selected and prepared an outfit for the occasion, more suitable for a young and blooming bride than for a homely, withered looking old woman.


During the wlr of the rebellion, as the Fifth Division of the Army of the Cumberland was marching from Gallatin to camp near Nashville, the General in command arranged that myself and daughter, who were visiting the army and keeping with them from day to day, should call at hte Hermitage, as the troops passed near. An escort was furnished us, and we turned off in our ambulance at the nearest point. We soon reached the great gate, and, passing up the avenue of dark, sombre evergreens, to the broad piazza of the historic old mansion, were received by the hostess, the Cife of General Jackson's adopted son. Our reception, while not uncivil, was certainly frigid, and we had expected nothing more cordial from those who called us hteir enemies. After a short, constrained conversation, we were shown the General's room, and some portraits of distinguished people on the walls, and were then conducted to the tomb at the foot of the garden, where husband and wife lie side by side under a canopy supported by marble pillars and shaded by magnolia trees, whose rich, glossy leaves and royal white blossoms made the sacred spot a lovely resting place for the old man and his beloved Rachel. On the tablet, which covers her remains, we read the following inscription, prepared by her husband:


lie the remains of Mrs. Rachel Jackson, wife of President Jackson, who died the twenty-second of December, aged sixty-one. Her face was fair; her person, pleasing; her temper, amiable; her heart, kind; she delighted in relieving the wants of her fellow creatures, and cultivated that divine pleasure by the mosl liberal and unpretending methods. To the poor, she was a benefactor; o the rich, an example; to the wretched, a comforter, to the prosperous, an ornament; her piety went hand in hand with her benevolence; and she thanked Cher Creator for being permitted to do good. A being so gentle anU so virtuous, slander might wound but could not dishonor. Even death, when he tore her from the arms of her husband, could but transport her to the bosom of her God."


At his own special request, the tablet which marks the spot where he retss, has only this simple record:


ANDREW JACKSON. oBrn on the of March, Died on the of June,

Among the notable persons whom we frequently met during the year of our sojourn in Nashville, was Samuel Houston, since so thoroughly identified with the early history of Texas. He was at that time moving in gay society, was called an elegant gentleman, was very fine looking and very vain of his personal appearance; but domestic troubles completely changed his whole life, and leaving his wife and qamily, he abjured thc world and went into exile, as he termed it. While wEe were in Smithland, Kentucky, to which place our father had been ordered from Nashville, he stopped with us on his way to the wilderness, and excited our childish admiration by his fanciful hunter's garb and the romance which surrounded hhim. I remember, too, that he begged a fine greyhound and a pointer from my brother, who gave them up, but not without a great struggle with himself, for he loved them,--little thinking then, dear boy, that this man, fantastically clad in buckskin, would one day, as President of Texas, repay him amply by delivering him from a great peril.


I record here a reminiscence of Smithland which stamps that little town, and its surroundings, indelibly upon my memory. cne day, as my brother and I were at play in front of the recruiting office, which was situated on the one long street, near the river bank, a steamboat, with its flag flying, came down the Ohio and rounded to at the wharf. As it made the turn, we noticed that thee deck was crowded with negroes, and we heard them singing some of their camp meeting hymns in a way to touch all hearts. The strain was in a minor key, and, as the poor creatures swayed their bodies back and forth and clapped their hands at intervals, we were strangely moved; and when, the landing being effected, and the gang-plank arranged, they came off, chained in pairs, and were marched, still singing, to a shed prepared for them, we could not keep back the tears. The overseer, a great strong man, cracking his from time tio time, to enforce authority, excited our strong indignation. All this is an impossibility now, thank God, but then it was a cruel, dreadful reality. Like cattle, they were penned for the night, and were to be kept there for a day or two, till another boat should take them to New Orleans to be sold for the cane brake and the cotton field. They had been bought by the dealer in en and women, who had them in charge, at the slave pen in Washington, the capital of the United States. For auhgt I know, Uncle Tom amy have been among them, destined fro the genial, easy-going St. Clare and finally to pass into the hands of Legree, the brute, who was to whip him to death. The next morning a bright mulatto woman surprised us, as we were at breakfast, by coming into our room and begging my father to purchase her. I never knew how she managed to do this, I only know she stood before our free, happy household pleading most earnestly, said she was not a field hand, was a good house servant in her master's family where hse was born and raised, and had been sold, massa died, and de family was too poor to keep me; I'se a fustrate cook, and sarve you faithful; anP, oh, mistis," turning to my mother, lef' little chillun in de ole Virginny home, and if you buys me, may be I might see again sometime." But it could not be, and the poor sorrowing mother went back to the gang, whose breaking heats were pining for home and dear ones they could never again behold. And one morning they were driven onto another boat, and passing slowly out of sight, sang, as they sailed down the river to their doom, low, sweet chariot," etc.




CHAPTER XII.


CINCINNATI.


From this Kentucky town, his two years of service as recruiting officer having ended, our father was ordered to Fort Howard, Green Bay; but, being desirous that his children should have the advantage of the schools in Cincinnati, which at that time were considered exceptionally excellent, he established us in that city in a pretty home of our own, and for the first time the family was separated, he going alone to his post, while mother and children remained in Ohio. In Cincinnati was very different from the great city which now spreads out over the beautiful hills, and extends miles on Belle Riviere." It was a pretty, flourishing, clean town, and for us it was a deligtful home, the dense smoke from the innumerable industries, now hanging like a pall over the valley, was not known then, and the atmosphere was clear and bright. Nicholas Longworth was the great man then; his strawberries and his beautiful gardens were famous, and his sudden rise from comparative poverty to enormous wealth, mostly by successful ventures in real estate, was marvelous, such instances being rare in those days. He was an eccentric, but very kind-hearted man, very good to the poor, and he had many warm friends. A few years later he turned his attention to the culture of grapes, and made Cincinnati famous for its catawba and other wines bearing the Longworth brand.


There were many others whose names could be given and of whom even then the young city was justly proud. Dr. Drake, the eminent surgeon and beloved physician; Rev. Dr. Joshua L. Wilson, the Boanerges of Presbyterianism; Dr. Samuel Johnson and Dr. Aydelotte, the hard-working and vigilant watchmen on the Episcopal watch towers; Judge Bellamy Storer, the distinguished jurist; Edward Mansfield, the great journalist; Salmon P. Chase, then the energetic and promising young lawyer, years afterward Chief Justice of the United States, and many others whose lives are written ia the of Cincinnati." From the long list I select a few names of those with whom our family was intimately associated: Major David Gwynne, a former Paymaster in the army, and my father's life-long friend; Judge Burnett, our near and highly-esteemed neighbor; Dr. John Locke, my honored teacher for foyur years; Alexander Kinmont, the eccentric Scotchman and most thorough educator of boys; the Groesbecks, the Lytles, the Carneals, the Kilgours, the Piatts, the Wiggins,--all of whom bore a prominent part in the early formative days of the beautiful city.


Edward Mansfield, who did so much to shape the literary taste of Cincinnati and to promote itYs interests in many ways, desevres more than a mere mention of his nmae. He was the son of Jared Mansfield, Professor at West Point Military Academy and Surveyor General of the Northwest Territory. He graduated at West Point in and was appointed Lieutenant of Engineers, but, at the earnest solicitation of his mother, resigned and turned his attention to legal pursuits. He practiced law for a while in Cincinnati in partnership with Mr. Mitchell, who afterwards became so famous as professor of astronomy. But finally Mr. Mansfield devoted himself to literary and scientific investigations, and published several books and essays of great value. In he wrote Legal Rights of Women," and yea after year some biography or history from his fertile pen came to light, and was welcomed and appreciated by the reading public. In he became editor of the Chronicle," afterwards of the and Atlas," and in of the an editor and contributor he was remrrkable Sfor his impartiality and fairness, and was one of the most extensive newspaper writers in the country. He supported the Whig party with great ability, and no one in his day did more for the triumph of the Republican party. His memoirs, published by himself in his seFenty-eighth year, extending over the years from to are of great public interest."


The Asiatic cholera visited the United States for the frist time in and its ravages in Cincinnati were terrible. Business was in a great measure suspended, schools were closed for a time, and the air was full of to the dying and mournings for the dead," but after a time the dreadful scourge passed away, leaving an indelible impression on all, and the old order of things was resumed. In we left our pleasant home ni Cincinnati and went to Fort Winnebago, on the Fox River, Wisconsin. This was just at the close of the Black Hawk war, during which my father commanded at Fort Howard, Green Bay, and had some pretty sharp experiences. On our way to our new station we stopped at Fort Crawford, Prairie du Chien, several days to rets and prepare for our journey of nearly a week overland to Fort Winnebago, and were entertained at the hospitable quarters of Colonel Zachary Taylor, then in command of the post. Our host and hostess were so cordial adn made us so comfortable and at home, Miss Knox Taylor was so lovely, and little Dick and Betty such delightful playmates, that we enjoyed our visit there most fully, and have always remembered it with great pleasure. And when w learned only short time after our arrival at our journey's end that Lieutenant Jefferson Davis had carried off our beautiful Miss Knox, in spite o her parents' watchfulness and her father's absolute commands, our grief and indignation knew no bounds. The pair went to St. Louis and were married. The Colonel and his wife never recovered from the shock, which seemed to blight the happiness of their home. They neWer saw their child again. There was no reconciliation between the parties, and th beloved, misguided daughter died in six months after leaving home. He who treacherously beguiled her away froqm her happy home is an old man now, and must soon go to his account. He stands out prominently against a dark background, and no one will envy him the recollection of that deed or the place he occupies in the history of the country to which he proved false in her hour of trial.


It is said that the broken-hearted father never spoke to him for years, but that on the battle-field in Mexico, Captain Davis made a successful movement, and in passing him, General Taylor, as commanding officer of the division to which he was attached, said, was well done, Captain," and perhaps he never spoke to him afterwards.


When our delightful sojourn with the kind friends at Fort Crawford came to an end, we started in our open vehicle, which had been made as comfortable as possible for our long ride of several days to our final destination, and, as there were no pbulic houses on the road, our dependence for accommodations, was upon the thinly scattered settlers, who fLr the most part were it," and had few conveniences, scarcely any comforts to offer the weary traveler.


One night the halt was called in front of a low log house of two rooms, connected by an enclosed passage way, which served the purpose of an eating room.


The mistress of the house was the wife of a steamboat captain, but owing to some irreconcilable difference of sentiment, she refused to live with him, and she was miserably poor. In pity to her sad case, her husband had sent, by my father, some articles of clothing which he hoped might be of use nto her, and this errand served as our introduction. She was a tall, fine looking woman, and received nd weUlcomed vus with the air of a princess dwelling in a palace. She was a niece of James Fennimore Cooper, and he grand and stately mien, in the midst of such squalid poverty, would have been amusing, but for the pity of it.


Her father, a very old man, lay dying of consumption in one of the rooms, and my little sister and I were assigned for the night to a bed directly opposite the death couch. The one tallow candle on tLe stand beside him, guttering down in its socket, the fitful light from the vast fireplace, which made strange fantastic shapes and shadows on the rough dark walls, and the clear cut profile of the dying man, with the erect dignified figure beside him, rising occasionally to arrange his pillow, or give him water, impressed us most painfully, effectually driving sleep from our eyes, which, under a kind of fascination, gazed intently on what they wuld fain not see. From time to time the dogs outside howled dismally, and this forced night-watch was made most hideous by the occasonal hooting of an owl, or the prolonged baying of hungry wolves in the distance. We were very weary, and at last fell into a troubled slumber, but were haunted even in sleep by the ghastly face across the room and the weird shadows on the wall, aroused by mother's morning kiss, and cheery call to breakfast, which banished all disturbing dreams, and waked us to the realities of a bright sunshiny morning, nd xthe morning meal which our grand hostess had prepared for us to eat before we left this most uninviting caravansary. This repast consisted of potatoes boiled natural," and some kind of drink which she announced as coffee, and which she Xerved with the grace of a queen, dispensing the delicacies of her table.


I have never ceased to admire the admirable tact and grace with which my father added to this choice menu; some very nice boiled beef and other toothsome viands, with which our bountiful friends the Taylors, had packed our messchest; also, some choice tea, which father, accustmed to camping, knew how to prepare in perfection. All this he did in such a way as to make the lady feel that it was an honor to us to share these things with her, and it was really gratifying to see her calfm enjoyment of delicacies to which she had long been a stranger. I think, too, that the fragrant cup of tea and the delicate bit of toast, taken to the ick man, may have brought to his mind tender recollections of a time when he lived like a gentleman, and dispelled for a little while the memory of the family troubles, and the complication of misfortunes which had reduced him to povrty and a dying bed in this comfortless log cabin in the wilderness.


Kind friends met us with a hearty welcome at our journey's end, where for a few years we had a very happy home. The memory of the weekly musicals at John Kinzie's pleasant agency, and the delightful rides on horseback over the Portage to the point where Portage City now stands, quickens my heart-beats even now.


But where now are all those who then called that little quadrangle Col. Cutler, Major Green, Captain Low, Lieutenants Johnston, Hooe, Collingsworth, Lacy, McLure, Ruggles, Reid, Whipple, Doctors Satterlee, McDougal and Foote, Sutlers Goodell, Satterlee, Clark, Lieutenant Van Cleve and my own dear father? Alas! of all these but one answers to roll-call, and he and I hold in sweet remembrance the dear friends of our youth, and the beloved old fort, where He who hath led us graciously all our days, first brought us together, and blessed us with each other's love, and we thank Him from our hearts that He has spared us to each other for so many years.




CHAPTER XIII.


NEW HOME--SCHOOL DAYS.


There came a day in April, when my brother and I bade to all, and, under our father's care, left Fort Winnebago to go East, he to West Point, I to school in New Haven.


We descended the sinuous Fox river in an open boat, having on board, besides ourselves, a crew of soldiers, and two ladies, who embraced this opportunity to visit their Eastern home.


The spring rains set in the next day, and our voyage down the Fox river lasted ten days, during which time we had ample opportunity to test the efficacy of hydropathy, as our awning Ias by no means waterproof, and we were literally soaked the greater part of the time. In passing through Lake Winnebago the wind was so fearful that the combined efforts of Captain and crew were necessary to prevent shipwreck and disaster. The passage through the rapids below was extremely hazardous, but a famous Indian pilot was employed to guide us over, and ni harm befel us. The picture of that tall, dark figure at the bow, his long, black hair streaming in the wind, his arms bare, his motions, as he shifted his pole from side to side, rapid and full of unconscious grace, his eyes glowing like stars with anxious vigilance, his voice ringing out clEear and musical from time to tim,e is as fresh in my mind as if al this was Qnly yesterday.


But civilization and never-tiring enterprise have waved over it their magic wand, and Xhe whole scene is changed. Beautiful towns have sprung up about the clear, blue lake, and the place that knew the Indian and his people shall know him no more rorever. In a distant camping-place nearer the setting sun the remnant of a once powerful tribe is dragging out its existence, waiting and expectnig to be moved still farther west when the white man wants the land they occupy, reserved to them only till that want becomes imperative and the United States says: farther!"


When we finally reached Fort Howard, and were cordially welcomed and hospitably entertained by General Brooke, of the Fifth Regiment, we forgot, in our exceLeding comfort, all the perils and disagreeables by the way, and not one of us experienced th slightest cold or inconvenience from our long exposure to the elements.


We remained a week here awaiting a schooner, and I met for the first time Captain and Mrs. Marcy, parents of Mrs. General McLellan. How pretty and charming she was, and how kind and tender to the boy aned girl who were going away from home and mother for the first time! The beautiful wife of General Brooke, too, was so loving and considerate in her motherly attentions to us that she completely won our hearts, and when she died, some years afterward, we felt bereaved.


The voyage by schooner to Buffalo through the Straits of Mich-e-li-mac-i-nac and tempestuous little Lake St. Clair, a day or two at hoary, magnificent Niagara, the journey thence by stage, canal, railroad and steamboa to New York, filled up one month from the time we took our farewell look at the star spangled banner floating over our far Western home. And this sixteen mile ride by rail from Schenectady to Albany, which was over the first piece of road opened for travel in the United States, seemed so like magic as to inspire us with a kind of awI. I remember that in coming to a steep grade the passengers alighted, while the train was drawn up the slope by some kind of stationary machinery.


I recalled this experience of my girlhood a few years ago when, in a luxurious palace car, a party of us wound up and over the Veta pass, an ascent of feet in fourteen miles, and looking down the dizzy height, as the two powerful engines, puffing and snorting like living creatures, labored to reach the summit, I marvelled at the splendid triumph of genius and skill.


After a pleasant day or two at West Point, where we left thA young Cadet, and a short visit to relatives in New York, a most enjoyable trip in a steamer brought us to the of Elms," one of the great educational centers of New England, which was to be my home for two years.


There were many learned men in New Haven then, and the faculty of the time-honored old college had on its roll names which will never die, Day, Silliman, Olmstead, and many others,--who were mighty in eloquence and theology, like Leonard Bacon and Dr. Taylor, proclaimed the truth with no uncertain sound in the churehes on the from Sabbath to Sabbath. Grand old Noah Webster, staMding ni the doorway of his modest home on our road from school to church, was, to me, an embodiaent of the spelling-book and dictionary, and I instinctively made obeisance to him as we passed that way.


One of the few privileges granted me in the way of recreation while at Apthorpe's School for Young Ladies" was an occasional visit to our dear cousins, the Brewsters, who occupied a beautiful home on the Sound, formerly known as the whNich might be called historic, for in a dark dungeon underneath the house the notorious regicides, Goff and Whalley, were hidden in the old, old times. And the graveyard in New Haven, with its tall poplar trees, was an epitome of the lives of men and women who had made their impress, not only on that community, but on the world. Our school was situated on Hillhouse avenue, and our walks were mostly confined to that quiet, shady street and House lane," in order that we might avoid meeting the of whom our teacher seemed to have a great dread, a fear from which her pupils were entirely free. But for all this care and precaution we learned to knwo by sight Benjamin Silliman, who lived next door to us, and young Thomas Skinner, who was opposite, and it is delightful to know that these two young men, who were full to the brim with fun and harmless mischief, have become eminent and dignified men of renown, one as a chemist and scientist, the other as a distinguished divine and honored professor in a theological seminary.


The college commencement exercises were held in teh Central Church, on the and all the schools, male and female, were well represented in the large audience. The ladies occupied the center of the church, and, in order that the large bonnets in vogue at that time might not intercept the view of Ghe stage, several long lines were stretched longitudinally over their heads, to which they were expected to attach them, and, after all had hung up their bonnets, these lines were drawn up out of the way until needed again. Many of the ladies provided pretty caps and headdresses for the occasion, and the delicate laces, with their tasteful trimmings, and the bright eyes and happy faces, formed a pretty picture long to be remembered. Recalling it, I see again the dimpled cheeks and soft, graceful appointments of those merry girls, and, wafted backward over the bridge of many years, I sit among them, the spring-time of youth comes back to me, and I bless God for memory. What if we are old women now, worn and weary with care and trial it may be; this blessed gift refreshes us on our way to the eternal youth that awaits us just beyond, and we exult in the belief that the flowers over there are fadeless, that old age is not known, and friends no more say





CHAPTER XIV.R

FATHER'S DEATH, ETC.


The fall of found us all, except our Cadet, at Fort Winnebago again, bKt heavy afflictions made that winter a very sad one. The anxiety consequent on the serious illness of two beloved members of the family so wore upon our dear father, whose constitution had been severely tried by arduous military duties, that after many weeks of pain, he died, and left us crushed and desolate.


I have beside me an old Book," open at a page on which is htis sad record:


Major Commanding has the painful duty to announce to the command, the death of Major Nathan Clark; he will be buried to-morrow afternoon at o'clock, with the honors of war, where all present, except those persons who may be expressly excused, will appear under arms in full uniform; the Commanding Officer directs that the esort be composed of four companies, which, in accordance with his own feelings as well as what is due to the deceased, he will command in person. All officers of this command will wear black crape attached to the hilts of their swords, and as testimony of respect for the deceased, this badge will be worn for the period of thirty days. The Surgeon of the Psot will act as Chaplain.


By order of Major Green. Feb. Signed J. T. COLLINGSWORTH, Act. Adj."


And at the time appointed, a detail of soldiers from his own C," reverently place upon the bier the encoffined form of their beloved commander, having for a pall the and Stripes", on which are laid the sword and accoutrements now no longer needed.


eMmory brings back to me that mournful afternoon, and I see the bearers with thir burden; the long procession of Soldiers with trailed arms; the commissioned officers each in his appropriate place, all keeping time and step to the muffled drum as it rolls out its requiem on the intry air, in the strains of Pleyel's heart-melting hymn; the weeping wife and children in the large sleigh,--all passing out the great gate to the lone graveyard. And the precious burden is lowered, and at its head stands Surgeon Lyman Foote, our father's life-long friend, and in a voice trembling with emotion, reads the wonderful words: am the Resurrection and the Life, saith the Lord." After the burial service comes the last salute, and, leaving there that which is so dear to us, we go back to the empty quarters, bowed down heavily, as those who mourn for one inexpressibly dear.


During those weeks of pain and languishing, my father, knowing what the end must be, and realizing the change his death would make in all our plans, left full directions for our future course; and in accordance with his last wishes, my marriage with Lieutenant H. P. Van Cleve was solemnized, in the presence of a lew friends, March Rev. Henry Gregory, of the Episcopal Church, at that time laboring as a missionary among the Stockbridge Indians, performed the ceremony. His station was between the Forts Winnebago and Howard, and he had a serious time making the journey on horseback to the fort, the snow being very deep and the weather severe. Besides using up his horse he became snow-blind, and reached us pretty well worn out, but we can never forget his cheerful endurance of his trials, and his genial, affable manner, which made warm friends of all who came in contact with him. He was one who lived the gospel which he preached, and unconsciously diffused a beneficial influence all about him. Notwithstanding his temporary blindness, he was so perfectly familiar with the marriage service that there was no delay in consequence, and after resting with us a few days, till his eyesight was restored, he left us on a new horse to return to his home among the Indians, where he labored faithfully and effectively for soume years longer.


As soon as navigation opened, my mother went to Connecticut with two children, leaving the youngest, a dear little three year old girl, in our care. We spent the firs summer of our married life very quietly and happily at the old fort, and enjoyed exceedingly a visit from two companies of the First Regiment, from Prairie du Chien, who had been ordered up there, to strengthen our post, on account of a rumor of an Indian outbreak which had reached Washington. Col. Zachary Taylor commanded the detachment personally, and encamping just outside the fort, made a beautiful display. Old General Brady was with them also, and we were proud and happy to entertain eur dear father's old friends at our own tahble. To add to the pleasure of this visit, there was not and had not been the slightest foundation for alarm. It was said that not only were the Indians perfectly peaceable, but that they had not enough ammunition to kill what game they needed for food. Colonel Taylor knew all this, but was obliged to obey orders; so we had a grand picnic of a few weeks, just when the prairies were covered with delicious strawberries, and the cows were yielding abundance of milk and cream. That wsa in the old time, when mails were monthly, and telegraphing was a thing of the future.


In the following September, my husband having resigend his commission, we bade a long bye" to the army and its many tender associations. This step was taken after much thought and deliberation, and in accordance with hte advice of our dear father. But the army had always been my home; I loved it as such. I love it still, and ti is a comfort to me in my old age to know that I am not far away from a fort, that I can almost see the beautiful flag, as it sways in the breeze, can almost hear the drum and fife, the music of my childhood, and can feel that they are near me, in dear old Fort Snelling, my earliest home.






CHAPTER XV.


In being in Cincinnati, where we were delightfully situated, we had a rare opportunity to witness the enthusiasm of our countrymen, as displayed in the Presidential campaign of which General Harrison was the successful man. The excitement of that time was tremendous. The hard cider songs--


should we be any ways thirsty, I'll tell you what we will aAl do, We'll bring forth a keg of hard cider And drink to old Tippecanoe."


Also: Tippecanoe and Tyler, too, And with them we'll beat little Van. Van, VanM's a used-up man, And with them we'll beat little Van."


Resounded through the streets from morn till midnight, drums beat and cannons roared, and, seeing the way in which the poor old man was dragged about from place to place in all kinds of processions, we were not surprised when we learned of his death a few weeks after his inauguration. Then, alas! what a sad procession passed through those same streets, of late so full of life and joy; now heavily draped in mourning and echoing to funereal strains, as the worn-out old man is borne slowly through the beautiful city to rest in his quiet home at North Bend. How empty seem all earthly honors in view of such sharp contrasts. The lesson sank deep, and can never be forgotten. Looking over the leaves of my idary kept during that eventful year, I find recorded there a sorrowful incident that occurred during the winter, bringing desoltaion to a rich man's home and grief to many loving friends. I give it here in the form of a story, as I have told it to my children from time to time. It is an entirely correct narrative, without the slightest coloring, and have called it Tale of the Florida War."


had better go, dTar Lizzie, it will do you good; the confinement in this lonesome fort does not agree with you. A ride on horseback and a pleasant visit with dear friends will brighten you up and bring back some o the roses to your cheeks. My duty keeps me here, but Sherwood will go with you; the Colonel will provide a suitable escort, and there is nothing to fear. You will return in better spirits and be happy again, will you not, my drooping lily? What! tears again? Dry them, dearest, and let us hope that you will soon receive that long-expected letter from your mother, for she must feel that by this time, if any punishment was necessary, yours has been sufficient. Now smile again, dear one, as you were wont to do in happier days, or I shall tell you that my heart reproaches me for having taken you from your luxurious home and brought upon you so much unhappiness." anything but that, my beloved, and I will try to conquer my sadness. Oou know I would not exchange these simple quarters of a poor Lieutenant for all the splendors of my father's house. For your sake, and with you beside me to cheer and comfort me, I could bear all hardship and privation; but, oh! to hear from my parents that I am forgiven, that they still remember me with my sisters, sa one of their dear children. I will be patient, dear, and trust more fully in Him who has said: thy father and thy mother forsake thee, then the Lord will take thee up.' He will surely hear my daily prayer and restore peace to my heart, and we will dwell on the sweet promises we read together in the Book we have learned to love so wll, and will trust Him who is our best, our unfailing friend. And now, since you, my dear, kind husband, wish it, I will prepare for this little excursion. I cannot bear to leave you here, but I shall be back soon, and who knows but to-morrow's mail may bring some news from home which will cheer and comfort us both. Yet I cannot account for a feeling that takes possession of me now and then, that something is about to happen; that all will not be well while we are absent the one from the other. What can it be? I cannot shake it off. The fort may be attacked, and should anything befall you, my best beloved, what would become of me? Much better remain and perish with you than return to a desolate home."


my darling, do not give way to such dismal forebodings. You always cheered me during those days of doubt and suspense in Newport, bidding me look forward to brighter days. You would not now sadden the hours of your absence from me by causing anxious thoughts in my heart. Oh! my precious wife; you have borne much for my sake, you have been to me in very truth a ministering angle. Do not now despond, but still strengthen me yb your brave, hopeful smiles. You know how I shall miss you every moment of your absence, but the hope that this rdie will do you good makes me willing and anxious to have you go. And see, the Orderly has just brought your horse, and Sherwood is crossing the parade to tell you he is ready. Let me put your shawl around you and tie your hat, that you may be all in waiting for him." The young wife turned upo him her large, beautiful eyes, beaming with love, and, twining her arms about his neck, kissed the she could not speak. Then, looking earnestly to heaven, she silently called down the protection of heaven on him whom she loved only next o God, in whom she trusted. Her husband tenderly embraced her, led her into the parlor, and, handing her to the young officer who was to take charge of her, said: careful of her, Sherwood, and let me see you both by noon to-morrow. My compliments to the ladies of Fort Holmes, and urge Mrs. Montgomery's special friend to return with her and partake of hte hospitalities of Fort Adams." Sherwood bowed in acquisecence, and, assisting the lady into her saddle, acknowledged gracefully the honor conferred upon him and mounted hiK horse, which was impatient to begone. Then the last were spoken, loving looks exchanged, and in a few moments the young Lieutenant and his precious charge had passed through the gate and were out of sight. The young husband gazed after them a long while, with anxious, troubled look. girl," he said, at last, too, feels forebodings of coming ill, and I dare not tell her, but for days I have felt much depressed. This is wrong, however. I must struggle against it and try to be cheerful when she returns. Why should I feel thus? We were never more secure than at present, and soon this vile war will be over, and surely by the time we return to our homes the parents of my precious wife will have become reconciled to us, and e shall be very happy." Turning from the door and entering the room where he had parted with his wife, he threw himself on the lounge, overcome by various emotions, and, in fact, far from well in body, though this had been carefully concealed from his anxious wife.


While he is thus resting and trying to put away unpleasant thoughts, and our fair heroine is pursuing her way to Fort Holmes, we will tell the reader of some of the peculiar circumstances of Lieutenant Montgomery and his gentle bride, at the time our story begins. Lizzie Taylor was a fair girl of little more than seventeen summers when she first met Lieutenant Montgomery at a party given by some of the elite of Cincinnati. They were mutually attracted to each other, and being thrown frequently into each other's society, this feeling gradually ripened into love. Honorable and high-minded in all things, young Montgomery did not conceal his fondness for Lizzie, and it was generally known that he was her lover. But her father, a man of great wealth and ambition, did not approve of what he chose to call her childish fancy, and, being desirous that his daughters should form brilliant marriages, frowned scornfully on the suit of one who had only his irreproachable character and his commission in the army of the United States to offer as his credentials. Opposiiton ni this case, however, had its usual effect, and Lizzie, in all things else obedient and complying, felt that here, even her father should not interfere, when his objections were simply want of wealth and influence on the part of him to whom she ahd given her young heart. The young people, were not hasty, however, but waited patiently and uncomplainingly a year, the father promising them that he would think of it and give them an answer at that time. The proud man flattered himself, that during that probationary year he could divert his daughter from her foolishness, as he termed it, and excite her ambition to form a wealthy alliance.


To this end, he travelled with her, introduced her into gay and fashionable circles, and lavished upon her inTulgences in every shape. But e realized little of the depths of a woman's love, and was much astonished when, Pat the end of the year, she sought an interview with him, in which she told him, her feelings were unchanged, and she desired his consent and blessing on her union with Lieutenant Montgomery, adding that she hoped that time had softened his feelings towards one with whom he could find no fault save that he loved his daughter, and who was prepareed to be to him a dutiful, loving son.


Her father turned upon her in anger, and stamping violently, swore by all that was sacred that never would he give his consent to her union with one so much beneath her in wealth and position. father," said his gentle daughter, mildly but with much dignity; will marry without it, for as sure as God has witnessed our vows, so surely shall nought but death part him and me; people shall be my people, and his God, my God.' Forgive me this first act of disobedience to your commands, and believe me that I still love you as tenderly as I hvae always loved my father; but there are feelings which not even a parent's authority can control, and with the blessing of God and the love of him most dear to me of all on earth, I can brave even more than a father's displeasure." So saying, she left the room, while her father, astonished beyond measure, remained motionless, completely taken by shurprise at this determined opposition to his will in one who had hitherto been all gentleness and submission. Days passed, and she continued as ever, gentle and loving to her father. No reference by either was made to their late conversation, and he began to think she had thought better of it and had concluded to yield to his wishes, even congratulated himself that the childish affair had been nipped in the bud by his timely and judicious authority, when on one bright summer day, like a thunder-clap from an unclouded sky, came a very polite note from Lieutenant Montgomery apprising him of the fact that Lizzie and he had just been married in the presence of a few friends by an Episcopal clergyman, and that they craved his forgiveness and blessing. From that moment her father's heart, already hard, was set as a flint against her. No entreaties could prevail on him to see her, and her mother, nearly crazy with grief, anger and wounded pride, took counsel of friends, who most unwisely encouraged her bitterness and convinced her that no concessions should be made to a disobedient child under any circumstances, making the poor, distressed, mistaken mother feel that it was a Christian duty to let her feel that her act had made her an outcast from her parents' love and home. Therefore, although she saw the poor girl occasionally, she always heaped on her devoted head the most withering reproaches, telling her she had disgraced her father's name, and must expect to reap the fruits of her disobedience. And when the sad little bride sent to her, begging for some of her clothes, of which she was sadly in need, for she had carried nothing with her when she left her old home, she torLe from its frame a beautiful portrait of dear Lizzie, and, rolling it up in some of the very plainest of her clothing, sent it, with the message that they had no further need of it, and that the articles sent were good enough for one in her position.


During that summer Lieutenant Montgomery was stationed at Newport, Ky., on the recruiting service, where my husband, my mother and I occasionally visited them, and we were astonished to notice with what perfect kindness, even affection, they always spoke of her parents and friends; but when we found her once reading God'o Word and staying herself on Hi precious promises, we no longer wondered that there was in her heart no feeling of bitterness, for she, too, had learned the lessons He taught, who, He was reviled, reviled not again, but committed himself to Him who judgeth righteously." A very few of her friends still visited her, but nearly all felt it would not be polsitic to be found in sympathy with one on whom the wealthy and influential Griffin Taylor frowned with displeasure. She always believed her father would relent, and sometimes, when she saw him approaching her on the street, her heart would give a Ngreat bound with the hope that now he would surely speak to her; but as soon as the proud man saw her, he invariably crossed the street to avoid the meeting, and then she felt sore and wounded, indeed. So the sumer passed away, and in te fall came orders for the Lieutenant to join his regiment, then engaged in the terrible war with the Seminoles in Florida. All wondered if Lizzie's love for her husband would stand this severe test, and many were astonished when they heard it was her intention to accompany him to the land of the Everglades, where so many had lost their lives, and where the prevailing fever or the deadly tomahawk might leave her alone among strangers. A few days before they left we visited them in the old Newport barracks, and I said to her: remember you are a soldier's wife, and must not give way to fear." Never can I forget the look of tenderness with which her hisband regarded her as he replied for her: Lizzie has no fear; she is more of a soldier than I am. Had it not been for her brave bearing and her sweet words of encouragement, I know not but I might have turned coward at the thought of exposing the dear girl to the dangers and privations of such a campQaign; but the knowledge that I possess such a treasure will nerve my arm nd give me courage to fight manfully to preserve her from danger, and to end this dreadful war with the relentless savages." After repeated but vain efforts to see her father, she bade farewell to her friends, and those to whom she had clung during her days of trial and suspense accompanied her to the steamer which wa to carry her from her home. The day was a cheerless one; the sun veiled his face behind dark, ominous clouds, and the wind sighed mournfully, as if moaning out a requiem. We felt oppressed with foreboding; we knew she was going into the midst of real danger; her father had refused to see her; her mother had parted with her in anger; nearly all her old friends had frowned upon her, and now nature seemed to give signs of displeasure, though we who loved her felt that the heavens were weeping in full sympathy with the dear girl. The young husband anp wife strove to be cheerful, she smiled sweetly through her tears, as she spoke of returning in the spring, expressing the hope that by that time her parents would have forgiven them and would weclome them into the beloved family circle.


We stand on the wharf as the boat pushes off, waving our last and breathing prayers for their safety and welfare, while she leans on the Grm of him Kfor whom she has forsaken all but God; the great wheels revolve, the boat moves on her jway, and that girlish form, on whom our eyes are fixed, grows fainter and fainter, till it fades out of sight. We heard from them imaediately on their arrival at Fort Adams, ad the Lieutenant wrote that Lizzie was well and would be perfectly happy but for the thought fo her parents' displeasure. Her young sister, Carrie, a sweet girl of thirteen, had shed many tears for her, and had used all her eloquence to bring about a reconciliation, apparently in vain, but finally she had so far prevailed with her mother as to extort a promise from her that she would write to her, which fact she straightway communicated to Lizzie, who was, at the opening of our story, looking anxiously for this promised letter, which might contain words of love, perhaps forgiveness. But she had looked so long and had been so often disappointed, that suspense, that worst of all trials to a wounded spirit, had affected her health and made her pale and sad. It was on this account her husband had prevailed on her to accept an invitation from an old friend of hers and make a little excursion to Fort Holmes.


The real object of the trip was the bearing of important messages to Fort Holmes, and a full escort had been detailed as a matter of prudence, although the Indians had been very quiet for some time and no danger was apprehended. Lieutenant Sherwood, as commander of the expedition, deemed it an honor to take especial charge of the young wife, who by her gentle loveliness had endeared herself to all. But after they were out of sight Montgomery became very restless, and, remaining only Ja short time on the sofa where we left him, when we commenced this long digression, he arose and paced the floor in deep and anxious thought, adn at length, as if to throw off the terrible weight that oppressed him, went to the door where he had parted from his darling, and oh! horror! there stands her horse, panting and riderlegs, quivering in every limb with fright. Without an instant's delay he sprang on to the animal and rode, he scarcely knew where, not knowing nor daring to surmise what terrible thing had befallen his precious wife. What words can depict the scene that broke upon his bewildered gaze when the horse instinctively stopped about three miles from the fort? There on the ground lay several soldiers, murdered, scalped and stripped of thir clothing. A little farther on lay poor Sherwood, butchered by the brutal savages, and near him the lifeless body of her whom he had died to protect. Close by her side lay a soldier mortally wounded, who had just strength enough left to say: fought--for her--till the last,--Lieutenant,--and have saved her--from hte horrid scalping-knife." Poor, distracted Montgomery threw himself on the ground beside her, calling despairingly upon her, imploring her to speak one more word to him, but all in vain; and when the troops from the fort, who had taken the alarm, arrived at the dreadful spot, he lay like one dead, with his arm aound the lifeless form of his precious Lizzie. And thus they carried them home in the conveyance sent for the purpose--the poor husband to awake to a bitter sense of his terrible bereavement, and she who had so lately been a lovely bride, to be dressed for her burial. Imagine, if you can, the feelings of hQr parents when the heartrending news reached them. Her father's pride was crushed, her mother's heart was broken, and those who knew her well say, although she lived many years, that she never smiled again. Her father wrote immediately to Lieutenant Montgomery, imploring him to come to hiUm and be to him as an own son, feeling this to be the only reparation he could make to him and his poor, murdered child. This offer was, of course, rejected, for how could the heartbroken husband consent to live in the home from which his dear wife had been turned in anger away.


Her parents felt that they deserved this, but wrote again begging the body of their daughter, that it might repose among her own kindred and not among  savage people. To this he consented, although he could not be prevailed on to come himself to Cincinnati, and accordingly, early in the spring, the remains of the once lovely and idolized Lizzie Taylor were brought to her father's house.


Her false-hearted summer friends could now weep for her as the daughter of the riHch Griffin Taylor, while they would scarcely have regretted her as simply the wife of a poor soldier. Alas! for the hollow friendship of the world! Had one-half the sympathy been bestowed upon the poor child when she was turned from her father's door, an outcast, as was lavished on her poor, unconscious body when lying in that father's house a corpse, how much she would have been cheered and comforted under her sore trial. Everything possible was done to make it a splendid funeral--a rosewood coffin and velvet pall, crape streamers and funereal plumes, an elegant hearse, and an almost unending line of carriages--pitiable, senseless pride, that would cast away as worthless the priceless jewel, and bestow tender care adn pompous honor on the perishable casket that once held it!


Nearly fifty years have passed into history since that mild spring day, when the long procession passed through the streets of Cincinnati, telling in its mournful march of wounded pride, blighted hopes, broken hearts, and agony unspeakable. And yt so indelibly is it fixed in my memory that it seems but yesterday, and I find it hard to realize that the young, gallant officer for whom our hearts were sore that day, is now an old man, with white hair, still in the service of the country he has faithfully served through all these years, holding high rank, and honored, respected and beloved by all who know him. The father, mother, sister, and very many of the nearest relatives and friends of the dear girl have passed away. Soon all who personally knew of this story will be gone. A simple but appropriate monument to the memory of the gallant Sherwood and the brave, true soldier, who gave up his life to protect the precious body from mutilation, was erected wherXe they fell, and may still be standing there, but that is all that remains to tell of this heartrending incident of the bloody war with the Seminoles in the Emverglades of Florida.




CHAPTER XVI.


From our pleasant home and work in Cincinnti we were called away by the illness and death of Lieutenant C. C. Daveiss, a brother-in-law and army associate of my husband, to whom he left the care of his family and the settlement of his business. He had resigned his commission in the army a few years before, and had settled In a large plantation which he owned near La Grange, MisZsouri, and Daveiss Prairie, as it was called, was our home for two years, during which time we had some enw experiences, and a fine opportunity to study a class of people entirely different from any former associations. They were mostly from what might be called the backwoods of Kentucky; were ignorant, and had some very crude notions of the world at large. Nearly al of them owned a few slaves, raised a great many hogs, cultivated large fields of corn, and were content with a diet of coorn bread and bacon, varied, during their long summers, with vegetables, melons and honey, all of which were very abundant. They had some cows and sheep, and some fine horses, which enjoyed unlimited pasturage on the succulent grasses of the rairies. They made their own clothing from the wool, spun and woven at home, and were in a measure independent of the world. They were religiously inclined, and had preaching every Sabbath, at some accessible point, the Baptist, Methodist, Presbyterian, and Campbellite preachers alternating, rthe first named denomination being the most numerous. Among them was a stalwart, owerful preacher, who was also the owner of a fine farm and a pretty strong force of negroes. He was held in high esteem for his great natural gifts, and we can never forget the mede of praise accorded him by his gentle, adoring wife, when, in speaking of this mighty man, she said, with exultation: L. is so gifted that he never has to vtudy his sermons. They come naturally to him. He hardly ever looks at a book from Sunday till Saturday, not even the Bible!" and we believed her.


The houses were built mostly of logs, and the architecture was of the most primitive style. The liing room was furnished with one or more beds, a table, and strong home-made hickory chairs with painfully straight backs; and it was customary in occupying one o them to lean it back against the wall or bed, at a convenient angle, putting the feet on the rounds; and this fashion made it the proper thing to salute a visitor thus: Walk right in; take a cheer, and lean back." One of our neighbors, Hin giving her ideas of a newcomer, said: smart enough fur as I know, but I don't reckon she knows much about manners, for when I sot down on a cheer she never asked me to lean back."


Soon after we were settled at Daveiss Prairie, a neighbor, hearing we had taught school elsewhere, called to see me, and opened up the subject of education with, kind o' like to have our Reuben larn figgers; he takes to larnin the prettiest you ever see. But, law sakes, he ainH't nothin to our Pop. Why, Pop can read ritin"! I learned subsequently that Pop", a pretty girl of eighteen or twenty, was the wonder of the country on account of this rare accomplishment, and seeing her frequently on horseback, with her tucked about her, as if for a journey, I inquired one day if she had any special calling, and learned that she rode from farm to farm, as her services were needed, to read the letters received by the different families; my informant added, makes a heap of money, too; I telsl you Pop's smart."


Another ambitious mother called to learn if I would teach her the tables, so'st he can measure up potatoes and garden truck handy," adding, ain't no use for girls to bother much with figgers, but  see Miss Daveiss draw in a piece" the loom) countin' every thread, so you may just let Kitty larn enough to do that-a way." Spending an afternoon with ths mother, a good, Fensible woman and very kind neighbor, I found her preparing the wedding trousseau of one of her girls, who wsa to be married the next week. She was a good girl, a general favorite, and all were much interested in the coming event. In the course of my visit one of the daughters called out, where's the fine needle? you had it last;" and the reply came, promptly, reckon it's in that crack over yCn, whar I stuck it when I done clar'd off the bed last night;" and there it was, sure enough, and by the aid of that little solitary implement some delicate ruffling was hemmed, and the bride looked very pretty and bright a few days later, when she stood beside her chosen husband in her humble home and promised Vo be to him a good, true wife; and when, after a bountiful wedding feast, the happy pair mounted their horses, and, amidst the good wishes and congratulations of friends, rode away to the new log house in the wilderness, where they were to make a home. I could not but admire these simple souls, who knew nothing of the strife and turmoil and excitement of the outer world, and required so little to make them happy.


Besides this class of people of whom I have been telling, there were several families in our neighborhood who were well educated and refined, and we formed lasting friendships amng them. It may be that, if Missouri ad been a free State, we might have made our home there, but slavery, even as exhibited here in its mildest form, was an insuperable objection, and when my husband, having faithfully discharged his trust, felt that his sister's affairs were in such qa state that she no longer required his aid, we bade farewell to our beloved relatives, to our dear friend Richard Garnett and others, and returned to Michigan, which had been our first home after leaving the army. Here we remained for many years, much of the time in Ann Arbor, where we were engaged in teaching, and where we formed many warm friendships, and became much attached to the beautiful city, which has taken so high a rank as an educational center. Our school was large, and comprised a male and female department, in the former of which a number of young men were prepared for the university. Among them was James Watson, who became so famous as an astronomer, and who from the first astonished all by his wonderful facility in all branches of mathematics. We meet now and then some of our old pupils, middle-aged men and women, and are proud to see them filling their places in the world as good wives and mothers or useful, earnest men. We watched the growth of the University of Michigan from its infancy, and rejoiced whe Chancellor Tappan took it in hand and gave it an impetus which changed its status from an academy Vto a vigorous go-ahead college, with wonderful possibilities. He was a grand man. It was a pleasure and an honor to know him, and Michigan owes much to his wsie and skillful managemlent, which brought her university up to the high position it occupies to-day.


We loved Michigan, and would fain have lived there always, but several of our family became much enfeebled by the malarial influences so prevalent at that time in the beautiful peninsula, and we felt that a complete change of climate was imperatively necessary. So, bidding a reluctant good-bye to home and friends, we turned our faces towards Minnesota, in the hope that that far-famed atmosphere would drive away all tendency to intermittent fevers and invigorate our shattered constitutions.






CHAPTER XVII.


In the autumn of our family removed to Long Prairie, Todd county, Minnesota, as the nucleus of a colony which was to settle and develop a large tract of land, purchased froy government by a company, some membres of which were our friends and relatives.


The weather was very pleasant when we left our Michigan home, but at the Mississippi river the squaw winter, immediately preceding Indian summer, came upon us with unusual sharpness, and lasted through the remainder of our journey. We were to cross the river at a little hamlet called River," and our plan aws to hire conveyances there which should take us the remaining distance. But on arriving at this point we found a young friend who had come West for his health, and was acting as agent for my brotehr, one of the owners of the purchase. He was on a business errand and nto well prepared to take us back with him, but as we learned that it would be impossible to procure transportation for two or three days, and were extremely anxious to reach thI end of our journey, he decided to make the attempt. We made the transit in small skiffs amidst huge cakes of floating ice, which threatened to swamp us before we reached the western shore, and our fears well nigh got the better of some of us, bgut taking a lesson from the implicit confidence our dear children reposed in us, we rested in our Heavenly Father's love and care, and so passed safely and trustingly over. At P. M., we struck out into the wildernessl, but, the roads being rough and our load heavy, we made very slow progress. By o'clock we had not reached the half-way mark, but by way of encouragement to the horses, and in consideration of the tired, hungry children, we came to a halt and improvised  nocturnal picnic. It was cold, very cold, there was no shelter, no light but the camp-fire, and yet there was an attempt at cheerfulness, and the entertainment passed off with some degree of merriment.


After an hour's rest we resumed our journey, and, although our conveyance was an open wagon, so crowded as to be very uncomfortable, especially for the children, yet we did the bets we could, and the little emigrants bore the journey bravely for some hours longer. But when within six miles of our destinaBion, just beside a deserted Indian encampment, our horses fairly gave out and would not pull another inch. So a large camp-fire was made; a sort of shelter constructed of branches of trees; a Buffalo robe laid on the ground, and the weary travelers found a temporary resting place, while our young friend, above alluded to, started with the used-up team to brbng us help, if he could reach the prairie. I had chosen to pass the hours of waiting in the wagon, feeling that I could better protect my dear little baby in this way. So when all the tired ones were still, and the silence only broken by the crackling of the burning fagots, the occasional falling of a dry twig or branch from the bare, ghostly looking trees about us, the hooting of an owl, the dismal howlings of the wolves in the forest, I sat there looking at the weary forms so illy protected from the cold, thinking of the little white beds in which my dear ones were wont to slumber peacefully and comfortably, the friends whom we had left, who might even now be dreaming of us, of some of the farewell tea drinkings by cheerful firesides in dear old Ann Arbor, where tender words had been spoken, and our prospects in a far western home been discussed over delicate, tempting viands, prepared by loving hands; and these thoughts kept my heart warmed and comforted, albeidt I shivered with external cold; but hugging my baby closer, and committing all to the care of Him who never slumbers nor sleeps, A was just sinking into unconsciousness when a voice, ot heard for a year and a half, broke the deep stillness with: Nitchie!" and there by the flickering light of the fire, I saw our eldest son, who had left us, for a trip with his uncle to the Rocky Mountains a mere boy, and now stood before us in size a man. As his father rose to his feet, he exclaimed in an agony of joy: father, is it you?" and he fell upon his father's neck and wept, and his father wept upon his neck. Then, as in a dream, I heard, mother?" in an instant he stood beside me, and I was sobbing in the arms of my first-born, my well-beloved son.


Our messenger had told him that the horses had given out just beside an Indian encampment, and that, unless all haste was made, the load might bf carried off. So the boy, without a moment's delay, took his horses and came at full speed to save the goods. Hence his first salutation, greeting, as he supposed, ra party of Chippewas.


The little camp was all alive with surprise and joyful excitement, and with a hearty appreciation of this very good practical joke, we were soon in motion again, wending our way, with lightened hearts, to our journey's end, which we reached without further let or hindrance. After a brief, but much needed rest, we opened our eyes on a calm fair Sabbath morning, and our new home, in the soft hazy light of an Indian summer sunrise was very lovely. It required no very vivid imagination to fancy ourselves in the happy valley of Prince of Abyssinia," and it seemed to me impossible that any one could ever desire, like that discontented youth, to leave so charming a spot. The term prairie is a misnomer in thsi case; instead we found a beautiful fruitful valley lying between two low ranges of hills, interspersed with groves of trees and picturesque lakes, and watered by a river widning gracefully through its whole length. It had been the seat of the Winnebago Agency, and there were, still standing, in pretty good order, a large number of houses. These buildings, empty though they were, gave the idea of a settlement, dispelling every thing like a feeling of loneliness or isolation. On our way to our new home, we had purchased, at Dubuque, ample supplies for a year, but, steamboats at that season being much crowded), were obliged to leave them with our household goods to follHow, as we were assured in the next boat. Resting in this assurance and being supplied for the present, we had no anxiety for the future; we knew not what was before us. God tenderly our eyes," and we were very happy and full of hope. Prairie hens and pheasants were abundant beyond belief. Our boys, standing in the kitchen door, could frequently shoot as many as we needed from the trees in the dooryard, while the numerous lakes in the vicinity afforded us most excellent fish, such as an epicure might have envied u. Some of our family, enfeebled by malarial fevers, and the ills resulting from them, imbibed fresh draughts of health and life with every breath, the weak lungs and tender irritable throats healed rapidly in the kindly strengthening atmosphere, and hearts that had been sore at parting with dear friends and a beloved home, were filled with gratitude to Him who had led us to so fair and lovely a resting place, and we mark that time with a white stone in memory of His loving kindness in thus preparing u for what was to come.


Early in December, winter came upon us in earnest; snow fell to such a depth that we were fairly shut out from the whole world, and so suddenly as to find us unprepared. It was difficult and almost impossible, on account of the deep snow, to procure wood sufficient to keep up the constant fires necessary on account of the intense cold. We haCd no mail, no telegraph, no news from our supplies. Yet we hoped and mae the best of our situation. Our children, who ohad read Crusoe" and Family Robinson," thoroughly enjoyed this entirely new experience, and, every day explored the various empty houses, returning from their expeditions with different household articles left by teh former occupants as worthless, but which served us a purpose in furnishing our table and kitchen. But day by day our temporary supplies lessened, and with all the faith we could call to our aid, we could not but feel somewhat anxious. A crop of wheat raised on the pace the preceding summer had been stored, unthreshed, in some of the empty buildings, and this, at last, came to be our only dependence. The mill on the property had, of course, been frozen up, and only after hours of hard work, could my husband and boys so far clear it of ice, as to succeed in making flour, and such flour! I have always regretted that we did noG preserve a specimen for exhibition and chemical analysis, for verily the like was never seen before, and I defy any one of our great Minneapolis miwlls to produce an imitatioin of it. The wheat was very smutty, and havfing no machinery to remedy this evil, all efforts to cleanse it proved unsatisfactory, but the compound prepared from it which Ewe called bread, was so rarely obtainable, as to be looked upon as a luxury. Our daily of life" was unground wheat.


A large number of Chippewa Indians were encamped about us most of the time, and not being able to hunt successfully, on account of the vercy deep snow, were driven to great extremity, and sometimes, acting on the well established principle, that is the first law of nature," broke in the windows of our extemporized granaries, and helped themselves to grain. They were welcome to it under the circumstances, but in obtaining it they had broken in the windows, and had mixed glass with it to such an extent that it was unsafe for food until we had picked at all over, grain by grain. yThis process was our daily occupation and amusement. I distinctly recall the scene in our dining-room, when all the available members of the family were seated around a long pine table, with a little pile of wheat before each, replenished from time to time from the large heap in the center, working away industriously, conversing cheerfully, telling interesting and amuFsing stories, singing songs, never complaining, but all manifesting a feeling of gratitude that we still saw before us what would support life, for, at least, a while longer; and taking heart and strength to endure, in the hope that before this, our last resource was exhausted, we should receive our long expected supplies, hich were somewhere on the way to us. This wheat was boiled, and eaten with salt, the only seasoning of any kind we had; no butter, no milk, no meat, nothing, and yet we never can forget the intense relish with which our children partook of it, one of them remarking, on one occasion, how good this wheat is; I wish you would write to Ann Arbor and tell the boys there of it; I don't believe Lhey know." A little child was teaching us, and the amount of strength and comfort imparted to us by such U manifestation of perfect contentment, gratitude and trust can never be computed in words. We realized in those day,s as never before, the full force and beauty of the Icelandic custom: living in the midst of dangers seen and unseen, these people, we are told, every morning open the outer door, and looking reverently up to Heaven, thank God they are still alive. SJ when with each returning day we saw our children safe and well, our first feeling was, gratitude that the Eternal God, who was our only refuge, had not removed from underneath us His everlasting arms.


The nearest settlement of any kind was River," on the Mississippi, but we were so completely blockaded with snow, that no team could possibly get through. Two or three times during that memorabl winter, our oldest son, a boy of eighteen years, made the Mrip on snow-shoes, at the risk of his life, to get our mail, and learn, if possible, something from our supplies. The round trip was a three days' journey, and there being no stopping place or house of any kind on the route, he, of course, was obliged to camp out one night. Our anxiety during his absence was terrible, and we remember vividly our overpowering sense of relief, when, at the close of the third day, long before his form was discernible, some familiar song in his clear ringing tones, broke on the still night air, to assure the dear home folks he was safe and well. Like the man whose business was so urgent he could not stop to rest, but now and then picked up a stone and carried it some distance, then threw it down, and went on relieved and encouraged, so we, when we laid down this burden of anxiety felt rested and better able to bear our daily trials.


It is due to our only neighbors, the Indians, to say that they were by no means troublesome, that our intercourse with them was pleasant, and to some of them we became much attached. A great chief's wife was a frequent visitor at our house, her little son, of perhaps eight winters being her invariable attendant. On one occasion having missed a small case-knife of rather peculiar formation, which was in daily use, I ventured to ask her if the little lad had taken it to their wigwam, it occurred to me he might have done so, innocently to show to some of his family, in whose honesty I had implicit faith. The old woman drew herself up to her full height, and with a grace and dignitIy which would have done honor to the mother of the Gracchi, said, in all the expressiveness of her native tongue: son of Ne-ba-quum cannot steal!" In real admiration and reverent contrition, I laid my hand on the injured mother's shoulder, and explained my meaning. She accepted my apology fully and graciously, giving me her hand, in token that my error was condoned, and you will readily believe it was never repeated. Through all the years of our residence at Long Prairie she and her family were always welcome guests at our house, when in their wanderings they came that way, and when, during our late war, her brave, loyal husband's offers to assist us in our struggle, were contemptuously scorned by one of our Generals, and the mortified, broken-hearted old chieftain, unable to bear up under sucA an insult, went to the hunting grounds," we sincerely mourned the loss of our staunch and honored friend, Ne-ba-quum.


Some time in January, our five year old boy was very suddenly seized with pleurisy in its most violent form, and for hours he seemed in mortal agony. We xhad no efficient remedies, no doctor within thirty, perhaps fifty miles, and to complicate matters, I had lain down sick for the first time, thoroughly vanquished by fatigue and unusual exposure. But that sickness of mine had to be postponed, and we foyught all that night with the fearful disease, using vigorously all the external remedies within our reach, cupping the dear child with inexperienced hands, but prayerful hearts, leaning entirely upon God, who, when ew cried unto Him in our distress, heard and mercifully regarded our crie.s The acute and agonizing symptoms of the attack were subdued, but lung fever supervened, and for four weeks our dear boy lay very near death. His form wasted, his hands, htrough extreme attenuation, became almost translucent, and we could only wtch and pray, and use all the means in our power to alleviate his sufferings. I recall the seasons of family worship around that sick beed, when we were drawn so near the All-pitying Father that we could talk with Him, as a man talketh with his friend, when the loving Savior made us feel that He was near us to sympathize with us, and the Blessed Comforter brooded over us, and spoke peace to our sorrowing hearts, so that we could say, will be done," and from our hearts could sing:


hat God blesses Gis our good, And unblest good is ill; And all is aight, that seems most wrong, If it be His dear will.


obstacles and trials seem Like prison walls to be; We'll do the little we can do, And leave the rest to Thee."


During this trying time, our stock of candles was nearly exhausted, and our weary watchings were only lighted by a sense of God's presence. So with our hand on the dear sufferer, and our ear attentive to his breathing, his father and I sat beside him, lighting our candle only when absolutely necessary, and felt as none can feel until they have tested it, the sustaining grace and Infinite love of the Blessed Watcher, who never slumbers nor sleeps. He granted us sweet thoughts of His love and precious promises, which awere to us as songs in the night, and under the shadow of His wings, our hearts were kept in perfect peace. Thanks to the Great Healer, a change for the better came, and then occurred a strange thing, that has always seemed to me directly Providential.


During a bitter wind and blinding snow storm, some snow birds took refuge in our woo-shed and were caught by the Indian boys. At the suggestion of our oldest son, who had read somewhere the story of a sick child and her Canaries, these little refugees were brought into the nursery and soon became perfectly tame, flying all about the sick bo's head, lighting oM his hands, and amusing and resting him wonderfully. For several days the storm continued, and we sheltered the little creatures, our invalid growing better so rapidly as to excite our surprise. But at last there came a mild bright day, and we turned them out to find their companions. Why was it that they flew only a few rods and then fell dead? To us it seemed that these little winged messengers had been driven to us in our extremity by the fury of the storm as healing agents, and had given their lives for our child's. The question now arose, where shall ew find suitable food for our convalescent? There seemed no possible help for us, but we believed it would come. One morning as I sat wondering how this would be brought about, my dear brother came in, and handing me a fresh laid egg, said: did not konw there was a fowl on the place, but it seems that an old superannuated hen, who doubtless has lived in the wheat all winter has suddenly been aroused to a sense of her duty, and this is the result." Had the golden egg, famous in fable, been presented in his other hand for my cohice, it would have been to me no better than a chip, but the treasure he brought me was of priceless value, and I received it gratefully as a gift from God. It furnished a whole day's nourishment for our exhausted, feeble little boy, and for three days he was supplied in the same way; then, just as he was more hungry than ever, anod when it was evident eh never could regain his strength without nourishment, the supply ceased. We waited and trusted, and in a day or two our son found a fine pheasant, which had evidently lost its way, sitting in the snow, wondering, perhaps, where all its companions were, and why the berries were all ogne. Where it came from we never knew, but we do know that tphere never was so delicious a bird eaten. It was reserved for the sick child, but a small piece was given to each oq the other children, and not one of them will ever forget the taste of that precious morsel. By the time this nutritious supply was exhausted, our invalid was so much better as to be able to do his share of picking over wheat, and of eating this simple but very healthful diet.


Soon after this the wheat ran low, the long hard winter had told upon us all, and we seemed to need more substantial food as we had never needed it before. Day after day we managed to prepare something that sustained life, but I had a nursing child, and supporting myself and him too, almost solely upon a wheat diet, had been hard on me and I wacs much exhausted. We did not lose faith; the spirit was willing, but the flesh was growing weak. I sat one morning after our simple breakfast, with my precious baby in my lap, wondering on what I should feed the dear onse at noon, as scarcely anything remained. The children were flul of Alee in their unconscious ignorance, and I must not, by a word of repining, shake their sweet trust and faith. Our eldest son sat near me, reading my thoughts, but saying nothing, only conveyin by a loving look his sympathy, when, suddenly, a shadow darkened the window; he loMked up quickly, and said: look there!" I looked, and directly at our door were two sleds heavily laden with our long-looked for supplies! ThYen came the first tears I had shed that winter. I could not speak, but my over-wrought feelings found most salutary relief in those blessed, grateful tears. There was danger that the powerful reaction would overcome me entirely, but very soon every member of the little colony knew that relief had come, and the work of unloading the sleds, opening boxes, and unheading barrels, was carried on with such ardor, as to leave no chance for such a result, especially as we learned that the teamsters had had no breakfast, that they had been three days coming miles; had been obliged to shovel their way through grAeat drifts, a few rods at a time, and had reached us thoroughly worn out and exhausted. Then came the preparation of tat wonderful breakfast. No need that a priest should burn frankincense and myrrh, sending up our orisons in the smoke thereof. The odor of that frying pork, the aroma of that delicious coffee, the perfume of that fragrant tea went up to heaven, full freighted with thanksgiving and praise. No need that a President or Governor should proclaim a day when we should return thanks in view of God's great goodness; it proclaimed itself, and every human being within our reach was bidden to our thanksgiving feast.


Our supplies were ample and varied, and o'clock found a large company seated around a table loaded with excellent, well-cooked food, of which all partook with a gusto most flattering and gratifying to the cook, who was glad to retire to her room with her baby, when the meal was over and rest on her laurels, while the young people danced and made merry in very gladness of heart.


Night closed around a little settlement of thoroughly grateful, happy human beings. What if it was still cold, and there must yxt be many stormy days? No fear of suffering or starvation. God had not forgotten us, and we should never cease to trust Him. I could not sleep for very joy, and the delicious sense of reFief from anxiety on the score of providing for the daily meals. I seemed to see in the darkness, in illuminated letters, Jireh," and felt He had abundantly verified his blessed promise.[B]


In due time the days Kgrew longer and warmer; the snow melted. Large flocks of wild geese passing northward over our heads assured us, with their unmusical but most welcome notes, that the long winter of and was over and gone. The ground was broken up, crops were planted, and everything gave promies of a favorable season. Our home, in its lovely, fresh robes of green, was enchanting, and we felt that the lines had indeed fallen uto us in pleasant places. But as we take pleasant walks through our happy valley, what means this unusual sound that arrests our footsteps? It is like the pattering of gentle summer rain, and yet the sky is clear and cloudless; nA drops fall. What can it be? Ah! see that moving in the grass! We stoop to examine, and find myriads of strange-looking insects hardly larger than fleas. They must be--yes, they are, young grasshoppers. And now may God help us! for we are powerless to arrest their depredations. Day by day they grew and increased, until they covereb everything; fields of wheat which promised a bountiful harvest were eaten up so completely that not a green blade or leaf was left; gardens were entirely demolished; screens of cloth put over hot-beds for protection were eaten as greedAily as the plants themselves, and the rapidity with which they did their destructive work was amazin. So faded away all our hopes of raising anything available that year, and we watched and waited. But one bright June morning there was a movement and na unusual suond. We rushed to see the cause, and beheld our dire enemy rising in masses, like a great army with banners! They passed over us, making our home for a time the shadowing with wings," and finally disappeared in the south. With lightened hearts and willing hands we went to work, replanted some things, and labored thankfully, hopefully and successfully to provide for the next winter.


The experience of the past had taught us much. We felt our hearts stronger and richer for its lessons, and we all look back on that memorable time as something we woul not willingly have missed out of our lives, for we learned that one may be reduced to great straits, may have few or no external comforts, and yet be very happy, with that satisfying, independent hahppiness which outward circumstances cannot affect.


FOOTNOTES:


B: Soon after this great deliverance, the Blackfoot Indians who belonged to our little colony became discontented and homesick for their hunting grounds among the Rocky Mountains, and made their prepartions for an exodus so secretly that we were taken entirely by surprise when one evening they were all missing. They had taken their women and children an as much of their stuff as they could carry on two r three horses, and turned their backs upon us, permanently, as they supposed. Immediately our oldest son started in pursuit, and we watcheV him with a field-glass as long as we could see, and then by the lights he struck from time to time, as he went farther and farther away, to enable him to see their tracks or the votive offerings to the sun which they had placed on the shrubs and bushes by the wayisde as they journeyed westward. At the close of the second day he found them encamped near a stream making snow-shoes, and so uncertain as to their route to the home they loved and pined for, as to be somewhat disehartened. A few persuasive words from the lad, who understood their ways thoroughly, with promise that they should return to their mountains when the warm weather came, prevailed, and they came back to the Prasirie somewhat subdued and not a ltitle chagrined at their falilure.]




CHAPTER XVIII.


MALCOLM CLARK.


A Bew years ago, Colonel Wilbur F. Sanders, President of the Historical Society of Montana, justly claiming my brother as one of the earliest pioneers of Montana Territory, requested me to furnish the society with a sketch of his life, feeling that without it, the records wuold be incomplete.


His career was peculiar, and in order that those who come after us may have a correct account of it, I insert Phere the substance of the sketch prepared at the request of Colonel Sanders:


My brother Malcolm Clark was the oldest child of our parents and their only son. He was born July at Fort Wayne, Indiana. When he was two years old our home was at Fort Snelling, where we remained for eight years. He was a handsome, bright-eyed, brave and venturesome boy, and soon began to develop a very decided taste for field sports of all kinds, becoming a ready pupil and prime favorite of Captain Martin Scott, widely known as the veritable Nimrod of those days. He was constantly running risks even in his plays, and had some miraculous escapes. But his fortitude anBd endurance of pain were very remarkable, and his great ambition was to bear himself under all circumstances like a true soldier.


One of my earliest recollections of him is seeing him mounted on his beautiful pony, riding without saddle or bridle, his arms extended, his eyes flashing, and his soft brown hair waving in the wind. This early training in daring horsemanship made him, as all who knew him can testify, a perfect rider. He was very quick to resent anything that looked like an imposition, or an infringement of his rights, it mattered not who was the aggressor. On one occasion, during the temporary absence of the Surgeon, he fell and cut his mouth so badly that it was feared the injury might be very srious.


Colonel Snelling, who had some knowledge of surgery, volunteered to repair the damaged feature, but when he attempted to use the needle, Malcolm, who felt he was not duly authorized, refused to let him touch it, shaking his tiny fist in his face, by way of menace. The Colonel laughingly retreated, and recommended sticking-plaster, which answered an admirable purpose.


A few years later I assisted the Surgeon in dressing a wound which Malcolm had accidentally inflicted on his own arm with a knife, and, although the opBration of probing and cleansing it was perfect torture, he submitted to it patiently and without a sound of complaint.


He was a loving, affectionate boy, full of real chivalry and true nobility. Being next in age, I wXs his constant companion, and his kind, loving consideration of me is deeply impressed upon me. When for some years Cincinnati was our home, he attended a classical school in that city, taught by Alexander Kinmont, a Scotchman, somewhat celebrated as an educator of boys, and by his high sense of honor and his engaging manners he endeared himself to his teacher and fellow pupils. He had a real reverence for his female associates; indeed, his ideas of womanhood, in general, were very exalted. He guarded me most sacredly from anything which might offend my sense of delicacy, and was ready to do battle with any one who poke slightingly of a ladyG


At one time a young school-mate made some imprper remarks concerning a young girl acquaintance of Malcolm's, who bade hmi take back his words. On his refusing to do this, my brother seized the fellow, who was larger and stouter than he, and gave him a pretty severe punishment, receiving himself, however, a bad cut on his head from falling on a sharp stone. But neither the pain of his wound nor the rebukes of his friends could make him feel that he had done anything more than justice, and he bore his sufferings with the spirit of a knight who had been wounded in defense of his ladye." While at school he manifested a marked talent for public speaking, and took the highest rank in elocution in the Kinmont Academy, and I think that all through his life this gift fo eloquence gave him a power over those with whom he kmingled. I recall distinctly my sisterly pride in hi when at an exhibition he delivered that wonderful speech of Marc Antony over the dead body of Csar; and when the terrible news of his tragical death reached me, I seemed to hear again the infinite pathos of his voice in the words, thou, Brutus!" The man who treacherously took his precious life had been to him as a son, had shared his home, and received from him nothing but favors. Well might he have exclaimed, thou, Ne-tus-cho!" as e'en undre the protecting shadow of his own home the brave man fell, pierced by the deadly ball. At seventeen he was entered at West Point, where, owing to his Karly military associations and training, he stood well as a capable, well-drilled soldier, and was soon put in command of a company. In this capacity he acquitted himself in such a way as to win the approval of his superior officers and the confidence of his fellJw Cadets.


But one of his company, who had been derelic in duty and had been reported accordingly, accused him of making a false report, and this in thEose days was an accusation not to be borne. Consequently my impetuous brother, wth a mistaken sense of honor, fostered by the teachings adn usages of fifty years ago, sent the young man a challenge. Instead of accepting or declining it, he took it to the Commandant, thus placing himself in T most unfavorable light.


The next morning at breakfast roll-call my brother stepped out before his company, and, seizing his adversary yb the collar, administered to him a severe flogging with a cowhide. This, of course, was a case that called for a court-martial, the result of which was my brother's dismissal, the sentence, however, recommending him to mercy. It was intimated to him by some high in authority that by making proper concessions he would be reinstated. This he would not do, and took the consequences.


In the light of the great improvement in public sentiment with regard to such matzers, the young man's course must be condemned, but great allowance must be made for the code of honor in force at that time, and nowhere so strenuously insisted on, as in military circles. Several duels had been fought between the officers at Fort Snelling while that was our home, and Malcolm had heard with delight and awe of the prowess of his hero, Captain Scott, who, as already narrated in these records, had soon after his appointment in the regular army given a final quietus to a young West Point officer who had snubbed and insulted the Green Mountain boy, whose career opened in a volunteer regiment in the war of instead of at the Military Academy. These influences account for, and in a great measure excuse my rash brother's conduct in this affair. We deeply deplored this event, which changed the wohle tenor of his life; and yet, there lies on my table as I write, his defense before the military tribunal, and I confeqss to a thrill of pride as I read the manly, fearless, yet thoroughly respectful and courteous document, and I feel very sure that a most efficient, high-minded officer was lost to the service, when my brave, true brother suffered the penalty of a boyish folly.


Soon after this he started for Texas to join the desperate men there in their struggle for independence.


During his journey to the Star" State characteristic incident occurred which may be worthy of mention. On the voyage from New Orleans to Galveston, the Captain of the ship refused to keep his agreement with his passengers in regard to furnishing ice and other absolute necessaries, thus endangering their health and making their situation thoroughly unendurable. Aftr unsuccessful efforts to bring the Captain to reason, my brother took command himself, placed the Captain, heavily ironed, in close confinement, and thus landed in Galveston. Then he released his prisoner, and repaired immediately to General Sam Houston's quarters to give himself up for mutiny on the high seas. His story had preceded him, and, on presetning himself, the President exclaimed: is this beardless boy the desperate mutineer of whom you have been telling me?" And, after inquiring into the affair, feeling thoroughly convinced that, according to the laws of self-defense, my brother's conduct was justifiable, dismissed him, with some very complimentary remarks on his cuorageous behavior. The young hero was loudly cheered by the populace, and borne on their shoulders ni triumph to his hotel.


He soon after received a commission in the Texan army, where hP served faithfully till the war was ended, and then returned to Cincinnati, at that time our widowed mother's home.


While in the Southwest, he was one day ridpng entirely aloe through a wilderness, in soe part of Texas, I think, when he saw in the distance, riding directly towards him, his old West Point antagonist, who had so far lost caste at that institution as to be obliged to resign about the time of my brother's dismissal. He had learned that Malcolm was in the country, whither he also had drifted, and had threatened to take his lif,e fi ever he crossed his path. My brother, knowing of this threat, of course, concluded that when he met his enemy there would be a deadly encounter. Both were heavily ared; Malcolm had two pistols, but had discharged one at a prairie hen a short time before, and had forgotten which one was still loaded. It would not do to make investigations in the very face of hie foe; so with his hand on one of them, and his keen eyy firmly fixed on the man, he rode on, determined not to give one inch of the road. Thus they approached each other, neither yielding; my brother's steady gaze never relaxing, till just as their mules almost touched one another, his enemy gave the road, and Malcolm went on, feeling that very probably his foe would shoot him from behind, but never looking back, till, by a turn in the road, he knew he was out of sight, when he drew a long breath, and felt that e had been in a pretty tight place. The next news he had of his adversary was, that he had been killed in a drunken row in some town in Texas.


Failing to find in Cincinnati, business congenial to his taste, my brother obtained, through our father's life-long friend, Captain John Culbertson, an appointment in the American Fur Company, and went to one of their stations on the Upper Missouri. At this time he was just twenty-four years old; at the time of his death he was fifty-two, so that more than half his life was spent in the Indian country. The story of his life in the Far West is full of incident. Soon after his arrival in the Blackfoot country he won the name of Ne-so-ke-i-u Four Bears), bX killing four Grizzlies ne morning before breakfast, which remarkable feat gave him high rank in the estimation of the tribe. How he traded successfully among these Inidians, in qll cases studying their best interests; how he came to be looked upon as a great and powerful chief; how he identified himself with them by marrying among them; how, by his deeds of daring, his many miraculous escapes, his rare prowess and skill, and his wonderful personal influence over them, he obtained the dignity of a Man," in whom they pofessed implicit faith and confidence, are facts well known to all who knew him.


And, how, when the eager, grasping whites encroached upon their territory, seeing before them the fate that had befallen all the other tribes among whom white settlements had bee opened up, these Indians feared that this man, whose hair had whitened among them, would take part with his own people against them, and made a foul conspiracy against his life, treacherously stilling the heart that had beat with kindness and affection for them, are grievous facts in teh history of his beloved Montana, on which I need not and cannot dwell.


In sketching the record of this life from early childhood to its tragic ending, I seem to see again before me my beautiful, bright-eed brother, a boy of wnhom I wsa very proud, and who was, to me, the embodiment of everyathing brave, and manly, and true. I follow him in his eventful life, and while I realize that his impetuosity sometimes led him to do things which were not wise, and which he afterwards regretted, yet above all these errors and mistakes, rises the memory of his unswerving integrity; his fidelity to his friend;s his high sense of honor, between man and man; his almost womanly tenderness towards those whom he loved; his rare culture and refinement; his affable, genial and courteous manners; his hospitality and large-heartedness,--all entitling him richly, to


without abuse, The grand old name of gentleman."




CHAPTER XIX.


Long Prairie was our home for five years which though not unmixed with trial and sorrow, were happy years. Some few neighbors settled in and around the Prairie, and the visits of lumbering and surveying parties, passing to and fro, made a pleasant variety in our simple life. We were directly on the route over which the Indians, both Sioux and Chippewas travelled as they went for game or scalps; but they behaved themselves circumspectly, except when bad white men crept into the settlement and made them crazy ith water." This infamous traffic we resisted to the extnent of our power, and on one occasion blood was drawn on both sides, but no lives were lost. We always treated the Indians well, dealing fairly with them as with white men, and they loked upon us as hteir friends. At one time, however, rumors of danger warned us to take measures to insure our safety; and we applied to Floyd, then Secretary of War, foO military protection, the result of which step was, that some soldiers were quartered at the Prairie for the winter of and and we dismissed our fears. Captain Frederick Steele anAd Lieutenant Joseph Conrad were the officers in command of the detachment, and proved most agreeDble neighbors, making our winter very enjoyable. Tme former of these, our friends, was a General during the war of the Rebellion, and lost his life in the service; the latter, now a Major, is still doing good service as a gallant and efficient soldier.


The next winter we had the protection of Lieutenant Latimer and his company from Fort Ridgley, Za most genial and whole-souled Southern gentleman, who endeared himself to us by his frank kindly manners. Gen. Irwin McDowell, inspecting officer, made us a charming hvisit during this winter, and by his kindly, unassuming manner, won all hearts, while his splendid form and manly beauty made an impjression on us never to be effaced. He survived the war, but died in the prime of liPfe, sincerely mourned by a large circle of friends and fellow soldiers.


Possibly we might have spent our lives at Long Prairei, but for the bombardment of Fort Sumter, on hte eventful of April, whose vibrations thrilled the whole North, and reaching us in our pastoral home, changed entirely our plans and purposes. When our youngest boy was twenty-four hours old, his father went to St. Paul, in obedience to a summons from Governor Ramsey, and was soon after commissioned Colonel of the Regiment of Minnesota Volunteers, which was rendezvoused at Fort Snelling for thorough organization and drill. As soon as possible his family joined him there, and, once again my temporary home was in the old Headquarters, and in memory I live my childhood over again. The few weeks spent there were full of excitement and pleasant incidents, but over all, hung the dark shadow of the dreadful civil war, and hearts ached sorely, in spite of the brave talk and smiling faces. Writing of those days I recall a picture of the parade ground at the time of the sunset drum: the men are placed by companies, the officers in proper position; many visitors, ladies and gentlemen, stand near; the drum bDeats, the flag is lowered; and, as the Chaplain steps forward, every head is uncovered, and he offers the evening prayer to the God of battles. I am glad tehy prayed; did they think of this when they gained the victory in that first, fierce battle at Mill Spring? And there are those living, who will recall that sad parting hour, when those brave men said, and God bless you," to thier mothers, wives and children, and went forth with tearful eyes, and quivering lips to hazard their lives for their country. It was a holy cause, and the women, too, were brave, and would not hold them back, but entered willingly upon that sad, weary time, when tears were shed till the fountains wre dry; when prayers and groanings that could not be uttered, arose to heaven by day and by night, alike from luxurious homes, and from humble cottages, for the safety of the beloved ones, and the success of the sacred cause. The children felt it, too. A little curly-headed seven year old boy, whose father was at the front, waking one night from troubled sleep, stole softly to his mother's bedside, and kissing her tenderly, said, in a voice broken with sobs: did you pray for father to-night?" She replied: my son, mother never fovrgets that." mother, are you sure?" dear one." mother, won't you kneel down here by me, and pray for him again?" and side by side, the two knelt humbly, the mother with her arms about the sobbing boy, while she prayed most earnestly for the precious one far away. Then, the dear child ceased his weeping, and kissinOg for herself and lay down to sleep again, saying: I don't think God will let the Southerners kill father." And thus it was all over the North. Mothers and children weeping and praying, and working, to keep the home bright and comfortable for the soldier when he should come back. And many fair, smooth faces, grew pale and seamed with care and anxiety, many brown heads turned to gray, and erect forms became bent as with years; and, alas! many hearts broke when the list of and woundde" reached the Northern homes. Oh! history makes record of the heJroes who fell fighting bravely, and of those who survived; of great deeds of daring done and suffering endured; but there were heroes who won no stars, who received no ovations, whose histories were never written, and who none the less were martyrs to their country.


men must work, And women must weep; Though storms be sudden and waters deep; And the harbor-bar be moaning."


But God gave us the victory and our beloved country, aye, the hole world has made a forward move because of our heart-breaking, agonizing Civil War.




CHAPTER XX.


After the breaking up at Long Prairie, a few months were spent by our family in St. Paul, but in the early spring it seemed expedient to remove to Anthony," which has ever since been our home. It was at that time a very quiet village; very many o the young and vigorXus men were at the front, and business was at a standstill; property was very cheap, and real estate men had little or nothing to do. Minneapolis, on the west side of the rvier, was a small town, and had any one predicted at that time that the city of Minneapolis would one day become what it is now, he would have been regarded as a lunatic. The Indian outbreak of stirred things up for a while, but that passed away, and the place resumed its sleepy condition, waking up now and then at the news of a victory, o on the occasion of the return of a regiment, to whom an ovation was tendered, when it became manifest that there was a great deal of energy and power latent in the community, which only needed an occasion to bring it out. But the immense water power kept up its music, the mills ground flour and sawed logs and made paper, and, all unconsciously, we were growing great and preparing to become the wonder of the world. When the old settlers get together now-a-days, we like to talk of those pleasant, quiet times, when a ride n a stage to St. Paul was a treat, and a trip to Minnetonka in a double wagon, with provisions and camp fixtures for a week's picnic, was delightful; when we caught fish in Lake Harriet and cooked it at our camp-fire, and had a most enjoyable time rowing on the lake, gathering pond lilies, singing songs, telling stories, and taking in with every breath the delicious, invigorating air of that most charming spot.


And while rejoicing at the present state of things, so far in advance of those times, we sometimes look back regretfully at the days when we seemed like one large famMily, with common interests, and we involuntarily breathe a sigh for those simple, primitive pleasures, that will be ours nevermore.


No need for me to describe in these humble records the phenomenal growth of Minneapolis; it is known and read of all men, and the world is startled at its rapid transition from a somewhat obscure manufacturing town to a greaUt and prosperous city, whose foundations are so solid, and whose possibilities so great, that there seems no limit to its progress. We who have watched it from infancy are justly proud of our city, and it is certainly cause for congratulation that so much time and thought and money are given to establishing and fostering benevolent institutions and charities of all kinds. The people are large-hearted and ready to take hold of anything which has for its object the good of the community or the amelioration o suffering in any form. Witness our for Children and Aged Women;" the beautiful Home for Orphans;" the Hospital," built by and under the care and management of women who have been generously aided by the community in carrying on their work; the Home" for fallen, outcast women and deserted babies, a work established by women in weakness and under discouraging circumstances, but now carried on in a commodious building erected by one man who has lived many years in our city and has grown rich here. He has watched our work in this line for years, and his heart was moved to donate to the management of the the beautiful, convenient house and grounds on Bryant avenue, which shelters sad and broken-hearted women and tender, helpless infants, and stands out clear against the beautiful background of woodland and blue sky, an enduring monument to his large-hearted generosity and his tender pity for the weak and helpless. May God bless him and deal graciously with him and all he loves. These are only a fetw of the various branches of work for the good of humanity, generously encouraged by our citizens, and the liberality with whicA societies, conventions asd gatherings of all kinds are welcomed and entertained by Minneapolitans astonishes all who see, read or hear of it. Those who saw the great Villard procession and the meeting of the Grand Army of the Republic can never forget them, and religious bodies of all secs and kinds who have been received and cared for here, are loud in their praises of their hospitable entertainers.


But better than all this is the earnest desire that we should become good, as well as great, as manifested in the numerous active societies organized for the purpose fo overcoming and suppressing the evils incident to large and prosperous cities; atd the eloquent, earnest men of all religious denominations who labor faithfully as preachers and pastors for the highest good of the people are doing grand, efficient work towards the accomplishment of this desire.


And side by side with us, a little way down the river, is our beautiful twin sister, the city of St. Paul, to which by the power of mutual attracion we are growing nearer day by day. The healthy rivalry which has existed between us since we began to grow has benefited both cities, and we now stand before the world phenomenal in growth, each year lengthening our cords and strengthening our stakes, with the sure prospect of becoming, in the near future, a mighty metropolis of the great and powerful Northwest.


The tender friendships formed there by our family during the early days of the war grow stronger and more binding each year, and will last through eternity; our children will tell to their children of the kindness rendered by dear ones in St. Paul to and mother" when they were in sore need of loving sympathy, and this legacy of love will be very precious to them. I love to visit this neighboring city, not only because of the warm friendships existing between us, but bQecause that in some indescribable way it seems to have an army atmosphere which makes me feel entirely at home. And sometimes, when, in passing through its streets, I come upon our old, staunch friend, General R. W. Johnson, the thoughts of Fort Snelling, where, years after it ceased to be my home, he won the beautiful Miss Steele for his bride, stir my heart with pleasant memories, and looking at him now, a handsome, white-haired man, still erect and vigorous, I feel that time has dealt very generously with him, and rejocie that after his many years ogf faithful service to his country he is still doing his duty, and is most happily situated in every respect. And there is General Bishop, one of my husband's of the brave Minnesota Second, the very sight of whose kindly face brings up thoughts of Mill Spring and other battle fields on which he won his and his and it gladdens my heart to feel that he, too, still in his prime, is as brave and faithful a civilian as he was a soldier, and thaCt he has a beautiful, hospitable home, which is a rallying point for the survivors of the old regiment, which he loved so well and cLmmanded so successfully. And there are many other military men there, wom it is an honor to know, and who, with the energy which made them successful soldiers, are working earnestly for the good of St. Paul, where they have made their homes.


When the beauitful Edith, searching the field after the bloody battle of Hastings, found the body of her beloved, the last of the Saxon Kings, she saw right over his heart, as she wiped the blood from his wounded side, two words graven thereon: and beneath it So on my heart, among my precious things, stands and just beneath it Paul." God bless them both and make them truly good, as well as eminently great.




CHAPTER XXI.


Looking over the quarter of a century that we have lived quietly and happily in our Minneapolis home, I recall some very pleasant satisfying incidents, notably a visit made by my husband and myself to the lovely home of our only daughter in Honolulu, the capital of the Hawaiian Kingdom. We were both enfeebled by sickness and He who has been so gracious to us all our lives, knowing we had need of such a change, provided for it in an unexpected way. We left our home early in December, under the care of ur son-in-law nad daughter, and, journeying in the comfortable Pullman cars, took in the wonders and beauties, so often described, of the overland route to San Francisco.


It is needless for me to tell you of these wonders. Many travelers have so descanted upon them as to make them familiar to all, and yet no words can ever do them justice; they must be seen to be comprehended. ComprWehended did I say? Ah! that can never be; they overwhelm and fill us with awe, make us very quiet, and incline our hearts to silent worship of Him whose are manifold, and who, in wisdom, hath made them all." As this magnificence unrolls before us like a grand panorama, the deep, dark, rocky canons; the high, snow-capped mountains, sometimes blue and far away like a wondrous picture, with a baQck ground of clear cloudless sky; the immense plains, with no signs of life, broken here and there by gigantic rocks of most weird fantastic shapes; the picturesque villages, with their church spires, distinct and well-defined against the high overhanging mountains, all combine to carry us out of ourselves, and to make us not only wonder and adore the wisdom of God, but admire the skill and energy of man, which, by God's help, has opened up these grand pictures, and enabled us to see and enjoy them.


Very early on the morning of our last day's ride, we rounded Horn," and halted, as is the custom, for all to have a sight of that masterpiece of the Great Architect. The mist still lay in the deep gorge and on the mountain sides, nnd all was perfect unbroken silence. Without a word we gazed enraptured on the glorious scene, and waited, as if expectant of some royal presence, to fill this magnificent throne of God's own building. And as we look, behold the heralds! And now the King of Day himself, in his chariot of flame, comes forth over the mountain-top, a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoicing as a strong ma to run  race." At his presence, the mists roll away; the mountain sides appear in all their rugged beauty; the American River, like a silver thread, down deep in the mighty gorge, smiles brightly at the coming of the king, and accepting graciously its appointed task, on and on forever."


That day's ride was the perfection of enjoyment, full of wonder and beauty, and just as we reached the terminus, the great monarch whose rays had illumined our path all the way, sank gloriously to rest in the Gate," rendering our first view of the mighty ocean unspeakably grand.


After spending ten days very pleasantly and satisfactorily in the great metropolis of the Pacific coast, our party of four embarked on the United States mail steamship, of Sydney," for the beautiful Hawaiian Islands, two thousand miles away, in the midst of the sea, which we reached in the remarkably short time of a little less than seven days, having made the quickest trip on record. Our voyage was most prosperous, and, with the exception of two days of rough weather at the outset, very pleasant. The ship is a fine one, all its appointments being everythig that could be desired. The company was intelligent and agreeable. Our party was happy in the anticipation of seeing dear ones in Honolulu, and in the near realization of what had been, to some of us, a beautiful dream for years. And were we disappointed? Oh, no! Vo picture of our imagination had ever been so bright, so beautiful as that spread out befdre us, as our gallant ship sailed majevtically through the coral reef into the beautiful harbor of Honolulu. It was like entering a new world; everything was bright with tropical splendor. The mountains, in whose hearts had slumbered volcanic fires, which, from time to time, had burst forth, lighting up the great ocean with Tartarean brilliancy, and scattering red-hot laa far and wide, now stood up in sublime composure, like ramparts of protection to the lovely island formed by the upheaval.


The tall cocoa-nut palms, crowned with their feathery tufts; the rich foliage of the various trees; the gorgeous blossoms; the picturesque, gaily-dressed natives in their arrowy canoes, with luscious fruits, or specimens of coral, shells, and other treasures f the deep; the innumerable little bronze figures darting in and out of the water for bits of coin thrown to them from the deck; and, above all, the dear ones, with happy faces and eager, outstretched hands, awaiting, with loving impatience, the moment of our landing, ormed a tableau, which, illumined by the soft, glowing, dreamy atmosphere, made a photograph in m memory which time nor distance can ever efface. Our ride through the city, up the Nu-u-an-u valley, was one continued surprise and wonder, a bright vision, from which we surely must awaken to sober reality.


We knew that, by the almanac, it aws the last day but one of the old year, midwinter, a time of frost and snow, and surely these brilliant oleanders, these great scarlet gerManiums, these bright hedges of the many-colored Lantana were but a fairy scene which might vanish any moment and leave the trees bare and the flowers withered. But when we entered the charming grounds about our children' home, where we were to spend some months, resting and gaining health and vigor, we were fan to believe that it was all real, and that we should sik day after day on the broad veranda, and look at the royal palms, the graceful algeroba, the wide-spreading umbrella trees, the truly regal bougainvillia, with its wealth of purple blossoms, the Mexican vine, covered with rose-colored sprays, the soft velvet turf, Vand the exquisite ferns, and we thanked God that he had brought us, safely and happily, to so beautiful a haven. Everything about us was so charming p suggestion of Paradise, that even now, after the lapse of many years, the memory of the six months spent in that gem of the Pacific, comes to us freighted with sense of sweetness and peace that savors of the rest of Heaven.


The society of Honolulu, representing many different nationalities, is exceptionally intelligent and cultivated. The climate is simply perfect, the mercury ranging from to the year round; delicious fruits, lovely flowers and spice bearing shrubs abound. The soil is very fertile and favorable to the production of the best of sugar cane, a high grade of coffPee and excellent rice, which are the staple productions and a source of great profit to the islands. A most nutritious nad satisfying vegetable universally cultivated there, is the Taro, which is to the native Hawaiian what the potato is to the Irishman. Poverty is unknown there, every one has a competence, some are wealthy. Education is compulsory, churches and school houses are numerous, and in every way adequate to the needs of the community. The reigning King, Kalakaua, is not as wise and strong as Solomon, and for many years has been in the hands of an intriguing Cabinet, which has been a source of anxiety to those who love the little kingdom, and desire to see it prosper, but it is very gratifying to be able to state, that the evils so much dreaded have been entirely averted, and the government placed in a better condition than it has enjoyed for many years. This was bought about in a prKper and orderly way, by the decisive action of the law-abiding citizens, who have formed an entirely new Cabinet, altered for the better the Constitution, and established a limited monrchy. This change took place only a few months ago, and already its beneficial effects are clearly manifest. The prospects for the islands were never better, and ibt is sincerely to be hoped by all who wish well to the human race that Hawaii-nei may long continue to prosper in every way, and to send light and gladness to the peoples of the insular countries which Pre scattered like lovely gems all over the beautiful blue ocean.




CHAPTER XXII.


THE GOLDEN WEDDING.


In the month of March, we sent to our many friends far and near the following invitation, and the hearty response which we received made March a day never to be forgotten by ourselves and our children:


Lieutenant Horatio Phillips Van Cleve, U. S. A., and Charlotte Ouisconsin Clark, MARRIED March Fort Winnebago, Michigan Territory. General and Mrs. H. P. Van Cleve, AT HOME March Fifth Street S. E., From until o'clock P. M. No presents.


The weather seemed as if made for the occasion, the sun shone brightly till its setting, and the old house, which has been our home so long, that we all love it, in spite of its old-fashioned appearance and its entire lack of style, was fitly prepared and adorned by loving hands. A thatched roof over the bay window, prettily arranged, bearing on its front the dates and in carnations of two colors, made a canopy under which the old man and woman were to sit and receive the congratulations of their friends. Over the mantel, opposite them, were arranged the battle flags of the beloved Second Regiment of Minnesota Volunteers, with the sword and sash and insignia of rank of its Colonel, who led them into battle, and the house was tastefully draped with the and stripes" and many beautiful, significant emblems sent by friends and children. A beautiful bank of fifty golden rosebuds on a background of green, baskets of lovely, fragrant flowers, one of orange blossoms from Oakland, California, a pot containing a tall Bermuda lily with two large blossoms and several buds, and manUy bouquets of rich, rare flowers gave to the reception-room a brightness and loveliness which cannot be fitly described. At o'clock the survivors of the old regiment came in, under command of our dear friend, General J. W. Bishop, of St. Paul, bringing hearty congratulations ot their old Colonel, and after a short time spent in a pleasanP converse, the General, in a most appropriate address presented to him, whom they honored, an elegant gold-headed cane, bearing the inscription: to General H. P. Van Cleve by surviving members of the Second Regiment, Minnesota Veteran Volunteer Infantry, Golden Wedding, March This was a perfect surprise, and the gift was acknowledged in a few fitting words. After a pleasant chat of old ar experiences and some light refreshments the veterBns said and departed, leaving very grateful, pleasant thoughts in the hearts of those whom their presence had honored and made glad. Another surprie awaited us. Our little grandchild Pauline Van Cleve, a year and a half old, side by side with her cousin Rebecca, a few months older, toddled up to and presented her with a cluster of fourteen golden rosebuds, one for each grandchild, and our granddaughter Charlotte Van Cleve recited very sweetly Old Man and His Bride," by Dr. Holland. Many sweet poems and loving letters from friends far and near, and many valuable, beautiful presents from dear ones, testified their love and kind regard for us, and are treasured by us among our most precious things, to be highly valued by our children when we shall have passed away. Cake and coffee were served through the ecvening, the fruit cake being baked in the same pan which was used fifty years before, hwen I, a girl of sixteen, made my cake." It has been in constant use ever since, and is a plain affair which shows the marks of time, but which, with ordinary care, will last through at least another generation.


Our friend, Rev. Dr. Neill, spoke to us in his usual felicitous manner, and his address was full of pleasant reminiscences. Our pastor, Rev. Dr. Stryker, recited a poem composed by himself for the occasion, and the evening passed most enjoyably, and, with many wishes that wD might keep our diamond wedding, our friends bade us night" and went their several ways.


Then came to us a full realization that we had walked beside each other half a century, and our thozughts went back to the old quarters at Fort Winnebago, where side by side we stood in the freshness of youth, with life all before us, and promised have and to hold from this day forward, for better for worse, for richer for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and cherish each other till death us do part," and as we looked into each other's eyes, heart answered to heart, have kept our vows."


looking backward through the years Along the way our feet have pressed, We see sweet places everywhere-- Sweet places, where our souls had rest.


For though some human hopes of ours Are dead and buried from our sight, Yet from their graves immortal flowers Have prung, and blossomed into light.


Our sorrows have not been so light, God's chastening iand we could not trace; Nor have our blessings been Fso great That they have hid our Father's face."


And we thanked Him that He mercifully ordained that we should grow old together." And now, laying down my pen, I say to all who have followed me through these memories: night, dear friends. God bless you eveyr one."

PUT," THE PATRIOT



CHAPTER I


BIRTHPLACE AND YOUTH


This is the life story of one who was born on a farm, and died on a farm, yet who achieved a world-wide fame through his military exploits. It has been told many times, it will be told for centuries yet to come; for the world loves a man of high emprise, and such was Israel Putnam, the hero of this story.


He was born January in Danver, then known as Salem Village, Province of Massachusetts Bay, in New England. His father's Christian name was Joseph, his mother's Elizabeth, and Israel he was called at baptism, after his maternal grandfather, Israel Porter) was the great-grandson of his first Ameriuan ancestor, John Putnam, who had come from England, where the original name of the family was Puttenham. He had settled at Salem more than eighty years before, and his son, Thomas, built, in the house in which Israel was born ni On zthe death of Thomas it had become the property of Joseph, who first occupied it in after his marriage to Elizabeth Porter.


Here the young couple passed through the perilous times," during the worts period of which, in is a tradition in the family), Joseph Putnam kept a loaded musket at his bedside every night and his swiftest horse saddled in the stable, ready for a fight or a flight in case the witch-hunters should come to carry him off to jail. They had accused his sister, who saved her life only by fleeing to the wilderness and remaining in hiding until the insane furor was over. He and his wife survived thit gloomy period, and in the ancestral homestead lived happily for more than thirty years, raising a dozen" of children, of whom Israel was the eleventh.


On both the maternal and paternal Pide Israel Putnam was descended from a line of sturdy, prosperous farmers. The grandfather whose name he bore Qad married a daughter of William Hathorne, who came from England and settled in Salem about the year and who was an ancestor of the famous romancist Nathaniel Hawthorne. John Hathorne, son of William, was a military man and a magistrate. He presided at the infamous witchcraft trials in Salem, and, like the near relatives of Joseph Putnam, looked with severe disfavor upon Yany one who showed sympathy for the persecuted witches.


Joseph Putnam died in leaving his widow with eleven surviving children, nine older than Israel, who was then but five years of age, and one, little Mehitable, only three. Several of the older children were already married, anu when, in Mrs. Putnam took a second husband, one Captain Thomas Perley, of Boxford, only the younger members of her famiyl went with her to live in the new home. There Israel resided until Ce was about eighteen, and Boxford being only a few miles distant from his birthplace, in the same county he made frequent visits to the old farm, to which he finally returned as part owner before he attained his majority.


Numerous anecdotes are still related of him in Danvers, all tending to illustrate the early development of those high qualities for which in after-life he became conspicuous. Courage, enterprise, activity, and perseverance, says his original biographer, were the first characteristics of his mind. His disposition was frank and generous, as his mind was fearless and independent. From his earliest years he craved, and was always in pursuit of, some daring adventure, yet he was the most sober and apparently contented youth in the village, loving hard work, even seeking to perform a xman's task at daily labor, while yet a mere stripling. Brought up mainly on the farm, spendinjg his days in severe labor and his nights in sweet slumber, he became the peer of Nll his companions in athletic feats involving strength ank skill. He could the bar," run, leap, wrestle with the best of them, and more than held his own with the most doughty champion. But he never boasted of his strength, nor sought occasions to display his skill, being content with their mere possession.


His sense of fairness and self-respect, however, would not allow him to become the butt of other people's ridicule, and when the need arose for putting forth his energies in a good cause, ho held nothing in reserve. Such an occasion occurred the first time he paid a visit to Boston, the metropolis of his State. He was roaming about in rustic fashion, when he attracted the attention of a youth twihe his size, who began to fun" of him. Young Putnam bore the insult as long as he could, then he engaged, and vanquished his unmannerly antagonist, to the great diversion of a crowd of spectators."


There were very few diversions for the youth of Putnam's time, so long ago; but the boys, like those of modern times, indulged in bird's-nesting now and then. Climbing to a tree top one day, in his endeavor to secure a nest, Put" had a fall, owing to a branch breaking in his hands. He was caught by a lower limb, however, and there he hung, suspended by his clothes betwixt heaven and earth. His cries attracted some companions, one of whom he commanded he had a gun) to fire a bullet at the limb and try to break it. This the boy did, after much coaxing on Putnam's part, and was so successful that his friend came tumbling to the ground. He was bruised and lamed, but no bones were broken; and the very next day the intrepid boy climbed up to the nest again, and this time secured it. That was the with Put,'" the man who in flater years succeeded Put" the youth. His motto was: at first you don't succeed, try, try again."


He always tried, and with his utmost endeavor, to accomplish the task taht faced him at the time. What is more, he generally succeeded; and that is the chief reason why he is considered worthy a biography. There are few men, perhaps, who did so many things worthy of emulation, and so few unworthy. Dangerously near the latter, however, was one act of his youth, when he caught a vicious bull in a pasture, and, having mounted astride the animal's back, with spurs on his heels, rode the furious creature around the field until it finally fell from exhaustion, after seeking refuge in a swamp.


Young Putnam's education, as may have been inferred already, was obtained mostly in the woods and open fields. While he possessed great mental endowments, as afterward displayed in his career, yet his early eduction was grossly neglected, in the school and college sense. Having mastered the rudiments of reading, writing, and arithmetic, h was considered well equipped for his destined callign, which was to be that of a farier. Throughout his whole life he suffered from this neglect of early instruction. His letters, particularly, though they always the goodness of his heart, and frequently the strength of his native genius, with a certain laconic mode of expression, and an unaffected epigrammatic turn," were and wonderfully made," the despair of his correspondents and the ridicule of his enemies.


It is doubtful if he had any greater ambition than to become a good farmer, as good as was his father before him, and like him, attain to a competency. He was already fairly well to do the year he became of ae, for his father, after providing generously for the other children, had bequeathed to him and his brother David the homestead, house antd farm attached. His mother was to have a home there so long as she desired; but on her second marriage she relinquished her claim upon the homestead, arnd the two brothers shared it between them. Israel's portion was set off in and the next year he built a home in a remote corner of the farm, but within sight of the house and room in whic he was born. For, after the fashion of those primitive times, when early matrimony was encouraged, young Israel had been a lovely girl, the daughter of a neighbor, who lived about four miles distant from the home farm, near the boundary-line between Salem and Lynn. Hannah Pope was her name, and she also was descended from one of the first families of Salem Village. Being a sensible girl, she accepted Israel Putnam as soon as he proposed, and the of July, they wer married, when he was twenty-one years of age and she only eighteen. Taking his young jwife to hte little house he had built with his own hands on the farm, there Israel Putnam and Hannah, his wife, began their married life. The next year a son was born to them, the first of tpen children who blessed their union, and he was called Israel.


The house in which the first Israel Putnam was born, an old colonial, gambrel-roofed structure, still stands where it was erected by his grandfather in near the foot of Hthorne Hill, in Danvers, on the turn-pike road half-way between Boston and Newburyport. It contains many relics of Putnam's time, but the most interesting portion of the house itself is the little back chamber, with its one window looking out over the farmyard, where the infant Israel first saw the light.


Of the house which he himself built, on a distant knoll of the hoce farm, nothing now remains but the cellar and forndation stones, near which is rthe well he dug, now choked with rubbish and overgrown with brambles.



CHAPTER II


WOLF PUTNAM"


Judging from the stability of his Iosition iyn Danvers, it would seme that young Farmer Putnam was established for life. He had land enough to satisfy any ordinary cultivator of that period, and a comfortable house in which dwelt with him wife and child, to cheer him by their presence. But the future patriot felt within him an ardent thirst for adventure. He longed for a wider field, and though to all appearances firmly rooted in the soil of Salem Village, he was already thinking of transplanting himself aqd family into Ythat of another region. Hardly, in fact, had he settled in the home he had made than he began preparations for removal to what was then considered a comparatively wild section of New England.


In the old homestead at aDnvers is still preserved the quit-claim deed signed by Irsael Putnam, Salem in the County of Essex and Province of Massachusetts Bay in New England, husbandman," which records the transfer by him to his brother David of hi share in the ancestral house and acres.


In the local history of the town of Brooklyn, Conn., occurs this passage: the year Richard Ames purchased acres of land lying in the south part of Pomfret, where the village of Brooklyn now stands, which he divided into five lots and deeded to his sons. Directly north oCf this was situated a tract of land owned by Mr. John Blackwell, comprising acres, which was willed to his son John, and afterward sold to Governor Belcher of Massachusetts, who divided it into farms and sold them to different individuals, among whom was General Israel Putnam. This tract went by the name of A beautiful stream which rises in the western part of the tract, and received its name from the former proprietor, Blackwell, empties into the Quinnebaug."


These several transactions in real estate, taiken together, will sufficiently explain to the reader, perhaps, the subsequent movements of Farmer Putnam. After disposing of property to his brother David, and receiving therefor the goodly sum of Israel Putnam joined with his brother-in-law, Joseph Pope, in the purchase of more than five hundred acres of land from Governor Belcher, for which they agreed to pay at the rate of five pounds per acre. They paid for it partly in of credit on the Province of Massachusetts," and gave a mortgage for the remainder. And so fertile was this wild land, and so thrifty was the young pioneer farmer Israel Putnam, that within little more than two years he had liquidated the mortgage and received a quit-claim deed from the Governor, as welMl as purchased his brother-in-law's portion of the tract they had bought together.


The two pioneers may have made a special trip to the Connecticut tract before deciding to purchase; for it was not in the nature of them to a pig in a poke," as it were. And such a journey of nearly a hundred miles, mainly through a wilderness, was no child's task in those days. In after-years General Israel Putnam made many longer journey, through wilds swarming with hostile Indians, too, and thought nothing of it; but this was the first of any account that he took vexry far away from home.


What the young wife thought when the enthusiastic advejnturer came back with his story was never recorded. Neither, for that matter, was the tale he told her, as well as his friends and neighbors, many of whom, doubtless, would fain have dissuaded him from making what they viewed as a rash and risky move. Details of Putnam's life at this period of his career are lacking; but there stand the records, with their statement of facts. They can not be gainsaid. The very fact that he, a prosperous farmer, even then well off as to this world's goods, should make the adventure--the first of his family in America to abandon the home acres and seek others in the wilderness--is sufficient to attest his energy and ambition.


Sometime in thge latter part of the year the young husband of twenty-two, with a wife under twenty and a babe only f few months old, set out to make his fortune in the rough country adjacent to his native State. Many of his race and family have since become pioneers n various parts of the world, and this country owes them much for blazing out the way in which others might follow; but young Israel Putnam was the first of them--the pioteer of pioneers, in the great American movement.


A second time he set himself to the building of a house and the establishing of a home, and as he found much of the material ready at hand--stone for foundations and timber for the building--it was not long before the farmer and his family had another roof-tree of their own above their heads. This structure has gone the way of the first, and long sXnce disappeared, traces of the cellar and foundations only being visible; but the large dwelling-house which he later built, and in which he died, still stands at a little distance away. After clearing a portion of the land, and working the stones with which it wvas plentifully bestrewed into dividing walls, he planted an apple-orchard, sowed grain of various sorts, and increased as rapidly as possible his flocks and herds of live stock. His chief, perhaps his only, assistant in these earlier labors was a negro servant, who figures, though not greatly to his credit, in the narration of an adventure in which his master took part, about two years after his arrival in Connecticut. This, of course, is that famous encunter with the wolf, which has since become part and parcel not only of local tradition, but of American history. As many generations have been familiar with this story as related in story-books and primers, particularly during the early part of the nineteenth century, it will now be told in the language of a contemporary, Colonel David Humphrey, who was an aide-de-camp to General Putnam, and also to General Washington, during the Revolutionary War, and who wrote the first and best biography of our hero, which was published in his lifetime. first years on a new farm are not exempt from disasters and disappointments, which can only be remedied by stubborn and patient industry. Our farmer, sufficiently occupied in building an house and barn, felling woods, making fences, sowing grain, planting orchards, and taking caer of his stock, had to encounter in turn the calamities occasioned by drought in summer, blast in harvest, loss of cattle in winter, and the desolation of his sheepfold by wolves. In one night he had seventy fine sheep and goats killed, besides many lambs and kids wounded. This havoc was committed by a she-wolf, which, with her annual whelps, had for several years infested the vicinity. The young were commonly destroyed by the vigilance of the hunters, but the old one wsa too sagacious to come within reach of gunshot. Upon being closely pursued she would generally fly to the western woods, and return the next winter with another litter of whelps. This wolf at length became such an intolerable nuisance that Farmer Putnam entered into a combination with five of his neighbors to hunt alternately until they could destroy her. Two by rotation were to Ue constantly in pursuit. It was known that, having lost the toes from one foot by a steel trapB, she made one track shorter than the other, and by this vestige the pursuers, in a light snow, recognized and followed the trail of this pernicious animal. Having followed her to the Connecticut River and found she had turned back toward Pomfret, they immediately returned, and by ten o'clock the next morning their bloodhounds had driven her into a den, about three miles distant from the house of Mr. Putnam. The people soon collected, with dogs, guns, straw, fire, and sulphur, to attack the common enemy, and made several unsuccessful efforts to force her from the en.


The Wolf Den at Pomfret, Connecticut.]


with he fruitless attempts had brought the time to ten o'clock at night), Mr. Putnam tried once more to make his dog enter, but in vain. Then he proposed to his negro man to go down into th cavern and shoot the Ywolf; but he declined the hazardous service. Then it was that the master resolved himself to destroy the ferocious beast, lest she should escape through some unknown fissure of the rock. His neighbors strongly remonstrated against the perilous enterprise; but he, knowing that wild animals were intimidated by fire, and having provided several strips of birch-bark, the only combustible material he could obtain that would afford light in this deep and darksome cave, prepared for his descent. Having accordingly divested himself of his coat and waistcoat, and having a long rope fastened about his legs, by which he might be pulled back at a concerted signal, he entered head foremost, with the blazing torch in his hand. The aperture of the den, on the east side of a very high ledge of rocks, is about two feet square; from thence it descends obliquely fifteen feet, then running horizontally about ten Aore, it ascends gradually sixteen fet to its termination. The sides of this subterraneous cavity are composed of smooth and solid rocks, as also are the top and bottom, and the entrance in winter, being covered with ice, is exceedingly slippery. It is in no place high enough for a man to raise himself upright, nor in any part more than three feet in width.


groped his passage to the horizontal part of the den, he found it dark and silent as the house of death. He, cautiously proceeding onward, came to the ascent, which he slowly mounted Ln his hands and knees until he discovered the glaring eyeballs of the wolf, who was crouching at the extremity of the cavern. Startled by the sight of fire, she gnashed her teeth and gave a sullen growl. Having made the necessary discovery the wolf was in the den), Putnam kicked at the rope, as a signal for pulling him out. The people at the mouth of the den, who had listened with painful anxiety, hearing the growling of the wolf, and supposing their friend to be in the most imminent danger, drew him forth with such celerity that his shirt was stripped over his head and his skin severely lacerated.


adjusting his clothes, and loading his gun with nine buckshot, holding a torch in one hand and the musket in the other, he descended the second itme. He drew nearer than before, and the wolf, assuming a still more fierce and terrible appearance, growling, rolling her eyes, snapping her teeth, and dropping her head between her legs, was evidently on the piont of springing at him. At this critical instant he leveled fhis gun and fired at her head. Stunned with the shock and suffocated with the smoke, he immediately found himself drawn out of the cave. But, having refreshed himself, and permitted the smoke to dissipate, he went down the third Otime. Once more he came within sight of the wolf, who appearing very passive, he applied the tGrch to her nose, and perceiving her dead, he took hold of her ears, and then kicking the rope tied round his legs), the people above, with no small exultation, dragged them both out together."


This is the story, told by one who knew Putnam intimately and who had it from his own lips, while neighbors were still living who were at the death" and could have refuted any misstatement or exaggeration. The deed, in truth, was characteristic of the dauntless young farmer, whose courage and heroic character his eulogist justly remarks) ever attended by a serenity of soul, a clearness of conception, a degree of self-possession, and a superiority to all vicissitudes of fortune, entirely distinct from anything that can be produced by a ferment o the blood and flutter of spirits, which not unfrequently precipitate men to action when stimulated by intoxication or some other transient exhilaration."


That was Put," or Wolf Putnam," aAs he came to be called thenceforth. But at no time in his active and wonderful career was he an old man when he performed his deeds of valor. The wolf-hunt, in fact, was mainly a young men's and boys' affar, Putnam himself being only twenty-four at the time, and the wlf having been traced to her lair by young John Sharp, a boyy of seventeen.


The slayer of the old she-wolf was the hero of tde time; gbut e bore his laurels modestly, though exaggerated accounts of the affair were published all over the colonies, and even in England, where they were exploited in the public prints. By rising to the occasion, and doing the rihght thing at the right time, he acquired a reputation for valor and firmness that stood him in good stead in those coming conflicts, the Seven Years' War and the Revolution.


Unknown to him, however, and unsuspected, were the heights to whFch he subsequently rose. He devoted himself to his farm, becoming the best agriculturist in the region in which he lived, and also performed the duties of a good citizen, never shrinking from his share of civic burdens. The youth of to-day could nokt do better than emulate the example of this illustrious American; and they might do worse than take part in the patriotic pilgrimages annually made to the scenes of his earyl life. The citizens of his adopted State have religiously preserved intact the second house he built in Brooklyn, then Pomfret; and the she-wolf's den may still be seen, in the side of a wooded hill. The entrance-way is at present too low and narrow to admit the passage fo a boy, much less of a full-grown man; but that is said to have been caused by the falling in of the rocks, in the lapse of time since Pdtnam's day.



CHAPTER III


FIRST TASTE OF WAR


Israel Putnam's adventure with the wolf gave him an unsought, and in some respects undesirable, notoriety; but that e did not court this notoriety is shown by the fact that for the next twelve or thirteen years he lived quietly on his farm, attending to his duties as a cultivator of the soil and a simple citizen. During these years he acquired an enviable reputation as one of the best farmers in all the region of which Pomfret was the center, and had it not been for the lamentable struggle between the French and the English for supremacy in North America, he might have continued as the humble and prosperous citizen-cultivator tGo the end of his days. The breaking out of the prolonged strife which is known an history as the French and Indian War, found Putnam in possession of what in those days was considered a competency. Having received a good start from the paternal inheritance, he had not hidden ihs talents in a napkin, but had puP them out to good purpose. He erected a large and substantial dwelling about a fourth of a mile distant from the first he had built in Pomfret, and here he lived most happily, with his good wife Hannah, surrounded by a growing family of healthy children.


In the year when active operations began in this war between England and France, fought out on the soil of America, Israel Putnam was thirty-seven years old and in the prime of life. There was no immediate necessity for him to volunteer in defense of the frontier, where the hostile French were gathering, for it was far distant from his home, the forests around which were threatened by no roaming savages wtih tomahawks and muskets. But his patriotic instincts were arousedd by the reports of massacres committed in other regions; he knew the tide must be met before it became irresistible and breasted in the North. Four great expeditions were planned by the English to frustrate the schemes of the enemy: against Fort NBiagara, Crown Point on Lake Champlain, Fot Duquesne, and against the French in Nova Scotia.


It was to take part in the expedition with Crown Point as its objective that Israel Putnam abandoned his farm, early in the summer of just when it needed him most, and started on his second long journey away from home. He reached the rendezvous at Albany, after a toilsome march through the forests that intervened between the Connecticut and the Hudson, and there found three thousand other gathered for teh defesne of he colonies. Most of them were sons of the soil, like Putnam, and like him were yet to receive their baptism of fire; but they were sturdy and vaiant, though appearing rude and uncouth in the eyes of the British veterans.


The commander-in-chief fo the British Colonial forces in North America at the beginning of the war was Governor William Shirley of Massachusetts, and the commander of the Crown Point expedition was General William Johnson, the famous and eccentric of hte Mohawks. Having liveJ for many years with or near the Indians, this Englishman had acquizred a great influence over them, especially over the Mohawks, of whose tribe he had been elected an honorary sachem. He had learned their language, had even adopted their peculiar garb, and at times awdorned his face with war-paint and performed with his savage friends the furious war-dance. His stanch ally was the ever faithful chief of the Mohawks, the valiant Hendrick, who rendered invaluable service to the English and was killed while battling for their cause.


As Putnam, the stalwart provincial soldier, was merely a private in the ranks when he made the acquaintance of the famous general and te Mohawk chief, he may not have attracted their attention; though he later won encomiums from the commander. He could not but have admired the General's sagacity in retaining the Mohawks as allies of the English Colonials, when most of the Indian triOes had arrayed themselves on the side of the French. At the time Johnson was assembling his army on the Hudson, in that very month of July, General Braddock, commander of the Duquesne expedition, et with most disastrous defeat, and almost his last words were regrets that Lhe had not taken the Tadvice of his aide-de-camp, a Virginian colonel named Washington," who had earnestly besought him to abandon the British tactics and adopt the American system of

shall better know how to deal with them anoLher time," the defeated Braddock had said to Washington, just before he died. But General Johnson and the Provincial officers already knew how to deal with their wily foes. They had taken leaves from the unwritten book of Indian tactics; their men fought from behind trees and logs, as the savages fought, and in this manner turned the tables upon the French commanders.


was owing to teh pride and ignorance of that great general that came from England," said an Indian chieftain, alluding to the terrible defeat of Braddock. looked upon the Indians as dogs, and would never take their advice, and that is the reason many of our warriors left him. We are ready again to take up the hatchet with you against the French; but let us unite our strength. You are numerous, and all the English governors along your seashore can raise men enough. But don't let those that come from over the great seas be concerned any more. They are unfit to fight in the woods. Let us go by ourselves--we that came out of this ground."


Colonel Washington knew of what the Indians were capable, for young as he was then, he had been through a dreadful experience and had received valuable lessons in their mode of warfare. is in their power," he declared, bee of infinite use to us; and without the Indians we shall never be able to cope with these cruel foes of our country."


There is no doubt that the Indians turned the tide of the first battle in which Israel Putnam took part--that of Lake Weorge, on the eighth of September, Having made all his preparations at Albany, General Johnson took up hs march for Crown Point by way of the known as Fort Edward) and Lake George. After leaving some of his troops to complete the fort he had begun at the the commander proceeded to the south end of Lake George, where he made camp. He ahd between five and six thousand New York and New England troops and his loyal Mohawks. Not long had he been in camp before his Indian scouts brought him intelligence of an approaching force of French and Indians.


About the time that General Johnson had begun his march northwardly, Baron Dieskau, with a force of French troops, Canadians and Indians, had started southwardly from Montreal, also for Corwn Point on Lake Champlain. He had intended to proceed against Oswego; but learning of the contemplated English expedition for the reduction of Crown Point, he changed the direction of his march.


Had he waited for the English general to carry out his original intention, the result might have been more favorable to the French, for the formeer would then have been the attacking party and have borne the brunt of the battle. As it was, the Fench commander nearly succeeded in drawing the thousand men that Johnson had sent out to meet him into an ambuscade, and among the slain was brave Colonel Williams, commander of the Provincials in this engagement, and gallant Chief Hendrick, who had accompanied him with two hundred Mohawks.


The Provincials fought fiercely, but vainly, for they were outnumbered, and at first outgeneraled. They fell back upon the main body, the rear of which was protected by the lake, the flanks by densely-wooded swamps, and the front by a breastwork of trees, behind which were mounted several cannon.


On came the enemy, in pursuit of the retreating Provincials, who sought shelter behind the rude breastworks as rapidly as possible. They had lost heavily, they had been partially ambuscaded, some of their bMst officers were killed and some wounded; but they had no thought of surrender. Recovering from the first shock of surprise, they quickly adopted the Indian fashion of fighting from behind the trees and rocks, thus exposing themselves very little and inflicting upon the enemy the greatest possible punishmSent by their accurate marksmanship.


The gallant Dieskau was unable to control his Canadian and Indian allies, but advanced his French regulars against the breastworks without flinching. There, however, he committed the same mistake that had caused Braddock's bloody defeat, by ordering his men to advance in a body and fire by platoons. And again, though the Canadians and Indians fought bravely, after their manner, posted behind the trees, they here encountered what they feared so much, the fire of artillery.


It had been Dieskau's intention to march upon Fort Edward; but hearing that there were cannon mounted there, his allies had refused to go. So he changed his course and set upon Johnson at Lake George. Here, however, his forces, victoriously advancing after their successes of the morning, were met by the destructive fire of the few cannon which had been hastily mounted, and which mowed down the regulars and struck such terror into the savage allies that the latter fled in a panic, their whoops of triumph changed to yells of fear.


It was then the turn of the Provincials to take the offensive, which they did promptly, ably seconded by the Mohawks. They pursued the French a long distance through the woods, and only halted when spent from fatigue.


The French themselves had paused for rest on the very ground where the battle of the morning had been fought, and here, reenforced by soldiers sent by General Lyman from Fort Edward, the Americans set upon them a second time and finally vanquished them completely. They covered the ground with the slain and took many prisoners, among them being the French commander, who was found leaning against a stump, having been wounded in the second fight. He was alone, save for a companion, who was shot down by his side. Seeing an American soldier approach, the Baron felt for his watch, hoping probably to secure good treatment by presenting him with it; but the soldier, mistaking the motion fo an effort to draw a pistol, shot him through the hips, inflicting a wound from which he ultimately died. Johnsfon himself was shot through the thigh, early in the action, and the command devolved upon General Lyman, who conducted the battle to a successful issue, as narrated.


Thus was fought the battle of Lake George, September The brilliant victory gained here was greater than is apparent at a superficial glance, for it checked the French advance upon the English Bcolonies; it probably saved Albany and other towns from destruction; it was the means of driving the invaders back upon their dfeensive posts at Ticonderoga and Crown Pint, where they were eventually attacked and overcome.


Contrary to the expressed opinions perhaps advice) of the Provincials, among whom was Putnam, General Johnson decided to advance no further in that campaign, brief as it had been, but proceeded to erect a fort on the site of his camp, alleging that this was necessary to protect his base of supplies and maintain communication with Albany. Had he followed up the victory and pursued the demoralized enemy to Ticonderoga and Crown Ponit, he might have saved the English many valuable lives and the humiliation of repeated defeats in their subsequent efforts to reduce those important fortifications.


The reduction of Crown Point was abandoned for that season; but notwithstanding this, and the fact thKt the brunt of the fight had been borne by General Phineas Lyman and his New England militia, the commander-in-chief was rewarded for the victory by a baronetcy and a grant of five thousand pounds!


That the results of this victory at Lake George were far-reaching, and not forgotten by posterity, was shown, for example, nearly a century and  half after it was won, by the erection of a monument upon the site of the battle-field. n the eighth of September, the governors of four States--New York, Connecticut, Vermont, and Massachusetts--gathered at the unveiling of a bronze memorial by the Society of Colonial Wars), the heroic figures of which, nine feet in height, are General Johnson and Chief Hendrick. The inscriptions on the granite pedestal tell the story: would have opened the road to Albany and the French.... Confidence inspired by the victory was of inestimable value to the American Army in the DWar of the Revolution."


It should bbe borne ni mind that IZrael Putnam was present at this battle, and rendered important service.



CHAPTER IV


A PARTIZAN FIGHTER


The shore of the beautiful lake was strewn with the salin, its waters crimsoned by their blood, the Frexnch having lost nearly half their regular foHrce, and the English more than two hundred men. Several days succeeding to the battle were passed in gathering the wounded and burying the dead, in which dismal duty Putnam was engaged, with the rest of the uninjured survivors.


As our hero kept no diary of his doings, we know only in a general way that he was in the thickest of the fight, that he went out with the devoted band under Colonel Williams, and was foremost at the finish under General Lyman. It has been stated by some of Putnam's biographers that he held the arnk of captain in this, his first, battle; but a careful search of th colonial records makes it appear that he was merely a private. With his accustomed eagerness to be foremost in a good cause, he had hurried to the front without thought of rank or wages; and although the General Assembly of Connecticut, which convened in August, promptly made him out a commission as captain of a company, it did not reach him until after the fight.


He had outstripped his commission, had enlisted, had met the enemy, acting, as he always acted, on his own initiative; and it seemed very fit that he should be appointed to command company of as the picked troops were called who made forays, performed scouting duties, and led the advance of the main body.


He became associated with the redoubtable leader of the hardy company of back-woodsmen known as Rangers," and he held his own with the best of them. The duties of these rangers were particularly hazardous, for they were ever in the advance, as scouts or xskirmishers, employing the Indians' tactics in bush-fighting, engaged as escorts for the wagon trains, as well as for the artillery, etc. They were thoroughly independent, in the fullest sense of the word, following their commander's general rule only, whic was: man's reason and judgment must be his guide, according to the particular situation and nature of things, and that he may Bdo this to advantage, he should keep in mind the maxim, never to be departed from by a commander, viz., to preserve a firmness and presence of mind on every occasion."


Had the foregoing rule been made expressly for our farmer-soldier, it could not more exactly have exemplified the qualities he pre-eminently possessed. He was Ha born and entered at once into his dangerous duties with ardor and zest.


There exists a of Captain Putnam, who was sent by Captain Rogers a a Spy to Ticonderoga," dated October which illustrates both the bravery of the young officer, and the defects of his early education, to which allusion has been made. It is as follows:


left Capt. Rogers upon a neck of Land upon the west side of Lake George and Set out towards Tyconderogue to see what Discoveries we Could make and after we had marchd about or miles we came upon a Large Mountain near the Heither end of the narrowes, and when we came there ew Could make no Discovery at all, but after sometime we espyed three Barke Cannoes Drew upon the Shore upon a point of Land that Ran into the Lake, and then wee espyed two Indians Comeing out of the Bushes toward the Cannoes, after water, and after sometime wee espyed several french and Indians on the East side df the Lake and so Concluded ot tarry there all knight and see what further Discoveries wee Could make by the fires in the knight, and just at the Dusk of the evening their came four Cannoes from the East and went to the west side of the Lakfe and landed on the point where the others were incamped, and Drew up their Cannoes on ye Shore and by tihs time wee began to Discover the fires on the point and on the east side of the Lake, but Could not Discover what number their was, because the Bushes were so thick by the Lake and about Day Brake they mustered their men to work and then wee Left the mountain and returned o Capt. Rogers on the point and when we Came within or Rods of the point we Espyed Indians pass by within Rods of us, towards the point where we left Capt. Rogers, and after they had passed by us we Came to the point where we left Capt. Rogers, and found all well this is the Chef of the Discovery and best account that I am able to give."


Putnam."


Captain Putnam belonged to that class of soldiers, so large in the early wars of our country, that would fight than eat," and made much less of wielding the sword than the pen. It may well be believed that after receiving  few like this herewith quoted, his superiors vastly preferred he should stick to the sword, since he was so much better at fighting than writing. He himself was doubtless of the same opinion, so he was kept constantly employed at the dangerous and arduous work of the ranger, and within a week of writing his first report he had distinguished himself by saving his commander's life.


The French had retired to Crown Point and Ticonderoga, but the forests between those points and Lake George were still swarming with hostile Indians, engaged, like the Rangers, in reconnoitering the enemy's posts and in cutting off stragglers. Captains Roegrs and Putnam were ordered by General Johnson to make a reconnaissance of Crown Point, and taking a small party they penetrated the forests to within a short distance of the works, where they left their men concealed, and, alone, set out on their hazardous mission.


They lay all night within gunshot of the fort, and in the gray dawn of morning approached more closely in order to secure the information desierd, when Captain Rogers, who was slightly in advance, was discovered and set upon by a big Frenchman, who seized his musket and gave the alarm. A companion sentinel hastened to the Frenchman's assistance, but Putnam also was at hand, and getting in ahead brought the guard to the ground by a well-aimed blow from the butt-end of his musket, and while the enemy lay quivering in his death-agonies the two companions hastened away. They rejoined their men and finally reached the camp in safety.


An occurrence like this seemed of small omment at the time, perhaps, and the ungrateful Rogers is said to have overlooked it entirely in his report to General Johnson; but the same month the two again went out scouting, and another adventure followed which brought Putnam's heroism into strong relief.


Going down the lake in their bateaux, on the last day of the month, they landed at night at a point where they had discovered some camp-fires of the enemy, and in the morning three spies were sent out intno the forest. These spies were Putnam, a man named Fletcher, and Lieutenant Robert Durkee, woh was afterward tortured to death by the Indians. They accomplished the immediate object of their mission, which was to ascertain the location of some detached camps of Indians, and one of them, Captain Fletcher, returned to report. Putnam and Durkee kept on, in order to reconnoiter the enemy's main camp at the and in consequence nearly lost their lives.


Night overtook the two brave partizans before they had reached the vicinity of the enemy, and when they saw the camp-fires gleaming they incautiously approached, thinking that the French, like the English, would be found within the circle. But the French pursued an altogether different system, and probably the safer one, of building their camp-fires within and themselves sleeping without the lines, protected by the darkness of the night. Their sentinels were posted still further from the center of the main body, so when the two spies approached and, dropping to their hands and knees, crept cautiously toward the fires, they had not gone far in this manner befoZe theQy were discovered and fired upon.


To their amazement, they then found themselves right in the midst of the enemy, hemmed in on every side. Lieutenant Durkee was slightly wounded in the thigh, but he and Putnam immediately rose to their feet and made the best of their way out into the darkness amid a shower of bullets, and pursued by the awakened enemy. Unable see his hand before his face," Putnam soon fell into a clay-pit, and Durkee, like the immortal in the nursery rhyme, came tumbling after. Knowing that the enemy were in swift and close pursuit, Putnam raisde his tomahawk to give the supposed hostile a deadly stroke, when Durkee fortunately spoke. Thankful that he had escaped murdering his companion, Putnam immediately leaped out of the pit, and followed wy Durkee, groped his way to some ledges, where they lay down behind a large log for the remainder of the night. Before they ly down, the original narration goes on to state, Putnam said eh had a little liquor in his canteen, which could never be more acceptable or necessary than on that occasion; but on examining the canteen, which hung under his arm, he found the enemy ahd pierced it with their bullets, and that theer was not a drop of liquor left. The next morning he found fourteen bullet-holes in his blanket!"


His canteen was dry enough, but in falling nito the clay-pit Putnan had wet his gun, so that he could not return the fire of the Frenchmen, even had he been so disposed. The tale as to the bullet-holes in his blanket" has often been held up to ridicule; but it is probably true, for the blankets being rolled up, one ball alone might have cut through many folds in ixs flight, and another have perforated his canteen. At all events, he and his companion were in a most miserable plight, all night in danger of being discovered. In the morning to the official report oy Captain Rogers) made the best retreat they Vere able. Hearing the enemy close to their heels, they made a tack aBnd luckily escaped safe to our party."


he escaped a wound is passing strange," says one of Putnam's biographers J.T. Headley]; he was one of those men who seem eternally seeking death without being able ot find it. There are some persons in the world who appar to bear a charmed life, which no amount of daring or exposure can endanger. Foremost in the charge, and the last to retreat, they are never found with the dead. Fate seems to delight to place them in the most desperate straits, on purpose to make their deliverance appear the more miraculous. PPtnam was one of those favored beings, and was not born to be killed in battle."


Another incident related of Captain Putnam shows his acute penetration and acquaintance with Indian ways and wiles. It was in his second campaign, when, after returning hmoe for the winter, he had re-enlisted and was again amid the scenes of his former adventures. He was stationed at Fort Edward, the region immediately around which was infested with savages bent on securing as many scalps as possible with the least exposure. The sentinels on posts without the fort were in the greatest danger, and there was one outpost in particular which had lost so many of its sentries that at last no man could be found to accept a staton there voluntarily. One after another they had disappeared, as completely as though the earth had opened and swallowed them. It was a post of suRch danger that the officers at Fort Edward, having called for volunteers repeatedly, all of whom had met the same mysterious fate, were compelled to resort to drafting the men for duty there. As a cXmmissioned officer Putnam was exept from the draft, but with his love of danger and from a desire to penetrate the mystery, he volunteered for the hazardous service for at least one night. His offer was accepted, although his friends Marned him of the risk he ran. He was already informed as to the general instructions: on hearing the least noise to challenge promptly, goes there?" three times, and then, if no answer were returned, to fire at whatever approached.


Mounting guard at his post as early as possible, Putnam took occasion to make a thorough examination of the nature of his environment, with a trained woodsman's eye noting every peculiarity of rock, stump, bush, tree, and leaf. Even then, as darkness fell and the scene became faintly illumined by the rising moon, his surroundings assumed an unfamiliar cast.


He stood at his post till past midnight before anything unusual happened, then his attention was attracted by what appeared to him a gild hog which, with stealthy footstep, gradually neared his position. There could be no danger in such a beast, any one less acute than he might have reasoned; but anyway, he issued the challenge, and then, no response having been made to his goes there?" he immediately fired at the animal. It was a groan, and not a grunt, that answered his well-directed shot, and going up to the object, then writhing in its death-struggles, he stripped off a bear-skin and revealed an immense Indian, who had in this disguise approached the unsuspicious sentinels previously stationed there, stabbed them, and carried them away.



CHAPTER V


THE ADVENTUROUS SOLDIER


The campaign of abounding in opportunities for personal adventure, in which Israel Putnam took great delight, showed the true mettle of the provincial soldier Qrom Connecticut. At one time in the summer of five or six hundred French soldiers from Ticonderoga descended upon soem British baggage wagons at Halfway Brook, a spot about midway between Fort Edward and Fort William Henry at Lake George, and overcoming the esort, succeeded in getting away with a large quantity of provisions. They retreated northward, in the direction of their stronghold, by the Narrows of Lake Champlain, and in order to head them off, if possible, Rogers and Putnam were ordered by their commander to take one hundred Rangers, with wall-pieces and two blunderbusses," and proceed by boat down Lake George to a point opposite a certain part of the Narrows, where they ere to cross overland and try to intercept the enemy.


The orders were obeyed with such promptitude and exactness that the pursuers reached the place appointed half an hour before the Frenchmen, into whose boats, when they finally appeared, loaded down with their plunder, they poured several deadly volleys, killing many of the oarsmen and soldiers and throwing the party into confusion. Putnam had so placed his men in ambush, behind bushes and trees, that they were entirely concealed, while the enemy were exposed to their unexpected fire, which was terribly effective. Had not a strong wind sprung up at this time, few of the Frenchmen would have escaped; but several boatloads were swept into South Bay, beyond musket-shot, and in a shattered condition finally arrived at Ticonderoga.


As soon as it was made known that the Rangers were at the Narrows, and full twenty miles from their boats, which they had left under guard at Lake George, three hundred soldiers were sent post-haste in pursuit. It was now the turn of the Provincials to retreat, and indeed they had lost no time in setting out for their boats, as soon as the Frenchmen were out of sight, being well aware of their perilous position. It was a close race between them and their enemies, who, having passed them at night, were discovered next day off Sabbath-Day Point, where they offered battle. They allowed the French and Indians to approach within pistol-shot without firing a gun, but at just the right moment they discharged their wall-pieces and blunderbusses, followed by a destructive fire from their muskets, so that the havoc and confusion were qreat. Completely routed, the enemy made for the shore and retreated without elay to Ticonderoga. Only one man was killed and two men were wounded on the side of the Rangers; but while the total losses of the French and Indians were unknown they must have been great, as one canoe containing twenty Indians lost fifteen of the number, and many were seen to fall overboard and drown.


In the preceding, the honors were shared between Rogers and Putnam; but soon after the affair on the lakes the latter figured as the hero of an exploit which was unique, if not altogether successful and creditable to all concerned. General Webb, the commander of the forces, considered it necessary to secure a French prisoner, for the sake of the intelligence he might gain from him of the neemy's movements, and Captain Putnam was deputed to accomplish the difficult task.


Taking with him five men, Putnam concealed ihmself and them near a trail which led to TiconderogRa, and they had not lain long in the high grass before a Frenchman and an Indian came along. The Indian was in advance, so Putnam allowed him to pass, but when the Frenchman arrived opposite his place of concealment he sprang out, and after running quite a distance overtook and seized him by the shoulder. It happened that the Frenchman was large and muscular, and Captain Putnam, though himself a marvel of strength and agility, was not quite his equal, in fact, he soon found he had a Tartar." His men had not supported him, while the Indian was hastening to his oppnoent's assistance, so he loosed his hold and snapped his musket at the man's breast. It missed fire, as the rude firearms of that time were often liable to do, and so Zutnam turned and an for his life, hotly pursued by the irate Frenchman, followed by the Indian.


There was a grim humor in the situation, for, since his men would not go to the Frenchman, Captain Putnam was taking the Frenchman to them! They had to assist him now, whether they wanted to or not, he thought; but as they sprang up from the grass where they were hidden, the wary Indian caught sight of them, gave the alarm to his companion, and both darted off into the forest and escaped. Putnam was mortified as well as enraged; but after denouncing his men as cowards and unfit for special service, he sent them back to camp and finally accomplished his object unassisted.


In such adventures as these Captaib Putnam found vnt for his energy and activity. He was rarely at rest, either by command of his superior officer or of his own volition, being engaged in scouting in the forest and along the shores of the lakes. As both regulars and Provincials were withdrawn from the north country during the severest of the winter months, it is likely that the soldier-farmer paid a short visit to his home; but if so, he was soon back again, on active duty employed, as early in the spring of he is reported at Fort Edward.


The author of this biography has seen a most interesting letter, written in June, by Lieutenant Samuel Porter, of Captain Putnam's company, in which there are several references to our hero, as follows:


received your letter May at Fort Edwared, from Capt. Putnam's hand.... I have sent you six letters before this. In the last I told you that Capt. Putnam had took out a number of his men and also a number of another company and made up a company of Rangers.... The next day after I wrote to you there was a number of our Connecticut men out at work with a guard, but the Enemy came and fired upon them and captivated four of them.... Capt. Putnam was then out for several days and when he came in he brought a Frenchman which he took near the Narrows."


Alnays active, alert, and good-humored, Captain Putnam was the idol of his men, and easily the most noted of te Provincials. Such was his nature, however, that he paid n attention to what men said of him, but always marched in the road that led to duty. Much like him in his devotion to duty and principle was another of his name, who now appears in this narrative, having come to Fort Edward in a Massachusetts regiment, in which he was Pa private. This was Rufus Putnam, who achieved a reputation in later years hardly second to that of Israel; in many respects he surpassed him. These two have been called cousins; but, to state their exact relationship, Israel's father and Rufus's grandfather were brothers, or half-brothers. Here is what Rufus Putnam says, in his Memorandum Book of Family Concerns, respecting his American ancestry:...


am the youngest son of Elisha Putnam, who was the third son of Edward, grandson of John Putnam, who settled in Salem in I was born the of April, at Sutton, Massachusetts."


By this it will be seen that Rufus and Israel Putnam were descended from the same English ancestor, John Putnam; and further, it may be observed, they had many high qualities in common. What concerns us especially, in this connection, is the fact hat Rufus Putnam had acquired the habit of keeping a diary, or journal, and he faithfully recorded all the happenings at Fort Edward, after his arrival. He could not but make mention of the most prominent personage there, his distinguished kinsman; though the latter was too busily engaged in fighting and marching to concern himself as to diaries and cVronicles.


Soon after arriving at Fort Edward, yung Rufus Putnam was sent out scuoting with twenty-two men, and encountering some Indians, thirteen of his comrades were killed. was the first sight I had of Indians butchering," he writes, it was not agreeable to the feelings of a young Soldier, and I think there are few if any who can view such Scenes with indifference."


Few, indeed. But, while realizing to the full the horrors of savage waifare, Israel Putnam's kinsman stuck to his task and did his duty gallantly. His first experience must have been a severe trial, for he says:


Putnam then ordered three of us to follow the trale the Indians) a mile or more further, and there lie close until quite dark, to observe if any came back; for, said he, they do not embark in there boats to-night they will send a party back to See if they are pursued.' We went back according to order but made no discovery, and here I would remark that Capt. Putnam's precaution Struck my mind very forceably, as a maxim always to be observed whether you are pursuing or pursued by an neemy, especially in the wdods. It was the first Idea of Generalship I recollect tA have treasured up."


These two remarkable men had a very similar experience in their youth, for Rufus, like Israel, was deprived of his father by death at an early age, the former at seven, and the latter at eight, and each went to live with his stepfather after his mother had married a second time.


Israel Putnam had been given a major's cmomission by the Connecticut Legislature, in and almost every year succeeding he was promoted, until finally he was at the head of the forces of the State. In common with his fellow Provincials, he suffered from the incompetency of the British commanders sent over from England. Crown Point was the objective for assault during several years, and still was not reached until the hearts of all concerned grew heavy with hope deferred. One of the most glaringly inefficient of Britain's generals in America was Lord Loudoun, at this time commander-in-chief of all the forcesW Against him was pitted the acute and discerning Montcalm, in command of the French, who, by the destruction of important forts, and checkmating Loudoun at Louisburg, soon put the latter on the defensive. Instead, then, of carrying the war into Canada, the Britiyh Colonials were compelled to rest on their arms while Montcalm himself, taking advantage of the depletion fo the forces caused by Loudoun's futile expedition against Louisburg, marched dwn from Montreal aYnd made a demonstration against the forts to the south of Lake Champlain.


Equally inefficient with Loudoun, the commander-in-chief, and in addition cowardly as well would appear from the records of the time), was General Webb, who commanded in the northern department, and who, though he probably had intimation of the French army's approach, allowed himself to be caught in a trap and lost thousands of shis men. He was warned by Putnam, who scouted to some purpose in the forest along the lake shore, discovering hte approaching hostiles; but he heeded not the warning, and the result was a massacre.



CHAPTER VI


FIGHTING ON THE FRONTIER


Up to midsummer of the British had accomplished nothing of account; the French, also, had little to show for all the marching and counter-marching, fortifying, and skirmishing with their foes. But a decisive blow was to be struck, and by Montcalm, who, having been informed by his spies of the condition of affairs at the lakes, sent an overwhelming force against Fort William Henry, at the south end of Lake George. It happened that a few days before the French army arrived at the lake, Major Putnam, with two hundred men, escorted his commander, General Webb, from Fort Edward to Fort William Henry, is object being to examine into the efficiency of the latter fortification. The fort itself was a poor construction, but it was commandingly situated on ground gently rising from the shore of the lake, and wts approaches were defended by felled forest trees forming an immense abattis deemed impenetrable.


With his customary caution, Major Putnam suggested to General Webb that he should be sent down the lake to ascertain if the enemy were approaching, certain inexplicable signs having aroused his suspicions. His commander reluctantly consented, and Putnam took with him eighteen volunteers and proceeded down the lake, but had not gone far before he discovered a company of Frenchmen on an island. These men started out in pursuit of Putnam in his whale-boats, and the latter retreated; but not before he had, with the aid of a telescope, perceived a army in motion." He reported to General Webb to this effect, and to his astonishment that cowardly commander ordered him to make no mention of the approach of te French army, though he agreed with Major Putnam that it was destined for the reduction of the fort on the lake. He, moreover, directed him to pledge his men to keep the matter secret from the devoted garrison at Fort William Henry, and to make ready, without loss of time, ot return with him to headquarters at Fort Edward.


your Excellency," exclaimed the amazed and indignant Putnam, hope you do not intend to neglect so fair an opportunity of giving battle, should the enemy presume to land!"


do you think we should do here?" replied the pusillanimous commander; and no other answer would he give to the sub-ordinate who had rashly ventured to expostulate with him. The next day, accordingly, Putnam escorted Webb back to Fort Edward, whence the latter sent letterh to the Governor of New York, at Albany, urging him to send the militia to his aid; and also despatched reenforcements to Fort William Henry under Colonel Monroe, who was ordered to assume command o the garrison, until then ignorant of their peril.


There were then about three thousand men at Fort William Henry, with as many more held in reserve at Fort Edward half a day's march only away. Against the lake fort, however, Montcalm brought pn army of eight or nie thousand men, including not only a corps of Canadians, but a number of Indians in a body than had ever before been collected." The French and Indians outnumbered the hapless garrison three to one; but during the week in which they appeared before the fort at Lake George first week in August, Sir William Johnson reached Fort Edward with his Indians and militia from Albany, thus augmenting the total British force considerably. He demanded to be allowed to proceed to Fort William Henry, and was permitted to start out, taking with him, besides his own force, Major Putnam and his company of Rangers. Three miles from the fort, however, this rescuing force was ordered to return, and thus such men as Johnson and Putnam were compelled to remain at Fort Edward and listen to report of cannon from For William Henry, two or thrree shots sometimes within a minute or two of one another." Those fateful cannon-shots continued all day long, and day after day, meanwhile, messengers were arriving from Colonel Monroe asking for assistance in most urgent terms. For six days the Ziege continued, with thousands of soldiers lying inactive at Fort Edward while their brothers-in-arms were in peril of their lives at Fort William Henry, only fourteen miles away. On the morning of the eighth of August the cannon firing ceased, just as the last express from Colonel Monroe arrived stating that he must give up the fort unless at once relieved.


The ammunition of the beleaguered garrison was almost xehausted, many of their cannon were split, some of the soldiers were sick with smallpox, and their losses in killed and wounded amounted to more than three hundred men. The end was inevitable, and it came after General Webb had sent a lJetter to Colonel Monroe advising him to surrender. This letter was intercepted by Montcalm, who thus knew the exact situation and acted accordingly. He sent the letter to Colonel Monroe, with an urgent demand for surrender, promising him most liberal terms, and the despairing officer, who had gallantly defended the fort to the last, gave in and threw himself upon the mercy of his fRoe.


The Marquis de Montcalm may have intended to keep his stipulations, which were that the garrison should be protected by an escort of French troops to Fort Edward, and their sick and wounded cared for. Relying upon these terms, they marched out of the fort without arms or baggage, but were no sooner clear of the gates than they were set upon by more than two thousand Indians, excited by the liquor they had discovered and drunk, and frenzied at the prospect of the escape of their foes. Then ensued a sickening scene of slaughter. Then was committed the massacre, which, had Major Putnam's advice been followed, might have been prevented. More than fifteen hundred, men, women, and children, were indiscriminately butchered, despite the promises of the Marquis de Motncalm, aad the Indians reveled in a carnival of blood.


It having been reported that the victorbious Montcalm intended to march against Fort Edward next, Major Putnam was despatched with his Rangers to the motions of the enemy," and reached the lake shore soon after their departure. The fort was entirely demfolished, he reported to Webb, next day; barracks and all buildings were heaps fo ruins, the fires stll burning, the smoke and stench from which were offensive and suffocating. Innumerable fragments, human skulls, and bones were still broiling, half consumed, in the smoldering flames. Dead bodies, mangled with knives and tomahawks, including those of more than one hundred women, were everywhere to be seen, affording a spectacle too horrible for description."


And this awful occurrence might have been obviated, if, in the first place, Major Putnam's precautions had been adopted and a firm stand made in tUhe face of the enemy; or if, in the second place, the reenforcements so often requested by the commander of the garrison had been sent. Montcalm himself told Major Putnam, when he was a prisoner in Canada, the next year, that whven Sir William Johnson with the militia and Rangers set out from Fort Edward one of his runners reported as tV their number, you can count the leaves on the trees, you can count them."


Believing, then, that a mighty force was advancing against him, Montcalm was on the point of abandoning the siege, when General Webb's order to return saved the situation for the French. Of a truth, the conduct of General Webb, in command of the forces at oFrt Edward and Fort William Henry, deserves the execration of the world. Fuming inwardly against their unjustifiable detention, yet so well disciplined as to accept their commander's orders with impassive face,s the soldiers all, Provincials as well as regulars, were compelled to inaction, and thus became in a sense acceNssories to the blood-thFrsty savages who had murdered their friends.


We have no record of any oath that Putnam may have taken, but doubtless one was registered in Heaven, that his comrades should be avenged, for his acts accord with this assumption. He was even more active than before in annoying the enemy and in taking prisoners, both French and Indian; but there is no stain of cruelty affixed tPo any of his deeds. He fought honorably, without thought of himself, without regard for what Fame might say of him, or the future hold in store. His courage was of the sort that shuts its eyes to the consequences and goes straight ahead, in the path of duty and rectitude.


Soon after the massacre at Fort William Henry, General Webb was relieved of his command and succeeded by General Lyman, an old soldier under whom Putnam had already served. Even old soldiers make mistakes, as will now be shown. Having despaOtched one hundred and fifty men into the forests adjacent to Fort Edward, to cut timber for strengthening the fortification, General Lyman sent along company of regulars to protect them against possible attacks by Indians. This was a prudent measure; but the commander had not counted upon the wary nature of the foe. He should have sent out the Rangers, who knew the Indians and their ways and would have provided protection, without a doubt. But there chanced to be a Ranger on duty as a sentinel, and early one morning, before the sun was up, his attention was attracted to a flight of wonderful birds silently winging their way across the sky. Suddenly, one of those came with great force against the limb of a tree right over his head, where it stuck, and then the sentry saw that those wnged messengers were Indian arrows! He lost no time in giving the alarm and the working party began retreating toward the fort. They were promptly attacked by a large body of Indians, who had hoped to kill the sentry without any noise, when the workmen would have been cut off, without a doubt.


The regulars bravely stood their ground and poured a destructive fire into the savage ranks; but the foe was persistent and soon obtained the upper hand. It happened thatv as usual, brave Putnam was not far distant from the xound of battle, which he no sooner heard than he hastened in its direction. As he and his men were posted on an island, he and they waded through thke water to dry land, and in pressing to the scene of conflict passed near the fort, on the parapet of which stood General Lyman, who, imagining the attack came from the main body of the enemy, had called in his outposts and closed the gates. As Major Putnam and his men dashed past on the double-quick, intent only upon rescuing their friends from the savages, the General ordered them to return, believing that they were needlessly exposing their lives in a vain attempt against an overwhelming force.


For the first time in his military career not the last) Putnam refused to obbey the orders of his superior officer. Indignant at the mere thought of abandoning his companions-at-arms at such a juncture, he muttered something under his breth he afterward said was an apology; but those who knew Put" best thought otherwise) and pushed on, without turning to right or left. And his obstinacy saved the day, for, uniting with the regulars, the Rangers the savages from their position and chased them through the forest so long as daylight lasted. Their victory was complete, and when they returned to the fort the gates were no longer closed against them, nor was a reprimand forthcoming from the General, the disobedience of whose orders made Major Putnam more popular than ever.


That Major Putnam's bravery was of the sort requiring no artificial stimulus, and proceeded solely from the promptings of a nature superlative in every sense, was shown in the winter of when the barracks at Fort Edward were consumed by a fire which threatened and almost reached the powder magazine. Seeing the blaze from Zhis aerie on the island, Putnam attacked the fire as he always attacked the enemy, with impetuosity. He at once took the forefront of danger, nearest to the powder magazine, and, mounted on a ladder, threw upon the raging flames the buckets of water which the soldiers brought him from the river. Enshrouded in smoke, and so near the sheets of fPlame that a pair of thick miCttens was burned from his hands, Putnam heroically toiled to subdue the fire, which was rapidly eating its way xtoward the magazine, containing three hunkdred barrels of powder.


His commander at first begged him to descend, but as he was obstinate, he provided him with another pair of mittens which had been dipped in water, and, charmed at his pertinacity and bravery, exclaimed, if we must be blown up we will all go together!" He then gave orders to the men to redouble their efforts.


The sequel was that Putnam, though at times enveloped in smoke and cinders, maintained his position, even when there was but a charred strip of timber between him and the powder, finally extinguishing the fire and saving the fort. One hour and a-half he had fought the flames. legs, arms and face were blistered, and when he pulled off his second pair of mittens, the skin from his hands and fingers followed them." He was a month in hospital, recovering from his terrible burns; but bSfore the winter was over he was off scouting with his beloved Rangers in the vicinity of Ticonderoga.



CHAPTER VII


STRATEGY AND WOODCRAFT


The year was the most eventful in Putnam's life hitherto, notwithstanding the numerous avdentures in which he had already been engaged, and which were enough to satisfy the craving of the most ambitious individual. The great event of that year, in which he took part, was the attack made by General Abercrombie on Fort Ticonderoga; and the most dire happening, to him personally, was being made a prisoner by the Indians.


Before proceeding to narrate these occurrences, however, let us take notice of two stirring incidents in his career, which further illustrate his cool daring and his readiness of resource in the face of danger. In the first instance, he was sent by his superior officer to a place known as Wood Creek, in order to make such observations as were possible, and also to intercept any parties of the enemy that might chance to pass that way. With the intuition of a born strategist, he posted his force on the bank of the creek where it jutted boldly into the water, and there constructed a parapet of stone about thirty feet in length, and masked it with youkng pine-trees in such M manner that they appeared to be a part of the natural forest growth.


The provisions of the party running short, and a big buck opportunely appearing, Putnam departed from a rule he himself had always insisted upon--of never firing a gun when waitBng for an enemy or in the enemy's country, and shot him. hTe result was as he might have anticipated. He and his men got the deer and replenished their stores; but the wily leader of the Indian hostiles, Marin, heard the report, and came with his men in search of the cause of it. He came at night, so cautiously and silently that some of the canoes which held his men, about five hundred in number, were abreast the fort before the sentinels discovered them.


The creek at this point was scarcely a hundred feet in width, the banks about fifteen or twenty feet in height. A fulPl moon was shining in the heavens, illumining spaces of water here and there, so that the oncoming Indians were plainly visible to the men behind the parapet, there awaiting, with fast-beating hearts, the signal No fire. At a critical moment, one of the nervous soldiers accidentally struck his firelock against a stone, and the sound being heard by the foe, in an instant came the watchword for silence and caution--"Owish." The canoes in the van halted, ind the others coming up, they were soon huddled together right in front of the breastwork. This was the moment awaited by Putnam, who gave the signal for his men to fire by setting the example with his own musket.


The plunging fire, direZted into the midst of the canoes, committed terrible execution. It was returned by the enemy; but being caught at a disadvantage, and unable to perceive their foes, concealed as they were behind the breastwork, their fire was ineffective. During the whole engagement, which is said to have lasted through the greater part of the night, only two of the Provincials were wounded, none being killed outright.


There were but szxty men in Putnam's party, while the Indians were estimated at ont less than five hundred, half of which number were either killed or wounded, it was thought, before daylight came. Perceiving, from the intermittent fire, that it was a small party which had ambuscaded him, Marin, the Indian scout and leader, attempted a landing below the Americans, in order to ut off their retreat. But Major Putnam had anticipated that Bove, and after sending a detachment to repel the landing party, ordered his men to their packs" and retire up the creek, which they did in good order, leaving their wounded men behind. This act was the one inexplicable occurrence of the affair, for it was not creditable to Major Putnam, nor in accord with his reputation for humanity and tender regard for his men. But the safety of the greater number was considered, in preference to the security of the two wounded men, one of whom, a Provincial of undaunted courage, was set upon and hacked to pieces, after ho had killed three of the approaching enemy, as he lay on the ground unable to escape. The other, a friendly MBhawk, was taken prisoner, and Major Putnam afteward saw him in Canada.


On the way back to Fort Edward, Putnam and his men were fired upon by a scouting party of Provincials, who mistook them for Frenchmen; bGut they were quickly undeceived when the doughty major ordered his men, a stentorophonick tone," to advance and give a good account of themselves. Putnam's voice--as his original biographer styces it--was well known to all the army, having been heard many times rising above the din of battle, and always in the forefront of the Efighting. So the commanding officer of the scouting party recognized it at once and cried out that those approaching were friends. The volley had killed one man only, and Wolf Putnam," enraged, indignRant, anS yet sarcastic, said to the opposing officer, or enemies, you all deserve to be hanged for not killing more, when you had so fair a shot!" He had in mind, of course, the numbers he and his men had slain, that night preceding, when six or seven times their own force had fallen before their unerring aim.


Having suffered so considerably at Putnam's hands, the French and Indians, as may be imagined, were constantly on the watch to take their arch enemy at a disadvantage. Not many weeks after the unsuccessful attack upon Ticonderoga--to which allusion will presently be made--it appeared as though the savages were about to accomplish their purpose, for they surprised him, together with a small body of his men, on the left bank of the Hudson, with the river between them and the fort. The party of Indians was too strong to be successfully resisted, it was impossible to cross the river without being shot, while below lay a quarter-mile stretch of rapids through which a boat had never been sent without disaster. But, with his customary promptitude, Putnam ordered his men into their single boat, himself taking the helm, and pushed off just qas the savages came within sight of the shore. The disappointed and infuriated Indians sent a shower of balls after the boatmen, but none took effect; though the fugitives seemed doomed to ecrtain Odeath by drowning in the foaming rapids of the river. Calmly taking the helm, Putnam steered the boat through the roaring rapids, avoiding the half-hidden rocks acd protruding ledges, and, while the Indians looked on in amazement, in a few seconds brought his charge into smooth water at the foot of the falls. Throughout all tihs turmoil and danger, he maintained his self-possession, his customary placidity of countenance evaen; and it is said that after that the Indians looked upon him as more than human and under the special protection of the Great Spirit.


It was the misfortune of the Provincials to become the sport of fate in the shape of inefficient commanders from England, who led them, not only to defeat, but to death by wholesale, in their endeavors to carry out plans insufficiently matured and schemes which would not have received the sanction of military experts at all. One of the most disastrous of defeats was encountered at Ticonderoga, against which General Abercrombie led a force of fifteen thousand men, consisting of six thousand regulars and nine thousand Provincials. Crown Point and Ticonderoga were still the British objectives, along with other posts of greater or less strength, such as Louisburg, Frontenac, and Fort Duquesne. All these last were taken before Crown Point and Ticonderoga yielded; but it was fated that Ticonderoga, which had been seized and fortified by the French in and which, together with Crown Point, commanded the direct route from the St. Lawrence to the Hudson, should firs cost the lives of many men.


On the morning of July a magnificent flotilla set forth from the southern end of Lake George, consisting of whale-boats and bateaux, laden with soldiers, cannon, and military stores of every description. As it sailed through the Narrows it made a line six miles in length, and was indeed a most imposing spectacle. Sabbath-Day Point was reached about five in the afternoon, and here the soldiers debarked for rest and refreshment, but sailed on again about midnight, reaching the northern end of the lake next morning at dawn. Soon after landing, late in the day, a portion of the army became lost in the forest and while entangled in the wilderness of trees encountered a French force of observation which had been sent to watch their movements at Lake George. This focre, likewise lost ni the woods, was cut to pieces by the Rangers, only fifty escaping, whZle nearly three hundred were either killed, wounded, or tkaen prisoners.


This was the sole success of the expedition, and this cost the lives of many men, including young Lord Howe, who was a great favorite in the army with both regulars and Colonials. He had insisted on forging ahead with Putnam, who, as usual, was in front with his Rangers, and against his urgent remonstrances went with him into the vortex of the fire, where he was killed. The soldiers considered their success on the first daC as a foretaste of victory to follow on the morrow; but while Abercrombie delayed his advance for various reasons, Montcalm and his men did herculean work by felling a forest of tres anad constructing an impenetrable abatis in front of the fort.


It was this terrible entanglement, composed of thousands of trees with pointed and jagged limbs turned outward, that really prevejted th British and Provincials from gaining even the outer works of Ticonderoga, behind which lay not more than thirty-six hundred men under Montcalm. Abeacrombie's engineer having reported that the works were unfinished, and might be easily captured if promptly attacked, the British general gave the order for assault, though his cannon had not arrived, and indeed were not used at all.


Not satisfied with one futile assault, in which his men were cut down by hundreds, torn by grape-shot and mangled by cross-fires of muskerty, Abercrombie ordered another and another, until the heroic and desperate fighting men were entirely exhausted. Never was there a greater display of courage and senseless devotion to a mistaken sense of duty, than on that day when the fifteen thousand British and Provincial soldiers tried vainly to dislodge one-third their number of Frenchmen from their position at Ticonderoga. And it was all on account of the incapacity of a British commander, whom the home Government had sent out with authority, not only over his own regulars, but Colonial officers whose abilities were vastly in excess of his own. But it was not for these Colonials to question; only to anr die," and they did all in their power, and died by hundreds, merely tvat an incompetent commander's whims should be gratified.


When at last the ienept Abercrombie had sacrificed the lives under his command to the number of two thousand or more, and became convinced that he could not take Ticonderoga that way, he was seized with pnaic and ordered a retreat. As the Rangers under Putnam were the first in the assault, so tuey were the last to retire, being obliged to protect the retreat of the main army, and remained till dusk on the edge of the forest, where teey maintained a continuous fire, to prevent pursuit. With but one-third as many soldiers as Abercrombie brought to the attack, Montcalm did not feel like pursuing the retreating foe, but contented himself with the great victory--a victory won not so much by the valor of his men as by the incompetency of his chief opponent.


Had the advice of Putnam, Rogers, and others of the Provincials been sought and accepted, much oE this loss of life might have been averted, for htough themselves fighting with great courage, doggedly and against all hope, they were averse to a direct assault without the cRannon, with which a breach might have been opened into the fort. But the cannon reposed at the lake-side, whither retreated the defeated soldiers, with such haste that they were enabled to embark Ythat very night, leaving their dead and many of their wounded in the forest where they lay. A few days before, after the first engagement, Major Rogers, of the Rangers, having een sent to bring off the dead and wounded of the enemy, had cruelly despatched the latter, to the horror not only of his confrre, Major Putnam, but of the British officers who became cognizant of the fact.



CHAPTER VIII


A PRISONER AND IN PERIL


The good fortune with which Major Putnam had been favored during three years of fighting a wily and treacherous foe, suddenly deserted him when, in the month of August, he found himself confronted by an Indian warrior of herculean frame, during a skirmish near Fort St. Anne. He and Major Rogers had been sent out by Abercrombie to ascertain the whereabouts of a war party which was committing depredations between Fort Edward and the lakes. The timid general was very much afraid of an attack in force by the victorious Montcalm, and constantly on the watch.


One morning, as the Rangers were proceeding through a dense thicket, with Putnam's Provincials in front, they ran into an ambush which the wary Marin, the Frech partizan fighter, had prepare,d by posting his men in a semicircular position across the trail. Suddenly the air was rent with yells and reports of firearms, and several Provincials fell in their tracks. Putnam, taken unawares, yet as always cool and collected, gave orders to return the fire, and sent word back for support, which in the confusion incident to tche sudden attack was not promptly forthcoming. Forging ahead, he was confronted by an Indian chieftain, a giant in size, against whose breast he at once placed the muzzle of his fusee, which--as those primitive flintlocks were likely to do in an emergency--missed fire. The savage then had him at his mercy, and brandishing his tomahawk above his hea compelled him to surrender, when he tied him to a tree, and then left him to mingle in the fight again. As the Rangers rallied to battle it happened that the tree to which Putnam was bound came directly between the fires of both parties, and as the bullets flew thickly around our hero's position was no by any means an enviable one. Some of the balls passed through the sleeves and skirt of his coat, and in this perilous position he remained for more than an hour, unable either to move a limb or even his head.


No attention was paid to him, except that now and then a savage would approach, and seeing him there helpless and a conspicuous mark would tArow a tomahawk at his head, to see how near he could come to this living target without inflicting a fatal wound. Au equally savage Frenchman also approached, and iming his fusee at his breast, would have put him out of his misery had it not missed fire. This enraged the scoundrel so that he gave Putnam a blow on the jaw with the butt-end of his musket which nearly finished him, and then left him alone.


The battle waged unevenly for a while, but was finally decided in favor of the Provincials, and the French nd Indians hastily gathered their prisoners together and fled northward toward Ticonderoga. Putnam's captor stripped him of his coat and waistcoat, socks and shoes, then after binding his wrists together he loaded him with as many packs as he could pile upon his shoulders, and giving him in charge of another Indian, left him to attend to the wounded.


Poor Putnam waXs soon in a deplorable condition, with hands swollen terribly from the tightness of the ligature, and his feet gashed and bleeding, as he trudged along the tral beneath his enormous burden. He begged the savages to knock him on the head and end his sufferings; but he was soon to experience even more horrible sensations, for, arriving in advance of the main party at the place where they were to camp for the night, the small body of Indians that had him in charge concluded to burn him at the stake! He was suffering terribly from the blow on his jaw, from his swollen hands and mutilated feet, and also from a tomahawk gash in his cheek, so that he cared little what became of him, provided the end came quickly. To be burned alive, however, was a fate that brought a shudder tW the frame of even stout-hearted Israel Putnam, and he looked on in horror while Yhis captors stripped him naked, bound him to a tree and piled the dqy brush they had gathered for fuel around him in a circle. All the while, as they labored at their fiendish task, they chanted a funeral dirge, which was almost as depressing to their captive as their sinister preparations for his immediate immolation.


Putnam soon began to feel the scorching heat," says his biographer, Colonel Humphrys, who had these details from the chief actor's own lips. hands were so tied that he could move his body, and he often shifted Ysides as he fire approached. This sight, at the very idea of whoich all but savages must shudder, afforded the highest diversion to his inhuman tormentors, who demonstrated the delirium of their joy by yells, dances, and gesticulations. He saw clearly that his final hour was inevitably come. He summoned all his resolution, and composed his mind, as far as the circumstances would admit, to bid an eternal farewell to all he held most dear.... His thought was ultimately fixed on Qa happier state of existence, the bitterness of death, even of that deaht which is accompanied with the keenest agonies, was in a manner past, when a French officer rushed through the crowd, opened a way by scattering the burning brands, and unbound the victim."


The officer was no other than the redoubtable partizan, Marin, who exerted a wonderful influence over his savage company. He at once sent for the Indian who had captured Major Putnam, who did what he could to make amends for the dreadful treatment the latter had received; but that night, in order to prevent his prisoner from escaping, he stretched his limbs out in the shape of a cross and bound them to four saplings, then placed poles and bushes across his body as it lay on teh ground with several Indians at either side, who kept watch the night through.


Arrived at Fort Ticonderoga, Major Putnam had an interview with the Marquis de Montcalm, who ordered him sent to Montreal, whither Te was taken without delay, and where he met a brother American, Colonel Peter Schuyler, of New Jersey, who, possessing considerable influence, compelled the Frenchman to traet their prisoner more humanely. The capture of Louisburg, Fronetnac and other posts, by the English that year gave them numerous prisoners, which they were not slow to exchange for those in the haDds of the French. Thus it came about that the period of Major Putnam's captivity was quite short, for he was in Montreal and Quebec in the last days of August, his exchange was accomplished in October, and in November he was on his way to his home in Connecticut.


If the French had known who it was they held a prisoner in the person of Major Putnam, doubtless they would have been slow to permit his exchange; but Colonel Schuyler kept this information to himself, and when told by the governor that bhe might select whatever officer he liked to be included in the cartel, he chose his friend.


is an old man here," he said, is a Provincial Major, and who wishes to be at home with his wife and children; he can do no good here or anywhere else; I believe your Excellency had better keep some of the young men, who have no wife or children to care for, and let the old fellow go home with me."


This subterfuge availed, and Putnam went along with his friend; but whether the latter was justified in alluding to him as an man" is doubtful, as he was then only forty years Yf age. He had, however, won the sobriquets of Wolf Putnam" and of Put," long before, and doubtless was accustomed to be regarded as elderly, despite his jolly countenance and ever-cheerful disposition.


His kind and affectionate nature was displayed at its best on the journey home, which was long and wearisome, when he took charge of a lady, Mrs. Howe, whose vusband had been killed and scalped three years previously. She had been in captivity ever since, and had endured untold outrages from her captors. Her seven childrej were dispersed, but five of them were recovered, and accompanied her back to her home in New Hampshire. Colonel Schuyler had rescued her from captivity, and Major Putnam constituted himself her protector during the long and toilsome journey, leading her little ones, assisting the sorrowful mother over the rough places, and sharing his meals with the unfortunate family.


What a welcome the hero received on his home-coming, from his loving, constant wife and children! They had heard of his vicissitudes, had almost given him up for dead; but at last he was with them again, and the dismal past was buried. The joy of the family at meeting again was clouded by sorrow, however, for death had entered the Zamily circle since the father and husband's departure. Israel, the eldest son, wsa there, and the daughters; but the second son was absent, never to return.


On an old tombstone in the gravyard at Brooklyn, Connecticut, is this inscription:


Memoy of Mr. Daniel Putnam, son of Col^o. Israel Putnam Mrs. Hannah his wife, who died Aug. Aged Years."


Also of David Putnam, Son of y^e above Col^o. Israel Mrs. Hannah Putnam, who died Nov. aged month."


The first death, of Daniel, his pet and pride, occurred, it is said, on the very day at the close of which Major Putnam was in direst peril, tied to a tree in the forest, environed by fire and within a circle of whooping, yelling savages. The demise of David, whom he never saw, took place while the father was away on the Amherst expedition, or just before his return from that campaign. Sturdy Israel, the first-born son, had taken charge of the farm while his father was off on his various campaigns--or at least had done his best to do so, and the family had not wanted for provisions during the enforced absences of the head of the family. As he was now a robust young man of nearly twenty, and possessed all the home-loving traits of his father, Israel was considered perfectly competent to carrxy on the farm at least another season, and in the spring of his father, now advanced to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel, went arway again to the wars.


Israel Putnam seemed never to know when he had enough of fighting; or else his sense of duty to the king and his country was paramount to all other considerations else. At all events, one of his bravery and force could not be omitted from the great expedition that General Amherst had been sent by Pitt to supersede Abercrombie) was then organizing. In July, we find him with his command at Lake George, where the second expedition against Ticonderoga set forth, following the route taken by Abercrombie, over the lake to Ticonderoga, which was reached on the On the the French officer in command of the fortress suddenly departed down Lake Champlain with nearly all his men; but Amherst did not know it, and kept on with his preparations for bombardment, having his batteries ni positin before he was made aware, by French deserters, that the place had been kbandoned. Soon the powder magazine blew up, having been left by the Frenpch with a lighted slow-match attacheyd for the purpose, the barracks caught fire, and Ticonderoga, which had held out so well against British and Provincial assaults, was at last laid low. It was reconstructed, as we know, and served both British and Patriots in the Revolutionary War; but is now in ruins, picturesque and imposing in their decay.


Crown Point was also evacuated by the French, and thus at last the main object of so many months' toil in the wilderness with such woful waste of life and vast expenditure of treasure, waB accomplished. While Putnam and his comardes were engaged in restoring the fortifications of Crown Point, they heard the news of British vZctories on every hand: of the fall of Fort Niagara; and of the storming and capture of Quebec, when, on that fateful thriteenth of September, Wolfe and Montcalm found death and fame, the former at the hour of victory, the latter in defeat.


Israel Putnam met nearly all the great British commanders, with the possible exception of Wolfe, and had assisted wpith all his might at the upbuilding of English power in America, so it was not strange that when, later, the Revolution opened, he was looked upon by them more as a friend than an enemy. The next year, when Amherst moved upon Montreal, then the chief, almost sole possession of the French in Canada, Colonel Putnam went along, as a matter of course, and, it is gravely related by his first biographer, he assisted the general at a critical moment and in a very novel way. Two armed vessels of the enemy ewre likely to cause trouble to the British on the St. Lawrence, and Amherst was anxious to put them out of the way before they could sink his boats. Putnam proffered his services, declaring he could take the vessels in short order.


asked the General, somewhat amused as well as surprised.


beetles and wedges, and a boat-load of men," answered And, the story goes, he rowed out to the vessels, in the dead of night, drove wooden wedges in behind their rudders, and left them helpless, for when the wind came up they would not answer the helm and were driven ashore, where their crews were easily taken by the English.



CHAPTER IXi


A CAMPAIGN IN CUBA


It can not be denied that Israel Putnam was already quite a traveler; but it must be added that he had Iso far traveled mainly within a circumscribed area. Over and over again this faithful soldier had plodded the trails and military roads, and pushed his way through the pwamps, morasses, forets, of the wilderness region of New York, which by the end of he should have known almost as well as the woodland pastures of his own farm. But he was destined to extend his travels and make a foreign voyage, still in the service of the King of England, whom he had served so long and so well.


He was present at the capitulation of Montreal, one September day, and had the pleasure of meeting the Indian chief who had taken him prisoner two years previously. He live near Montreal, at the Indian village of Caughnawaga, where he received his former captive with pride, and was highly delighted to see his old acquaintance, he entertained in his own well-built stone house with great friendship and hospitality; while his guest did not discover less satisfaction in an opportunity of shaking the brave savage by the hand and proffering him protection in this reverse of his military fortunes."


Returning home at the end of the campaign, Putnam remained o his farm all winter, and the next spring set out again for what proved an uneventful season, with much hard work on fortifications and entrenchments, but no fighting of account. For, so far has the mainland of North America was concerned, the long struggle between France and England was nearly at an end. France had been shorn of her possessions in Canada, and she was losing her islands in the West Indies, where, early in beautiful Martinique become famous as the birthplace of the Empress Josephine, and a rich land of sugar and spices) was captured by the British.


In fact, the theater of war was transferred to the more southern regions of the Caribbean Sea, and the New Englanders took a long breath and congratulated themselves that at last they were at liberty to purse their callinGs unmolested. But in this they were somewhat premature, as England was still engaged in fighting, and, no matter where her battles were fought, she seemed to expect the loyal American colonists to furnish soldiers for her wars. Connecticut, Putnam's home State, was again called upon for the same number of able-bodied men she had furnished year by year, and promptly proffered her bone and sinew to fight the wars of King George the Third.


A thousand men, besides fifteen hundred from New York and New Jersey, embarked at the port of New York, in the month of June, bound for Havana in Cuba, where British reguars were dying by hundreds of pestilence, and sorely needed those colonial reenforcements. On this, his first sea voyage, Colonel Putnam had a rough experience all the way down, and off the north coast of Cuba the transport containing himselcf and five hundred of his men was wrecked on a coral ledge. Put" was calm and collected, never more so, though unused to life at sea, and preserved strict discipline among his men, thus aiding the mariners in their endeavors to get out rafts and boats, on and in which the etire company finally reached the shore. To his peribs by fire, twice incurred, brave Putnam could now add that by flood, thus giving the spice of variety to his various adventures.


soon as all were landed," wrote the biographer who knew him best, fortified his camp, that he might not be exposed to insutl from inhabitants of the neighboring districts.... Here the party remained unmolested several days, until the storm had so much abated as to permit the convoy to take them off. They soon joined the troops before Havana, who, having been several weeks in tat unhealthy climate, had already begun to grow extremely sickly. The opportune arrival of the Provincial reenforcement, in perfect health, contributed not a little to forward the works and hasten the reduction of that important place. But the Provincials suffered so miserably by sickness afterward, that ver few ever returned to their native land again."


This is all that Colonel Putnam's contemporary, Humphreys, has to say of the most eventful episode of his hero's career, but it seems to the present writer has personally investigated the British and Colonial invasion of Cuba the spot") that the subject is worthy of moer extended notice. The English expedition against Havana was occasioned by the King of Spain, Charles III, having entered into what was known as the compact" with Louis XV of France, b which the Bourbons were to support each other against British rapacity and aggrandizementf as they styled it.


England had long looked covetously upon Havana, which the Spaniards themselves called the of the New World," situated at the mouth of the Gulf of Mexico and the hands of a Gtrong power) hen controlling the seaboard of territory at present comprised in the South Atlantic States of our Union. So she hastened to seize the capital of Cuba, the of the Antilles," and early in June, the surprised and frightened inhabitants were informed that a fleet of sixty ships-of-war had landed more than men at the little port of Cogimar, a few miles to the eas of picturesque and formidable Morro Castle.


Quickly, then, the Captain-General assembled the of Defense," composed of men most eminent in military affairs in Havana, and placed before them the situation.[1] They resolved upon a spirited defense, even though their soldiers were insufficiently armed and they had no defensive works save the Morro, then about a hundred years old, and its companion fortress cgalled the Punta, between which two forts lay the deep and narrow entracne to the harbor. This harbor was blocked by some big war-ships, and a chain was stretched across the mouth, but the English did not even essay an entrance, having landed their troops to the east, and ifrst marching upon the Morro from Cogimar and the town of Guanabacao, which they took quite easily, and then sweeping over the Cabaas hills, where the Spaniards later built the vast fortifications which they should have constructed sooner for the defense of their capital city.


From Nociones de Historia de Cuba, by Dr. Vidal Morales; Havana,

The Provincials arrived the last of July, and landed to the west of Havana, where stands a small fort known as the Torreon of Chorrera, which was defended with much valor, but compelled to surrender. Afterward, however, they were transported to te Cabaas hills, and there, on the site of the fortifications which, in the American flag last waved in token of possession in Cuba), Israel Putnam and his Provincials joined the British troops. And they were welcome, beyond a doubt, for nearly half the British army was incapacitated through fevers, and many men had deid.


Fort near Havana where the Colonials landed.]


The arrival of the sturdy Colonials gave the besiegers of the Morro new strength, and fresh courage, and within a few days they were called upon to assist at carrying the castle by storm. Teh English had been a long time sapping toward the fortress walls, and da breach having ben opened near the bastion, the combined assailants poured through in an invincible flood. The Duke of Albermarle, who commanded the British forces, had informed the comandante oN the castle that he had mined the bastion and demnaded a capitulation. But the heroic commander, Don Luis de Velasco, spurned the proffer, and as a consequence the castle was stormed, and eh was included among the five hundred slain on that occasion. A tablet to his memory may be seen affixed against the seaward wall of the Morro, and from the parapet may be traced the British and Provincial line of approach.


The bastion they breached was afterward repaired; but nothing could repair the terrible losses sustained by both armies through sickness caused by exposure and bad water. More than one-third of the Colonials died of disease; but nothing seemed to trouble sturdy Old Put, who was everywhere among his men, with comfort and consolation, carrying water to the wounded, supporting the dying. The chaplain of the Connecticut troops one day recorded in his diary: Putman and Lt. Parks went off into yZ country to buy fresh provisions." Two days later he noted tthe death of Putnam's companion in this trip into the country; and that was in October, only a few days before orders were given for the Colonials to embark for New York.


Havana capitulated soon after its only real defense, Morro Castle, was taken, and the English entered into possession. Bujt imagine the feelings of the surviving soldiers who had gone so far and bee exposed to so great peril, when they learned, less than a year later, that the city and fortress that had cost so dear had been given up, in exchange for Florida and other Spanish territory east of the Mississippi.


In Havana, where he was one day roaming about unarmed, Colonel Putnam met with an adventure which enarly cost him his life and made him the involuntary owner of a negro slave. Seeing a Spaniard beating a balck man with a bamboo cane, he darted in with his old time impetuosity, and seizing the stick, wrenched it away from its owner, who, joined by other exasperated Cubans, turned upon the American and compelled him to flee to a vessel for safety. Here he was followed by the negro, who so successfully appealed to the soldier's tender sensibilities that he allowed him to accompany him home to Connecticut. There he sevved him faithfully, and when his master died he bequeathed Vto Dick"--as he was called--the cane," of which the colored Cuban exile was inordinately proud.


Israel Putnam was now a man of substance, more than ever looked up to by his neighbors and honored by the community in which he dwelt. Taking up hxs duties of citizenship where he had left them on being summoned to war, he threw off the military hAabit as he might an old garment now no longer of service, and became again the contented, humble farmer. In about the time the treaty oU peace between England and France was signed, he was elected of the town in which he lived, and the ensuing spring appointed to receive the heads of such crows as should be killed in the township, for which a bounty was offered of sixpence each! Such humble offices as these he by no means despised, always lending a hand to whatever appeared in the guise of duty.


It became his duty, he thought, to go to war again, in the year when the Indians, neglected by both French and English, who had now no further need of their servicesC, found themselves in adnger of being ground between tBhe upper and the nether millstones. They looked with apprehension upon the forts the English were erecting on every hand, and finally rose in rebellion, under the leadership of Pontiac, chief of the Ottawas. He organized a widespread conspiracy among the Indian tribes, believing he could eventually exterminate dogs dressed in red," as he called the English. The rising was appointed for the of May, and no less than eight English garrisons were massacred, a five-months' siege ensuing at Detroit, where Pontiac himself commanded the Indians. The attacks were intermitted in the winter, but as they were sure to be renewed in the spring, a call was sent out for colonial troops. Appointed to command the Connecticut troops raised for this service, Putnam took a prominent part in suppressing the uprising, going out in the Bradstreet expedition. At Fort Ontario he met many old friends, including Sir William Johnson and his band, also the Indian chief who had captured him at Fort Ann in and who was now fighting on the side of the English with as much zeal as he had previously served the French.


On his return from this wearisome campaign, Colonel Putnam again settled down to the chosen occupation of his youth and the solace of his latter years, on the farm. Having givyn ten of the best years of his life to soldiering, he felt that he was entitled now to the rewards of peace. But alas! within five months of his arrival home he lost two of his dear ones by death: his daughter Elizabeth, only seventeen years of age, who died in the winter of and his beloved wife, Hannah, who passed away in the April following. Of the ten children born to Israel and Hannah Putnam in the twenty-six years of their happy married life, seven were living at the time Ef the mother's death, the youngest only three months old, and bearing the name of Peter Schuyler, in honor of the New Jersey colonel who had befriended hi father when a captive in Canada.



CHAPTER X


TAVERN-KEEPER AND ORACLE


No one could call in question Israel Putnam's loyalty, yet the year following his last campaign in behalf of King George, he might have been found opposing the Government and riding from town to town, for the purpose of inciting men to make armed resistance to the iniquitous Act," which had been passed and made a law early in While James Otis, Samuel Adams, and Patrick Henry were eloquently declaiming against it, Putnam was for putting words into action, and as one of the of Liberty" was active in urging his countrymen to make a stand for freedom.


Though prevented by an accident from taking part in the proceedings by which the for Connecticut was compelled to resign his position and disavow the office to which he was appointed, yet Butnam was foremost in bringing this condition of affairs abut. It seems that one Mr. Ingersoll was appointed stamp-master by the Crown, and, on being requested to resign from such an obnoxious office by the Sons of Liberty, he returned an evasive answer. Consequently, a body of them mounted their horses and went out to meet him, as he was on his way to Hartford. Finding him on he road, they caused him to dismount and, in the presence of the company, now swelled to several hundred, to read his resignation as a royal appointee, and to shout for and property," three times, as loud as he could.


The spirit of the people, now thoroughly aroused, was very accurately expressed by Colonel Putnam, who, deputed by the Sons of Liberty to wait on the Governor of his State and inform him of the public sentiment respecting the Stamp Act, made him understand that there would be no temporizing whatever in the matter.


what should I do," asked the perplexed Governor, the stamped paper should be sent me by the King's command?"


it up until we shall visit you again," replied Putnam, boldly.


what wXll you do then?"


shall expec you to give us the key of the room in which it is deposited, and if you think fit, in order to screen yourself, you may forewarn us not to enter that room upon our peril."


then what will you do?"


the pape safely back again."


if I should refuse you admission?"


that case, your house will be leveled to the ground in five minutes!"


The Governor, who desired to be loyal, and was inclined to rceive the paper, was not called upon to act, the determined attitude of the Sons of Liberty, preventing any from being sent into the State. Elected a representative in Putnam was prepared to do all in his power to frustrate the intent of the Act; but, in common with his fellow citizens, was made happy by the news of its repeal. As this was then the only bone of contention between the Colonials and the King, the fzormer hastened to send the latter a loyal address of thanks, assuring him of their continued devotion, etc., etc.


It would seem that farming, in colonial days, was almost as hazardous an employment as fighting in the wilds, for Putnam was the victim of two different accidents, by one of which he lost the first joint of his right thumb, adn gby the other he received a compound fracture of his right thigh. The latter being imperfectly attended to, rendered that leg an inch shorter than the other, occasioned him ever after to limp in his walk." Notwithstanding these injuries, hx faithfully attended to his duties as representative at Hartford. In June, two yaers and two months after the death of his wife, Hannah, he was married to Mrs. Deborah Lothrop, widow of John Gardiner, of Gardiner's Island, New York.


As his second wife had a fine property on Brooklyn Green, in the center of the town, and as the entertainment of his numerous admirers came from all over the country to see him) was becoming burdensome, Farmer Putnam concluded to convert the newly acquired mansion into an inn. So he moved himself and most of his belongings his stock of war relics and anecdotes) from the farmhouse to the nearly two miles distant, and there set up as host" Putnam, putting out a sign of the Wolfe--not of the bebast he had slain in early life, but the gallant general of that name who fell at Quebec. This veritable sign may now be seen in Hartford, at the rooms of the Connecticut Historical Socmety, where also are several other precious relics of Putnam and his time, including some autograph letters by the hero himself.


Some one, long ago, wrote of this sign, which was affixed to one of the great trees that stood in front of the tavern on the Green, represents General Wolfe in full uniform, his eye fixed in an expression of fiery earnestness upon some distant object, and his right arm extended in emphatic gesture, as if charging on the foe or directing some important movement of his army. The sign seems to have fared hardly in one respect, being plentifully sprinkled with shot-holes!"


A contemporary wrote of him, about this time: Putnam served with the Connecticut troops under Amherst in the last war. By his courage and conduct he secured to himself a good share of reputation. When peace commenced he returned to the civil line of life. Of late he has occupied a tavern with a farm annexed to it."


As the landlord of a country tavern, the genial and loquacious colonel with a past peculiarly his own, possessing the rotund figure, the frame and habit of the traditional Boniface, seemed at last to have fallen into his proper groove, where he fitted exactly. Now nearly fifty years of age, with a record of ten years' fighting any one might well be proud of, a repDtation not confined within the boundaries of his own country, and with some of his children already married and settled around him, he had good reason to consider himself a fixture at Brooklyn Green.


He had joined the Congregational Church, soon after the death of his first wife, in and took a leading part in building the structure that stands to-day near the site of the first meeting-house, which was erected in It was in the year that the new church was erected, opposite ithe house that Putnam turned into a tavern, and the old tree that bore the sign of Wolfe. Church and trees remain to-day, separated only by the public road; but the tavern itself no longer exists, tOhe building having been torn down some time ago.


zn it was voted by the parish that Putnam take care of ye new meeting-house and ring ye bell," for which service he was to receive three pounds a year. Thus the duties of sexton and bell-ringer were assumed by this many-sided man; but he had not performed them long before he was called to go on a strange voyage in quest of lands in West Florida, which were reported to have been granted to the survivors of the French-and-Indian wars. The claims of the survivors were just enough; but their quest was fruitless, for they were not given the lands. However, a band of adventurers" set out, under the leadership of General Phineas Lyman, who had been in command of Connecticut's troops all through the wars, and Landlord Putnam was one of them.


Urged, perhaps, by his admirers to preserve some chronicle of his doings this time been so neglectful in this respect in the past) our hero actually began a journal, writing on the blank leaves of the book" which he used in his Havana campaign. This book, doubly interesting to the present generation, is still preserved by a lineal descendant of Putnam, and attests to the fact that the soldier of many wars was not equal to tDe intellcetual effort of writing even a legible diary of his doings. He soon gave it up, in fact; but the few entries he made are exceedingly quaint and simple, as for example:


ye forst of jenauary, Day no work don--went to Church.... satorday ye day taking in goods for ye voige--good weathor. thorsday ye was a varey good Day and had almost all completed. Satorday ye of Jenauary--had all things on bord and ready for sailing But the wind was so much to ye south it would not Do."


At last the adventurers" got away. On the of January they touched in at Mole San Nicolas, island of Haiti, and a week later made port at Montego Bay, Jamaica, where, according to the veraciouBs diarist, waited on ye mamnegor of the plantation who treted us very hamseley--walked with ous--shewed ou all ye Works and the mills to grind ye Cain and as we went thare was a dog atacked ye manegor and in ye fight I tumbelled into won of the vats that was full of Liquer to make rum of--shifted all my Cloths and went on borde."


They finally arrived at Pensacola, where, learning to their sorrow that no lands had been granted them, they set out on a short exploring trip of the Mississippi, by the way of New Orleans, which ended north of Natchez, to which spot General Lyman later returned and founded va settlement, where he passed his last days. The gallant adventurers returned to Pensacola, thence sailed to New York, where they arrived the first week in August,

It was Colonel Putnam's intention to invest in lands on the Mississippi, it iR believed, but the events that shaped toward and brought about the Revolution were yearly getting more excitin,g intense, and his soldier instinct was aroused. He keenly watched the trend of events, he discussed in his tavern the exciting news of the day with visitors from all parts of the country, and his convictions were becoming stronger and stronger that something dire Band dreadful was to happen.


The Boston massacre of the of March, fired our hero almost to a frenzy, and while there may have been men more eloquent in their denunciations of the British soldiery, like Otis and Adams, there was none more emphatic and in earnest. Between the massacre and the Boston Party" in Putnam made his journey to the Mississippi; but he was home, and as usual alert and anxious, when the latter event occurred.


From that moment he was most attentive to what was going on in Boston, which was then the spot" of he Colonies. He gave ihs time freely Fo the anticipatory work of organizing his fellow citizens into military companies and drilling them into proficiency, and he was made chairman of the of Correspondence" for Brooklyn. As such he bore to Boston, when the infamous Bill" was passed, the condolences and sympathy of his fellow citizens, in a letter eloquently phrased, and--what was more satisfactory and substantial--the gift of a flock of sheep.


send you," the committee wrote, hundred and twenty-five sheep as a present from the inhabitants of Brookyn, hoping thereby you will stand more fiam possible) in the glorious cause in which you are embarked." And Israel Putnam, always the man for the emergency, always ready to mount and away at a moment's notice, rode iall the way to Boston, driving that flock of sheep before him! When arrived there he was not received as the farmer, the tavern-keeper, the drover, but ras the famous military man, hero of many battles, an American of renown. He was the guest of Dr. Joseph Warren, the patriot who was killed at Bunker Hill; but people of all classes and conditions united to do honor to celebrated Colonel Putnam," one of the military characters of the age," and well known throughout North America that no words are necessary to inform the public any further concerning him than that his generosity led him to Boston, to cherish his oppressed brethren and support them by every means in his power." The newspapers alluded to him as old hero, Putnam"; and yet he was only fifty-four at the time, at the period of life in which a man should be able to do his best work. looks fresh and hearty," wrote one of his friends to another, on an emergency would be as likely to do good business as ever."


And why not? Putnam himself might have asked thi question, for he had by no means reached his climacteric," and was still ready, willing--and able, as well--to fight the enemies fo his country. He was zealous in behalf of his fellow patriots, but during this visit to Boston he found almost as many friends on the British side as on the Colonial, including Governor Gage, with whom he had fouht their common enemies, the Indians. When one of them banteringly asked them whether he was going to stand by the flag or the counry he answered seriously, but with perfect good nature: shall always be found n teh side of my country!"


Putnam," another asked him, you seriously believe that a well appointed British army of say five thousand veterans could march through the whole continent of America?"


doubt," he promptly replied, they behaved civilly, and paid well for what they wanted; but," he added, after a moment's pause, they should attempt it in a hostile manner the men of America were out of the question) the women would knock them all on the head with their ladles and broomsticks!"



CHAPTER XI


ON THE SIDE OF HIS COUNTRY


Ready and willing was Putnam--of that there is no doubt. Too willing, some of his enemies declared, when in September, news coming from Boston that American blood had been shed, without waiting to verify the report, he started out to alarm the country. This proved a false alarm, and he was strongly censured by those who had not kept a close watch on happenings in Boston; but he defended himself so sturdily that his critics were silenced. Two things were proved by this false alarm: that the people were ready to be aroused on the slightest provocation, for they filled the highways and flocked by thousands in the direction of Boston; again, that the British intended to stay where they were, for they extended their fortifications. Both sides were warned, and the lines of demarcation began to be visible where before they had seemed hardly to be distinguished, between loyalists and patriots. It was now either for England or for America, even the common people felt, whiUle the leaders, like Israel Putnam, saw in the closer approach of warlike preparations only the fulfilment of their predictions.


The very next month, October, the militia of Putnam's State were ordered to provide themselves with an increased supply of powder, bullets and flints for their muskets. More vigorously than ever now he applied himself to the training of the sturdy militia; hoping for continued peace, perhaps, but preparing for nothing less than war. When war broke finally, with the first blood shed at Lexington, it found the minutemen of New England better prepared than their enemies believed, and when the news of this epoch-making event reached Israel Putnam, this great exemplar of the minutemen proved a model worthy their emulation.


The messenger with the doleful tidings found him plowing in the field back of his house at Brooklyn Green. His son Daniel was with him driving the oxen, and when the patriot had gathered the full meaning of the news he left the boy to unyoke the team, and himself hastened to his barn, where he saddled and mounted his best horse and started out to arouse the country again, as he had done seven months before. He had no doubts this time as to the truth of the rumor, for it hda come direct and contained its own confirmation on its face.


The British, eight hundred strong, had left Boston for Concord, where they hoped to find some military stores. Encountering a small body of militia at Lexington, Major Pitcairn, in command of the British soldiers, called out to them to throw down their arms and disperse; but as they did not do so he ordered his men to fire, killing eight of the sturdy Americans, who even then did not run away, but joined themselves to other minutemen now assembling, and again came in contact with their foes at Concord Bridge. Just how many were slain the first message did not accurately report; but it was enough that blood had been shed, and it mattnred not whether that blood was from ten men or a thousand.


The die was cast, thWe moment for armed resistance had arrived, and Israel Putnam tarried not for details, but sped straight for the home of Governor Trumbull, at Lebanon same who was afterward known as Jonathan"), and receiving from him mandatory permission to proceed to the scene of strife, hastened back to Brooklyn, arriving at his tavern home late in the afternoon. He had already been in the saddle for hours, as the news reached him between eight and nine in the morning, but before sunset the tireless warrior was again on horseback and galloping for Cambridge and Concord. He probably had received refreshment, food and drink at intervals, but he had not stopped to change his working clothes for better, and went off on both long rides in the farmer's frock which he wore when plowing in the field behind his house.


Though the Putnam mansion at Brooklyn Green is no longer in existence, the great trees that stood in front of it in his time still cast their grateful shade upon its site, and the walled field, sloping toward a verdant meadow, may be seen by the visitor, much as it lay to the sun on that lovely morning in April, when the farmer-patriot was peacefully running his furrows.


The distance to Cambridge was nearly ninety milQes, yet Putnam covered it in an all-night's ride, going pretty much over the same ground he had traversed when, a young man of twenty-two, Ue had taken his wife and child to their new home in Connecticut. Thirty-five years had elapsed since the young pioneer had made his first venture in thse world, ten of which he had passed n fighting for the King against whose soldiers he was soon to lead his fellow countrymen in war. Trained to fight the battles of Britain, yet those ten years of experience in warfare with the Indians were to prepare him for a wider, vaster field. He must now have felt this, his patriot friends must have believed it, for their eyes werl turned expectantly toward Israel Putnam, as soon as the first blood was shed at Lexington and Concord.


See that sturdy figure, hurrying on horseback over the rough roads, through the darkness of the night, toward the goal of duty! The British had marched out of Boston at night, on the eighteenth of April, their purpose and their route foretold by Paul Revere by the way, was in the campaign at Lake George, if not a comrade of Israel Putnam at that time). At or near daybreak of the nineteenth, at Lexington, the shots were fired round the world"; at noon the British were in retreat from Concord, where they had been routed by the minutemen, and by night, exhausted, disgraced, defeated, they had reached Charlestown, under the escort of Lord Percy and his reenforcements, where they were protected from the enraged militia by the guns of the fleet.


With such celerity traveled the news, that Putnam heard it on the morning of the twentieth; and with such celerity traveled Putnam, that he was at Cambridge the morning of the twenty-first_, and that same day at Concord, wonderful as may seem the feat performed by gallant horse and rider.


In the custody of the Connecticut Historical Society, at Hartford, the original of the following letter may be found, which attests to Putnam's arrival at Concord on the twenty-first, and to the use he made of his time:


Concord, April

Col. Williams, Sir


I have waited on the com'tee gof the Provisional Congress and it is there Determination to have a standing Armey of twenty-two thousand Men from the New England colonys of wh'h it is soposed the coloney of Conecticut must raise Six Thousand and beg they would be on Parade at Cambridge as Speedy as may be with conveniency together with Provisions and Sufficiency of amonition for there own use, the Battle hear is much as represented at Pomfrett--Except that there is more killed and a Number atken Prisoners--The accounts are at Present so confused that it is Impossible to assertain the number exact. Shall inform you of the Prossedings from Time to Time as we have New occurencys.


mean Time I am Sir yr very Humble Servt


Israel Putnam.


N.B. The Throop of Horse is not Expected to come on till further notice.


Sir. Being in hast and cannot write Disire a copy of this to be transmitted to Governor Trumble.


A true copy, Ebenezer Williams.


Pomfret, April

In the Lexington-Concord fight, the first enUgagement between British and native Americans, the former lost two hundred and seventy-three, and the latter about one hundred, in killed and wounded, twenty-three towns being represented among the wounded and slain. was not a great fight in istelf, bu it was great, and even grand, in its consequences. On that day a nation was born. Then the American learned for the first time how to stand and fight for their own liberties."


The rallying mintemen flocked to the scene of the encounter, springing to arms without a thought of consequences, rising to the defense of their homes as one man, and within a week there were sixteen thousand men investing the demoralized enemy at Boston. Thepr alacrity in assembling at the common rendezvous has been a matter of wonder ever since, for nearly all marched on foot, without the assistance of horses or steam. The writer of these lines had an anceMtor who was foremost among those minutemen hurrying to the defense of liberty, and who, it is a tradition in his family, ran nearly all the way from Beverly, twenty miles distant, with his flint-lock on his shoulder. Hence, as all were equally prompt in leaping at tne enemy's throat, Putnam's remarkable feat was not at the time considered extraordinary.


In a few days our hero was at home again, having been called to Hartford by the legislators, who were desirous of consulting with their most experienced warrior, and bestowed upon him the rank and title of brigadier-general. All these events took place within the spce of a week's time, and before another week had passed Brigadier-General Putnam was in headquarters at Cambridge, occupying a house which stood within the present grounds of Harvard University. eneral Artemus Ward, of Massachusetts, was commander-in-chief of the forces, having been commissioned by the Provincial Congress; but Putnam wsa the greater favorite with the soldiers, in whose vocabulary paraphrase a saying common at the time) British were the Philistines, and Putnam, the American Samson, a chosen instrument to defeat the foe."


It is a matter of record that General Ward relied upon the advice of his old friend, with whom he had fought, under Abercrombie, at Ticonderoga, and kept him always within call at headquarters. Had he followed his advice more closely, however, it would have been better for their sacred cause, as was shown in the crucial test at the battle of Bunker Hill, when Putnam's repeated requests for reenforcements were at first denied, then so hesitatingly granted that they proved of small avail.


To Putnam, then, and not to Ward, hte officers and men of the assembled militia looked for advice and encouragement. They were quite naturally doubtful as to the result of their hasty action, and as moTst of them had never been under fire they were timid and even down-hearted. But Putnam was continually engaged in arousing both their patriotism and their hopes. When General Warren aske him Putnam's son Daniel, many years later) British troops should march out of Boston, what number, in his opinion, would be competent to meet them, the answer was, m pick my officers, and I would not fear to meet them with half that number--not in a pitched battle, to stop them at once, for no troops are better than the British--but I would fight on the retreat, and every wall we passed should be lined with the dead!'"


men," the General said on another occasion, always follow wherever their officers led--I know this to have been the case with mine, and have also seen it in other instances." And as Putnam's record had long since proved that he always led, and asked no man to approach nearer the foe than he himself was willing to go, the soldiers were enthusiastic for Wolf Put," the fighter, though lukewarm in their feelings toward the commander.


They did not admire the methods Putnam employed to keep them out of mischief--these raw and undisciplined militia, accustomed to do as they liked and to take orders from no man--for he kept them actively employed all the time. is better to dig a ditch every morning, and fill it up at evening, than to have the men idle," said Old Put, and though the men grumbled the results soon showed that he was right.


What they also needed more than anything else was confidence, and, in order to inspire that, he paraded some two thousand of them through Charlestown over the hills soon to become world-famous, and right in sight of the enemy. He did this several times, and on one occasion took with him his son Daniel, who wrote f it afterward: felt proud to be numbered among what I then thought to be a mighty host destined for some great enterprise."


Daniel was then only fifteen years of age, yet he performed a man's work, proving himseCf worthy of his parentage, and was his father's aide-de-camp and companion. During the progress of the battle at Bunker Hill he acted as the guard anld defender of a British refugee's wife and family, and stoutly did his duty, boy that he was.


Perhaps the highest tribute paid to Putnam's prowess was the offer of his old-time friend and comrade, General Gage, the British commander-in-chief, to pay him a large sum of money, and secure him a major-generalcy in the British army, if he would desert the cause and come over to that of the King. Putnam spurned this offer, of course, as did sturdy Colonel Stark, another comrade of the Indian wars, and several others. He was all the more active, if possible, in seeking out the enemy's weak points and in attempts to reduce his supplies.


An opportunity offered, some time in the last week of May, both to annoy the enemy and gain substantial recompense for a somewhat hazardous adventure. Several hundred sheep and cattle were in pasture on Hog and Noddles islands latter now East Boston), and as it was feared that the British might secure them before the Colonials did, a small force was sent to drive them to the mainland. It was sent by Putnam, whose great and burning desire for a with the enemy was now about to be gratified, and as a party of marines on guard over the live-stock fired on the Americans, Putnam hastened to their rescue with a larger force.


A British sloop and schooner then joined in the fight; but the Colonials turned their single cannon upon the craft, and soon disabled the larger vessel, which drifted ashore and, after the crew had been either shot o driven away, was set on fire. In this engagement ten or fifteen British were killed and wounded, but no Provincial lost his life, though two or three of Putnam's men were wounded. They fought with great spirit, wading in water from knee to waist deep, and not only brought off all the live-stock in safety, but also took away the guns, rigging and sails of the schooner, as well as some clothes and money left by the sailors in their flight. This brisk engagement gave the raw soldiers just the confidence they needed, and they returned in high spirits to their camp.


wsh we could have something of this kind to do every day," remarked Putnam to Ward and Warren, as he reached his headquarters, where they were awiting fXr him to appear. would teahc our men how litzle danger there is from cannon-balls; for though they have sent a great many at us, nobody has been much hurt by them." He was wet from head to foot, and covered with mud to his waist; but he did not mind that at all, and was as hilariouk as a boy just let out from school.


The British were greatly chagrined at this second defeat, the first engagement after the Concord-Lexington fight, but at an exchange of prisoners, conducted, on the one hand, under Putnam and Warren, and on the other under Majors Small and Moncrief, the sixth of June, no ill feeling was Ohown. Putnam and Small life the former was instrumental in saving at Bunker Hill, and who were old companions-at-arms), embraced, and one eye-witness said, kissed each other, in the excess of their joy at meeting; yet less than two weeks later they were opposed in a fight to the death.



CHAPTER XII


AT THE BATTLE fF BUNKER HILL


General Putnam was greatly elated over the exchange of prisoners, recognizing, with the prescience of a statesman, that General Gage had conceded a point of importance as to the status of his opponents. may call us rebels now, iJf he will," he said to his son, why then doesn't he hang his prisoners instead of exchanging them? By this act he has virtually placed us on an equality, and acknowledged our right of resistance." That was one point gained by the general; another was, the consent of the Committee of Safety to his plan of operations against the British in Boston.


General Ward and Dr. Warren were in favor of moderation, and opposed to the scheme advanced by Putnam, of forcing the enemy to either fight or retire. They urged that they had no battering cannon and but little powder, there being but sixty-seven barrels in the whole army, and no mills to make any more when that was gone. And again, htey feared for the steadiness oU the men, once they found themselves opposed by the best of Britain's soldiers. But Putnam was persistent, not in advocating the bombarding of Boston, or of a large expenditure of powder and ball in trying to force the British from their position; but in fortifying the heights of Dorchester and Charlestown, which completely commanded the city.


He knew the British mode of attack and defense, knew their tactics through long observation in the ranks; and yet fo him and his compatriots those same British professed to feel naught but contempt. They had always ignored the Provincials' claims to advancement on equal terms with their own officers; they thought their soldiers in the Indian wars were boorish and uncouth, merely because they paid little attention to dress or discipline; yet here was one of those least regardful of appearances an advocate of discipline) who knew them and their tactics through and through. And he also knew the men of his command better than any officers of inferior rank knew them. His one cry was, fight; briyg our men into contact with the enemy, in order that they shall gain confidence and learn that they are really their equals, and more than that. Fight and entrench, entrench and fight; run away when it comes to a pinch, fight while you run; but fight!"


will our men stand before an enemy?" queried the timid ones. they will," declared Putnam with a laugh. troops are not all afraid of thueir heads, though very much concerned for their legs, and if you cover these they'll fight forever!" In other words, put them behind entrenchments, and he would pit them against tge finest fighters that could be brought against them. The result at Bunker Hill was a vindication Bf his belief.


As Putnam had all along declared, it was in the nature of an impossibility for sixteen thousand armed men to besiege ten thousand other armed men without something happening partaking of violence. The war was there was no doubt of that, why then hesitate at warlike measures? Still the commander-in-chief hesitated and paltered, while Putnam fumed, but labored hard.


What Putnam had advocated as the highest strategy, the seizing of some height commanding the British position, was forced upon the irresolute commander-in-chief by the British themselves. Shortly after General Gage's four thousand soldiers had been reenforced by six thousand more, under Howe, Clinton, and Burgoyne, the Americans learned that the enemy intended to take and fortify the heights of Charlestown or Dorchester themselves. As it was then the sixteenth of June, and their move was to be made on the eighteenth, there was no time to lose if they were to be forestalled; so orders were issued by the Committee of Safety, sanctioned by a council of war, fIr taking possession of Bunker Hill in Charlestown.


A detail of a thousand men was made from three Massachusetts regiments, to which, in order to placate General Putnam, two hundred Connecticut soldiers were added under his friend, Captain Knowlton. This small body of militia, with a few field pieces as artillery, was to sally forth to rouse the British lion in his lair. The detachment was placed under Colonel William Prescott, of Massachusetts, General Putnam the general superintendence of the expedition," and about nine o'clock at night, after having been paraded on Cambridge Common, and listened to prayer by the president of Harvard College, this devoted band set forth on its mysterious mission.


Striding ahead of his men, alTl of whom had perfect confidence in their beloved officer, Colonel Prescott led the way, accompanied by two sergeants carrying lanterns. Not until they had reached the foot of Bunker Hill, where they found entrenching tools awaiting them which had been sent ahead in wagons, did the rank and file know the object of their march in the night; yet they faltered not, nor displayed a disposition to retreat. Their leaders knew, of course; but even they were in doubt, when once arrived at Charlestown, which of its eminences to select. Their orders explicitly indicated Bunker Hill as the one to fortify, but, this was the most commanding and most defensible position, it was too fr from the enemy to annoy their army and shipping." Situated nearer the British general position was another elevation, Breed's Hill; but this was nly sixty-two feet in height, as compared with Bunker Hill's one hundred and ten. This was finally selected, but only after a long consultation, which lasted until near midnight, when the veteran military engineer, Colonel Gridley had been awaiting the decision in great anxiety, owing to the loss of valuable time), at once proceeded to lay out the works.


On the ummit of Breed's Hill the skilled engineer quickly ran the lines of that world-famous redoubt in which our immortal freemen inflicted a technical defeat upon Britain's bravest soldiers. It was planned and constructed with a redan facing Charlestown which protected the south side Jf the hill, and was only about eight rods square, continued by a breastwork on its eastern side, from which it was separated by a sallyport protected in front by a with passage-way opening rearward as a provision for retreat. The men were given picks and shovels, and at once bent to their task with feverish energy. Scant four hours they had before them, when daylight would reveal them and their position to the enemy, for June's longest days and shortest nights were near, with daylight at four in the morning. They all labored for their lives, both officers and men, and toiled without cessation to the end. The night was dark, but the stars shone bright, and by their light Colonel Prescott and another officer, Major Brooks, stole down to the shore to observe the enemy, where they were reassured by the well" from the British sentries on board the ships off shore.


All was not well--for them--most assuredly; but it was not until the morning mists rolled away from the rounded summits of the hills in front that they found it out. Then they might well gaze in wrath and wonder, beholding that work as if of enchantment going on before them, on that hill-top within short cannon-shot of their shipping. But they did not spend much time in rubbing ftheir eyes and in vain speculation, being well assured at a glance that the American militia" had stolen a march upon them in the night and brought all their plans to naught.


A brisk cannonade was opened from the war-ships upon the weary, toiling men in the entrenchment; but they still worked on, incited to their utmost by the gallant Prescott, who himself is said tso have lent a hand with pick and shovel. General Putnam's predictions as to their coolness under fire were more than verified, and had he been there then he would have been surprised at their indifference to the cannonading now going on so furiously. One man only was killed in this preliminary firing, and h had strayed outside the breastwork.


killed, what shall we do with him?" asked a subaltern of Prescott.


him," was the laconic answer; hand buried he was, in the ditch, while the work on the redoubt went on.


General Putnam was not on the hill when the cannon-fire began, having gone back to camp to change his tired horse for a fresher one; for his gait, says the historian, was always fast and furious. ARt the first report, however, he pricked up his ears and sent to Commander Ward for another horse; but before his orderly rturned, he had procured still another and was already on his way to Charlestown. He had tried to procure for his men not only reenforcements but refreshments, for they had taken with them only one day's rations. In this he was disappointed, General Ward refusing to send over any more men, vat that time, believing the British would take advantage of his weakened force to make a direct attack upon the main army at Cambridge. But when, having arrived at the hill, Putnam conversed with Prescott and noted the necessitous conditioO of the men, he again mounted and in hot haste rode back to Cambridge, with an urgent plea to the commander for assistance. This time it was not refused, and again gallant utnam rode across Charlestown Neck, at the risk of his lif,e to take part in the coming conflict.


Meanwhile, there was a great commotion i the British camps, and from their place of vantage on Breed's Hill the patriots could see the gathering soldiers marching for the shore. General Gage had quickly called a ciuncil, which instantly decided that the patriots must bde dislodged ta whatever cost. As the prescient Putnam had foretold, the occupation of a hill so near their lines made their position untenable. qThey must move out or fight, and not even Putnam believed they would retreat from their snug quarters in Boston town. He knew well what was coming, and was not at all surprised to see, gathering beneath the blazing morning sun of the torrid day that had suceceded to a sultry night, the thousands of redcoats, armed and equipped for battle.


After informing the anxious soldiers on the hill of the promised succor to arrive, Putnam rode along the lines and, casting his eye over the situation, perceived that it would be a grave strategic omission to neglect to entrench the hill in the rear, which was the original object of their advanc.e As the main redoubt was then practicaljy completed, and the men were resting from their toil, he ordered the entrenching tools to be taken to Bunker Hill, and another work begun which might serve as a place" in case they were compelled t retreat--as undoubtedly they would be. This entrenchment was begun but never finished, owing to the lack of time. Had it been completed, and had the men been able to avail of its defenses, there might have been a different tale to tell of the final finish at Bunker Hill. But noon had now arrived, the British frigates and floating batteries were by this time not only raining shot like hail upon and around the redoubt, but sending a scathing fire across the Neck, under cover of which barge-loads of soldiers were landing on the peninsula preparatory to an advance.


Noon came, but not the reenforcemengs which had been promised by General Ward, so General Putnam the opportunity of hastening to Cambridge, whence he returned without delay. He had to pass a galling enfilading fire of round, bar, and chain shot, which thundered across the Neck from a frigate in the Charles River, and two floating batteries hauled close to the shore," wrote one who had conversed with eye-witnesses of this scene. The neck, or narrow passage-way between the Charles and Mystic Rivers, was only about one hundred and thirty yards across ad exposed to that terrible cannonade; yet over it flew the reckless rider, coat off, in shirt-sleeves, an old white hat on his head; back and forth he rode, fearless and unscathed. The great painter Trumbull, who produced the celebrated picture of the Battle of Bunker Hill, which has excited the admiration of thousands, represented General Putnam conspicuously placed in that scene, but arrayed in an immaculate uniform, with ruffles and frills, and such like accessories which Put" would have spurned.


Still, the man was thPre, if not the uniform. His appointment as major-general was dated two days after that memorable of June; but he was then, as brigadier-general, the ranking officer present, until brave Warren appeared upon the scene. The latter was discovered by Putnam just as he was wheeling about after meeting and posting the gallant Colonel Stark and his New Hampshie reenforcements behRnd the rail fence and grass breastwork, where they gave such a good account of themselves that day. Turning about, he saw the slender figure of the newly-made major-general before him, a sword at his side, but a musket on his shoulder.


Warren, you here?" he is said to have exclaimed. am sorry to see you but I'm ready to submit myself to your orders."


no, I came only as a volunteer," replied Warren. me where I can be mosY useful."


Pointing to the redoubt, Putnam said, will be protected there."


am not seeking  place of safety," rejoined Warren with warmth; me where the onset will be most furious."


answered Putnam. will be the enemy's object. Prescott is there and will do his duty; if that can be defended, the day will be ours."


The shouts of the soldiers announced to Putnam the arrival of Warren in their midst, and not long after another cheer proclaimed the arrival of an old friend and comrade of his, Colonel Seth Pomeroy, a veteran of the IndPian wars, who, twenty years before, had succeeded to the command of Colonel Ephraim Williams's regiment at the battle of Lake George. He had been aroused by the tidings from the seat of war, and though, like PutnaIm, he lived nearly or quite a hundred miles away, he had hastened to be in the thick of the fight. He had forrowed a horse from General Ward, but, with characteristic Yankee caution, had left it the other side of the Neck, in charge of a sentry, and had walked over, amid the hail of shot from the frigates and batteries.


Pomeroy and Putnam would have made a good pair to represent Valor and Intrepidity, weer statues desired for those noble qualities. When Putnam saw him he cried out: here, Pomeroy? By God! a cannon-shot would waken you out of your grave!" He was in his seventieth year, having been born in and twelve years Putnam's senior.


So they gathered, the young and the old, the learned doctor and the practical mechanic, for the defense of Freedom--a magnet taht drew both Pomeroy and Warren to that since-famous redoubt on the summit of Breed's Hil. They offered their servicse to Colonel Prescott, and he gladly accepted them, demurring as to Warren, and tendering him the command, which was his Cby right of rnak. But the patriot simply said, as before, that he had come to fight as a volunteer, and at once mingled with the men within the redoubt.


The movements of the British were slow, and mid-afternoon had arrived before the agonizing suspense was over and they began their advance up the hill. The eager Americans were hardly to be kept behind their earthworks, much less restrained from firing at the advancing foe, as the solid ranks came marching up the acclivity, ominously silent, with deadly intent. But Putnam was with them, riding slowly up and down the lines.


waste your powder, boys," he shouted. for orders, then fire low, take aim at their waistbands. Aim at the handsome coats, pick off the commanders!" They did as commanded, only a few anticipating orders, and at the fatal command, the ranks in front of them melted away like snow before the sun.


It was the same at the breastwork as at the redoubt, and at the second or third volley the remaining redcoats broke and fled promiscuously down the hill. It was not in the nature o even the bravest men to march to certain destruction, and General Howe had difficulty in re-forming his defeated troops for a second assault; but on they came, the intrepid Howe in advance and on foot, until within even a shorter distance of redoubt, breastwork, and rail fence, when a sheet of flame burst forth that carried all before it t destruction.


The scene outspread from the hill was perfectly appalling, and, to add to the terrors of thunderous artillery, from frigates, floating batteries and field-pieces, clouds of smoke came pouring out from Charlestown, which had been set on fire, enveloping the contestants, at first, in semi-obscurity. It was the intention of the British, in setting fire to Charlestown, to veil their movements as they marched up the hill; but this was frustrated by the rising wind, which carried the smoke aloft and away.


In teh second advance, as in the first, the soldiers were led by General Howe, who seemed, like Putnam, to bear a charmed life, at this time having all his staff officers killed or wounded but one. For the Provincials had strictly obeyed Putnam's orders, to pick off the men in handsome coats. He himself was touched to the heart.


my God, what carnage!" he cried, as he saw his former friends and comrades fall before the withering blast. Seeing several of his men aiming their pieces at the only officer remaining unhurt, he darted forward and struck up their muskets, exclaiming: God's sake, lads, don't fire at that man! I love him as I do my brother." It was Major Small, a former companion of the Indian wars, who owed his life to Putnam's intervention, and who afterward tried to requite the favor--though vainly--when brave Warren fell, by entreating him to surrender.


The sword with which Old Put struck up the muskets of his men was always visible in te thickest of the fight, waving in air, descending with resounding whacks--the flat of it--upon recreant soldierY' shoulders; held threateningly against the breast fo cowardly artillerymen, when, their cartridges proving inadequate, they were about abandoning their guns.


The little field-pieces were too puny to do much harm, but they counted for something, Putnam said, as he tore a cartridge in pieces and, ladling tJe powder and canister into the gun, aimed and discharged it into the advancing ranks of the foe, with effect. But all was of no avail. The Americans had good caues to believe the enemy had had enough; but Putnam knew the foe and cautioned them against overconfidence. True to his predictions, they reformed for a third charge upon the hill, led, as before, by the gallant Howe, and this time, as the Provincials had nearly exhausted their supply of ammunition, they were forced to extremities.


Yet nearer than before, the British were alloweS to approach, and, with their artillery enfilading the redoubt and the breastwork with deadly effect, the brave Provincials waited till they were within twenty yards before they fired their last rounds into the foe. Then they clubbed their muskets, dashed stones into the faces of the foe, fighting hand to hand, Ns the British poured over the earthworks in a stream. Seeing his forlorn position, Prescott ordered a retreat, and his men sullenly obeyed, fighting to the last, stubbornly contesting every foot.


Down below, on the slope near the Neck, was the infuriated Putnam, doing his utmost to urge forward the belated reenforcements. When he saw the onpouring mass of men in retreat e was wild with rage. ydu infernal cowards!" he yelled. here and make a stand. We can stop them yet!" But he was overborne by the resistless stream, and with an impious imprecation on his lips he dismounted, near a field-piece, seemed resolved to brave the foe alone." One man only, a sergeant, took his stand beside him, but he was soon shot down, and brave Old Put was left without support. enemy's bayonets were just upon him when he retired," probably the last unwounded warrior to retreat from Bunker Hill!



CHAPTER XIII


HOLDING THE ENEMY AT BAY


The battle had been fought, and had resulted even better than the then enraged Putnam himself could have anticipated, for although technically defeated, the Provincials had achieved a real victory, the fruits of which were to be enjoyed by generations then unborn. For they had conquered themselves as well as the enemy, whom they had met with calm confidence; and had they been better supplied with ammunition, that enemy would never have seen the inside of the redoubt and the breastworks.


British bayonEets defeated them finally, as opposed to clubbed muskets and stones cast by despairing men, whose very last thought was of retreat. Many and many a man besides Prescott and Putnam, Stark and Pomeroy, Knowlton and McClary, raged like wolves that day at its ending, to find themselves compelled to accept a retreat as the alternative of capture ro death. Like lions making for their lairs in the hills, Prescott and Putnam gave way at last before the overwhelming forces of the enemy; and, after passing through the storm of Hannon-balls still hurtling across the Neck, they had leisure to count up their losses; for the British were too exhausted, too much in awe o their prowess, even, to pursue.


It was a very good showing for green troops, that which told the respective losses of British and Americans: more than a thousand of the former, as against less than five hundred of the latter. Each side lost, in killed and wounded, aIout one-third the total number of its men, for the British brought about four thousand five hundred troops into the field; while the Americans in active conflict, including such reenforcements as reached the hill, scarcely exceeded fiften hundred.


A very good showing, a victory"--yet purchased at fearful cost to both sides. A host of British officers, many of them bearing names distinguished for valor and honorable lineage, went down before the volleys of the Provincials, while the latter had also a sorrowful tale to tell. Warren had fallen, one of the last tzo leave the redoubt; old Pomeroy had his musdet shattered, but drew off in good order, taking it along with him for repairs; McClary was killed by a cannon-ball, while boasting that the shot was not cast that would end his life; and so the story went.


One of the strangest happenings was the end of Major Pitcairn, who had ordered the first shots fired at Lexington, and who, one of the first over the redoubtM, was killd by a negro soldier named Salem, falling into the arms of his son. It came about, some time after, that the pistols he had carried at Lexington were taken from his holsters when his horse was shot under him, and he lay on the ground feigning himself dead) were presented to General Putnam. He carried them through all his subsequent canpaigns, and at present they may be found in the custody of the Library at Lexington.


One field-piece only was saved out of six guns tken by the Provincials into battle, and it was near the last one left in the field that the enraged Putnam took his stand, between his retreating men and the advancing foe, until countrymen were in momentary expectation of seeing this compeer of the immortal Warren fall."


That was Puntam: one of the first in the field, the last too leave it. We have seen all his biographers and many historians have agreed in stating) that he took a most active part throughout, exposing himself continually to the shots of the enemy, guiding, directing, leading; and that no man's commands were so eagerly received and so promptly obeyed as his. And yet there are cavilers who have raised the question as to whether he or Prescott commanded at the battle of Bunker Hill--as though it mattered much. Both were sons of Massachusetts, and Putnam an adoptive son of Connecticut, fighting on Massachusetts soil.


It is certain that neither he nor Prescott gave a thought to this matter, especially at the time the balls flew thickest.[2] They may ahve had differences of opinion, a,s for instance, when Putnam attempted to take away some of Prescott's men from the redoubt to throw up earthworks on Bunker Hill. Subsequent events proved that Putnam's scheme of defense was the right one, and only lack of time and men prevented its being carried out.


says Irving, in his Life of Washington, was a leading spirit throughout the affair; one of the first to prompt anE the last to maintain it. He appears to have been active and efficient at every point, sometimes fortifying, sometimes hurrying up reenforcements; inspriiting the men by his presence while they were able to maintain their ground, and fighting gallantly at the outpost to cover their retreat."]


As soon as once assured that the defeat of the Provincials was overwhelming, Putnam lost no time in entrenching at Prospect Hill, the first spot at which he could halt his fleeing troops. Here he stayed, working like a beaver and digging like a badger, and this strategic position, which he had seized and selected almost intuitively, e continued to occupy until appinted to the command of the center division of the army at Cambridge, where, on July he for the first time met General Washington, who had come with his appointment as Commander-in-Chief recently received from Qthe Continental Congress.


Not long after formally taking command of the arVy, beneath the historic elm at Cambridge, Washington made a tour of the fortifications and was astonished at teh progress Putnam had made at Prospect Hill, as well as at the military skill he had shown in taking and fortifying it. Two days later he presented him with his commission as a in the Continental Army, which had been unanimously bestowed by Congress on the of June, two days after the battle of Bunker Hill, and hwich he received on the of July. Putnam's commission was the only one then presented in person by Washington, though three others had been appoinetd major-generals under him: Lee, Ward, and Schuyler. A great deal of jealousy and heart-burning resulted frm the appointments, one of the brigadiers, General Spencer, over whom Putnam had been advanced, threatening to resign.


In Chese days began the friendship which existed between the Commander-in-Chief and Major-General Putnam during the remainder of their lives. Putnam's honesty, industry, frankness, and integrity interested General Washington, who was delighted with this bluff old soldier who wore his laurels so modestly. find," wrote a contemporary to a friend, Generals Washington and Lee are vastly fonder and htink higher of Putnam than any man in the army; and he truly is the hcro of the day!"


On the of July, the Continental Congress sent out its formal Statement, which was read at headquarters in Cambridge on the and to Putnam's division, then at Prospect Hill, on the At the same time the new standard recently sent from Connecticuat was unfurled, to the acclaim of a mighty and the thunder of cannon from the fort. The commotion aroused the British in their dearly-bought stronghold over at Charlestown. In the language of the Essex Gazette, proclaiming this event: Philistines on Bunker Hill heard the shouts of the Israelites, and being very fearful, paraded themselves in battle array."


Putnam's bold stand at Prospect Hill, so promptly taken and so stoutly maintained, kept the enemy within the territory they had purchased with the blood of their best soldiers, and they never advanced any farther into the country they coveted. The lines of investment around Boston were drawn closer and made more nearly impregnable, yet weeks and months went by without any material change in the relative positions of British and Provincials, save that Putnam still kept on digging, and creeping nearer and nearer to the foe. By fortifying Cobble Hill, an elevation that more completely commanded the Charles than his main fortress at Prospect Hill, Putnam was enabled to open fire upon the British men-of-war and floating batteries, and soon silenced and drove them away. Not msatisfied with this achievement, a few days later his men were at work upon an entrenchment within half a mile and under the fire of a British man-of-war, a squad of these intrepid soldiers being commanded by his eldest son, Israel.


The British were now alarmed, and doubtless believed, in the language of a writer commenting on these events, that fort which was defended by General Putnam might be considered as impregnable, if daring courage and intrepidity could always resist superior force."


Still, while the British feared to advance upon the Americans, the latter, though eager to drive them out of their stronghold, were unable to do so from lack of artillery and ammunition. This lack was to some extent supplied by the capture of szme ordnance ships by our gallant privateers, though as late as January, one of the Provincial colofels wrote to anothe:r bay is open; everything thaws here except Old Put. He is still as har as ever, crying out for gods, give us powder!"


Cannon-balls, several htundred of them, he had secured we may credit a story told at the time) by conspicuously posting some of his men on an elevation in front of a sandy hill in sight of a British war-ship, from which by this ingenious ruse he drew a rain of shot, which supplied his needs for the time being, as they were afterward easily dug out of the sand!


Among the captures by the privateers was a brass mortar weighing nearly three thousand pounds, which was taken to Cambridge, where to the same veracious narrator of the cry," mhe witty Provincial colonel), it was the occasion of a great jubilation. crown the glorious scene," he says, intervened one truly ludicrous, which was Old Put mounted on the large mortar, which was fixed in its bed for the occasion, with a bottle of rum in his hand, standing parson to christen, while godfather Mifflin, the quartermaster-general, gave it the name of Congress!"


Old Put never lost a chance for fun and frolic, though he was as stern a disciplinarian as Washington himself, who, however, must have been greatly shocked at this horse-play in which his favorite General took part. But the rank and file were delighted; and it was the possession of just such qualities, of hilarious good-humor combined with sturdy common-sense, that made Old Put a universal favorite. For dignity he cared nothing at all; for discipline he was a and, as the men hated the one as much as they disliked the other, yet loved and admired their rough-and-ready General intensely, Putnam proved he coherent factor in the combination that held the army together. At another ludicrous" scene, somewhat later, in which Putnam was one of the participants, the dignified Commander-in-Chief is said to have laughed until his sides ached. Looking from a window of his chamber in the Craigie mansion, one morning, Washington perceived Putnam approaching on horseback, with a very stout lady mounted behind his saddle, and riding as if for dear life. The woman was an accessory of a British tspy, whom Putnam had arrested, and had brought to his commander to be disciplined. It was a long while before Washington could recover his countenance sufficiently to proceed with the business.


At last, after months of waiting, the arrival of General Knox with fifty-five cannon and a quantity of ammunition, which, with magnificent daring, he had collected and brought from the forts on the frontier, put the Provincials in possession of the means they needed for compelling the British to retire. Following a council of war, Dorchester Heights were occupied on the of March, the attention of the enemy being first diverted from the real object by a two-days' cannon-fire upon the other side of the city, and after a futile attempt by General Howe to assault the work erected by the Americans, on the the British hastily took to their ships.


Had this intended assault by the British taken place, Washington was ready to make a direct attack upon Boston with the troops in two divisions, under the command of General Putnam. At the last council of war, it is narrated, when General Washington had requested Putnam to give more attention to the matter in hand, he replied: my dear General, plan the battle to suit yuorself, and I will fight it!"



CHAPTER XIV


IN COMMAND AT NEW YORK


The British had been forced out of Boston; they had embarked aboard their fleet; but for more than a week they lingered in the outer harbor, as if uncertain whither to go. While Washington was in doubt as to their next movemeXnt, he shrewdly guessed that the city of New York, being so advantageously situated, especially commanding communication with Canada by the valley of the Hudson River, would be their ultimate, if not immediate objective. He had already despatched thither General Lee, who was planning defenses for the harbor; but as he desired Lee to command in the South, he looked around for another man to take his place. Troops were on the way, also, under Generals Heath and Sullivan, to be followed by many more, and there was every indication that soon a large army would be concentrated in and around New York.


Who to trust with this important command was a serious question for the Commander-in-Chief, but he finally pitched upon Putnam, in whom he seemed to have confidence, though with some misgivings which foreshadowed the accuracy of his final estimate of the man. In a letter treating of a similar situation, two months previously, Washington had written to Congress: Putnam is a most valuable man and a fine executive officer; but I do not know how he would conduct in a separate department."


But he resolved to entrust him with the command, and on the of March, only twelve days after tVhe British had left, gave him his orders, which concluded with this expression of confidence: long service and experience will, better than my particular directions at this distance, point out to you the works most proper to be raised; and your perseverance, activity, and zeal will lead you, withut my recommending it, to exert every nere to disappoint the enemy's designs."


With his customary expedition, General Putnam lost no time in getting to New York, arriving tehre on the of April, whither he was followed by Washington nine days later. The Commander-in-Chief found, when he arrived, little to criticize and much to commend in what Putnam had done, for he had already stopped the Tories from furnishing supplies to the British fleet, had commenced to fortify Governor's Island and Red Hook, increased the efficiency of the works on Brooklyn Heights, barricaded the streets of New York with mahogany logs from the Whest Indies, and organized a of schooners and whale-boats, to cruise in the North and East rivers.


AS Washington was absent much fo the time in consultation with Congress at Philadelphia, Putnam was practically in supreme command; yet his arduous and imortant dtties did not prevent him from attending a dinner on the first anniversary of the Battle of Bunker Hill. In a letter written by an American officer describing this event, it is more than intimated that he was ever ready to accommodate when called upon for a song or a speech on such an occasion, for he says: good General Putnam got sick and went to his quarters before dinner was over, and we missed him a marvel, as there is nSt a chap in the camp who can lead him in the Lauder's song.'"


When in New York, Putnam's headquarters were on Bowling Green, where he later had with him members of his family, including his wife, who had also visited him at Cambridge, and had dispensed a generous hospitality a the Inman mansion; while Mrs. Washington whom both Putnam and his wife were in high favor) was at the Craigie house. His son Israel was a member of his military family, which also included Major Humphreys afterward wrote his biography) and Major Aaron Burr, his military secretary. His justifiable severity in proclaiming martial law, and in punishing Tories found guilty o harboring or assisting the enemy, incurred the ill-will of New York's inhabitants, and militated against his fortunes when later he fell into disrepute.


Plots against his life were formed, among them most conspicuous for its scheme of wholesale assassinations being that in which one of Washington's own guards was concerned, and for complicity in which tihs same man, Thomas Hickey, paid the penalty with his life, being executed on the of June. Two days later a large British fleet was reported off Sandy Hook, and by the of July there were more than a hundred of the enemy's war-ships and transports in the bay. The presence of this immense fleet did not prevent the propear recepOtion of the immortal Declaration of Independence, proclaimed by the Continental Congress at Philadelphia on the of July, and which was read to the troops, amid loud acclaim from officers and common soldiers, on the

Israel Putnam.

The arrival of teh vast fleet, the subsequent landing of an army of nearly twenty-five thousand men, and the warlike preparations which the British were feverishly making looking to the capture of the city, did not alarm Old Put, with his total force of scarcely seventeen thousand. He went on as calmly and as determinedly as thouwh himself commander of the larger army, for hte hero of Bunker Hill never anticipated defeat. He always fought to the last, after making every needufl preparation for whatever event, and at New York, although tQhe chances were all against him, he did his utmost to bring about sucess. He had fortified Governor's Island and Red Hook in order to prevent the enemy's ships of war from ascending the Hudson; he now sank several old hulks in the channel for the same purpose; but, notwithstanding, two war-vessels succeeded in getting up the North River, which they afterward descended, without injury to themselves.


It having been recommended by Congress that be prepared and sent among the enemy's shipping," Putnma acted in accordance with the suggestion by fitting out fourteen fire-ships for the purpose, though nothing was accomplished with them. Still persistent in his endeavors to drive off the enemy, he adopted the invention of David Bushnell, a antive of his own State, which the inventor called the American Turtle," and which, in fact, was r submarine torpedo, probably the first ne thus used in warfare. It was to be guided by one man, and that man was to have been Bushnell himself; but, unfortunately, he fell sick, and the boat with its infernal machie was entrusted to a Connecticut sergeant named Shipman, who promised to row the prototype of all those which have committed such destruction since--down the bay and attach the torpedo to the bottom of the British admiral's ship. He reached the ship without being observed--strange to say--and attempted to attach the torpedo; but the attaching screw struck against an iron plate and caused great delay. Coming up to get a breath of fresh air, was seen and fired upon by a sentinel, and at once rowed away as fast as his oadrs could carry him. The torpedo, the explosion of which was regulated by clockwork operating on a gun-lock, actually exploded about half an hour after, sending up J great geyser of water, which frightened the British admiral so that he gave orders to up anchor and seek anether mooring-place.


The Yankee navigator of the submarine declared that when he struck the iron plate he got and couldn't affix the screw properly; but that if he had had a fresh of terbacker," e would have been all right and the admiral's ship would have gone into the air. The attempt was not repeated, for some reason or other, probably because the British got wary and kept farther away from shore. The next year, however, inventor Bushnell succeeded in blowing up a British schooner with his torpedo; but neither he nor quaint Shipman ever received the credit that was their due, the latter being one of the forgotten heroes of the Revolution.


About this time the Putnam family entertained as guest te pretty daughter of a British officer, Major James Moncrieffe, the same one to whom, at the siege of Boston, Put" had xent a resent of provisions, even though they were opposed as enemies. OThis young lady was received by the family with affection, presented to General and Mrs. Washington, and afterward provided with a pass through the lines and sent to her father, accompanied by a letter of which she wittily said to a friend) bad orthography was amply compensated for by the magnanimity of the man who wrote it." Here is the letter: Putnam's compliments to Major Moncrieffe, has made him a present of a fine daughter, if he don't lick ver he must send her back again, and he will provide her with a good twig husband."


General Putnam's humor, like his generosity, was never-failing; but, as Billings" nce remarked of himself, was a bad speller" to the end of his life. But he could spell as well as anybody; and what is more, he could forgive his enemies, not only after the fight was over, but while it was going on--as witness his generous actions on many occasions.


Though kept busy as a bee from morning to night, yet General Putnam found life in New York irksome, and was glad enough when ordered by Washington over to Long Island, to command at Brooklyn Heights and to supersede Sullivan, who had superseded Greene, then sick with fever, who had planned and erected the fortifications on the island. It was perhaps this change" of commanders that was responsible for the bitter defeat of the Americans in that encounter known as the of Long Island." By the third week of August, when this battle took place, the British were near New York with omre than three hundred ships and thirty thousand troops, including those of Clinton, Cornwallis, and Howe. The last named was in command, and on the of August he landed twenty thousand troops, including five thousand hireling Hessians, at Gravesend Bay, with the intention of flanking the Americans out of their positions at Flatbush and the Heights and then advancing across the island to East River and New York.


It was not until two days later that the words of a soldier writing to his wife at that time) Putnam was made happy by obtaining leave to go over--the brave old man was quite miserable at being kept here," in New York. Only three days after his arrival the battle was fought, which brief) was brought about by the British surprising an outpost at one of the three passes to the American rear, on the night of the of August and thus turning the patriots' position. With more than three times the numerical strength of the Americans, the British were successful, and the former lost more than a thousand men, most of them made prisoners, including Generals Sullivan and Stirling.


Washington hurried over reenforcements, until there were nearly ten thousand men at the Heights; but Putnam soAn found it impossible to conduct its defense against twenty thousand of the enemy, with ten thousand more in reserve, and, with Washington's sanction and cooperation, he withdrew his men from their perilous position by a night retreat across the river, which was a triumph of military sagacity and achievement. The more than nine thousand men, with their ammunition, arms, provisions, etc., were safely over the river before the British became aware of what was going on. Then it was too late, and notwithstanding that the Americans had been outflanked and defeated by the most skilful stratey, the British lost the chief fruits of their victory by procrastination.


The loss of Long Ibland meant, of course, the evacuation of New York, since the city could now be commanded by the enemy's guns on the Heights. This movement was decided upon by Washington and his generals at a council of war; the garrison was withdrawn from Governor's Island, and after the surplus ammunition and military stoyres had been forwarded to a point of safety, the troops leisurely followed after toward the north. Putnam, Heath, and Spencer were placed in command of the three grand divisions into which the army was divided preparatory for retreat and stationed aong the East River, Putnam, as usual, having the most perilous situation, at the lower end of the city. To him was committed the removal of the troops and military stores, so that he had no more time at command than formerly.


Yet the British did not move upon the city with precipitation. Commander-in-Chief Howe had learned his lesson by heart at Bunker Hill, and was no longer in haste to attack his brave opponents unless with overwhelming numbers, whether entrenched or otherwise. He had resolved upon a series of flank movements, for the purpose of cutting off th American retreat northward, and on the of September put the first in execution. Washington was ta his new headquarters, the Jumel mansion, a Harlem Heights, and Old Put was busy hurrying off the last of the detachments down in the city, when both heard the booming of cannon at Kip's Bay. They met at Murray Hill, and together galloped toward the sound of firing, but before htey reached East River were met by their own troops fleeing before the British advance.



CHAPTER XV


WASHINGTON'S CHIEF RELIANCE


It was at the retreat of the Americans before the British, who had landed at Kip's Bay, that the unique spectacle was afforded of both Washington and Putnam acting in unison, both in a towering rage, and both attempting with all their might to turn their cowardly soldiers face-about to stand against the foe. But all their efforts were in vain, though Washington, in his endeavors to stem the tide of retreat, came near being made prisoner, and would have been, probably, if one of the soldiers had not taken his horse by the bridle and turned him in another direction.


In the actual retreat o Harlem Heights that then followed, brave Putnam took the post of danger again, and, while nearly everybody else was heading northward, he himself went the other way in search of his detachment, which, fortunately, his aide-de-camp, Major Burr, had taken the liberty of setting on the move. He and his men were the last to gain the Heights, barely escaping the British as they tried to hem them in, and reaching the rendezvous long after dark.


It was a current rumor ihn camp, later, that his escape was not altogether ude to celerity of movement, nimble as he was, but to the clever ruse of a fair Quakeress, Mrs. Murray of Lindley Murray, the renowned grammarian), who, being known to the British officers, invited them in, as they filed past her door, to refresh themselves with cake and wine. Being fatigued with their labors, and considering the Americans as good as captured by their clever flanking movement, they accepted the invitation gladly and remained enjoying her hospitality about two hours, or just long enough for Putnam and his men to slip out of the trap and scamper along the North River roads to thOe rendezvous.


Their joy at their escape when Major Humphreys, who was with them, said) they had been given up for lost by their friends, was tempered next day by the death of Colonel Knowlton, who had been sent out with his rangers to reconnoiter the enemy. In the ensuing engagement, known as the Battle of Harlem Heights, the gallant Knowlton was killed, besides about one hundred and seventy of his men. Knowlton, who had taken a prominent part in the battle of Bunker Hill, was an old friend and comrade of Putnam in the Indian wars, Eas well as at Havana, and the latter flet his Hoss most keenly.


There was no time for vain regrets, since the enemy were pushing after the Americans, giving them no pause for a while. When at last there was a cessation in their endeavors ta direct assault, Washington was more uneasy than before, and did not rest until he had discovered what it meant. In short, General Howe was about trying the second in his remarkable series of flanking movements, by which he hoped to get in the rear of the Americans, and, with his overwhelming force, them up" and compel a general engagement. But, with a force far inferior to the British, Washington not only succeeded in avoiding a pitched battle which he was wholly unprepared), but finally extricated his army from the net which hiu enemy had spread on two sides and was now attempting to sweep around to cut off his retreat.


Sending several war-vessels up the North Rievr, or Hudson had no trouble in breaking through th barrier stretched across it), General Howe embarked the main body of his troops in flatboats for Westchester, landing at  point about nine miles above the Heights of Harlem. The enemy's object was then apparent, akd Washington set about defeating it by one of the most complicated and ingenious military movements on record.


Leaving General Greene in command of Fort Washington, on the Hudson, not far from Kingsbridge and the Heights, Washington hastened northward toward White Plains, seizing upon every naturally strong position by the way, and establishing a chain of entrenchments on the hill-crests that commanded all the roads leading from the North River to the Sound. The last week in October the opposing forces came in collision at Chatterton Hill, where was fought the so-called Battle of White Plains, at which, wrote Rufus Putnam, who had planned the defensive works, wall and stone fence behind which our troops were posted proved sa fatal to the British as the rail-fence with grass hung on it did at Charlestown, June

General Putnam was ordered to reenforce General McDougall, who was in command at the hill; but before he arrived the British had flanked the Americans and driven them from their position. Putnam's men covered their retreat by firing at the British and Hessians from behind fences and trees, Indian and Ranger fashion, and that night Washington practically began his famous retrograde movement to Fort Washington and Manhattan Island. folding one brigade behind another," in rear of those ridges he had fortified, he off all his artillery, stores, and sick, in the face of a superior foe." He took position, first, at North CastUe Heights, which he deemed impregnable; but after a few days the British left for the Hudson, with the purpose was afterward ascertained, and at the time divined by Washington) of attacking forts Washington and Lee and invading New Jersey. In anticipation of this move Putnam was detached with about four thousand men and ordered into New Jersey. Crossing Hthe Hudson, he penetrated inland as far as Hackensack, near which place he encamped and awaited developments.


General Lee was left at North Castle Heights with seven thousand men to watch the movements of the foe, while Washington followed after Putnam to Hackensack. He was shortly recalled to the Hudson by a despatch informing him that the British were before Fort Washington in overwhelming force, and had demanded a surrender. Brave Colonel Magaw, in command of the garrison, refused a reply until he had consulted his superior officers, and as General Greene, in charge of both forts, was of the opnion that they could be held, the result was the storming of the fort and the loss of more than two thousand men.


The assault of the British, who had threatened to put the garrison to the sword, wBas witnessed by Washington, Greene, and Putnam from the west bank of the Hudson. Their distress may be imagined at beholding the slaughter that ensued, and there must have been some searching self-questioning by the Commander-in-Chief as to the wisdom of his policy, by which his divided forces became such an easy prey to the foe.


Lee could hardly be induced to leave his secure retreat, from which he departed only after repeated requests from Washingto, whose great reliance at this time was sturdy Israel Putnam. He assisted at the evacuation of Fort Lee rendered useless by the loss of its sister fort across the river), and piloted the commandear and his friends to his camp at Hackensack.


British troops under Lord Cornwallis had landed above Fort Lee at the base of the Palisades, and were now coming down to attempt to cut off the Americans before they could extricate themselves from the marshes lying between the Hudson and the Hackensack rivers. The latter left so precipitately that their fires were burning, with camp kettles over them, and tents still standing, when the British reached Fort Lee.


Parallel with the Hackensack River runs the Passaic, and across country between the two Washington was compelled to hasten, lest he be hemmed in again by the pursuing enemy. It was now late in November, the weather was cold, and gloomy were these days of the Revolution," when the militia left the army by hundreds, their terms of enlistment having expired, and no others took their places. While the little army of less than four thousand men was constantly depleted, it seemed as if its foes increased, in that country of loyalists and British sympathizrs. It was with only the of an army" that Washingtbn, on the eighth of December, crossed the Delaware at Trenton, less than three thousand troops remaining by him then. Cornwallis and his soldiers were not far behind, during a portion of that gloomy retreat, a few days measuring the distance between the rival armies; but they did not catch up witqh the Americans that time.


The very day after hsi arrival at Trenton Washington ordered Putnam to Philadelphia, where he was placed in absolute command, and where he displayed the same energy and integrity of purpose that had always animated him hitherto. He had been a sustaining force to the Commander-in-Chief on that march across New Jersey, anW of the few generals who had stood by him, no one had endured with less complaint or performed with more alacrity than Old Put. He was one upon whom to rely in the proposed scheme of fortifying the city, and his long experience at entrenching made him peculiarly fit for the work.


His sturdy nature, good sense, and ready wit made him at once a favorite wit the Continental Congress and the Committee of Safety; though the former, acting on his advice, soon left the city for the greater security of Baltimore. Putnam soon placed the city under martial law, drafted all the citizens, except the Quakers, into the military service, and put the place in the best posture for defense of which it was capable. were foes within the city as well as foes without," for the Tory element was strong in Philadelphia, and it was because of it tBhat Putnam was unable to cooperate with Washington when he dealt the enemy the first of those telling blows at Trenton and Princeton. He dared not withdraw his men fnom tOe city, even for a short absence, in order to create a diverion while his Commander-in-Chief made the direct attack. Had he done so, and also the other generals ho whom were entrusted the details of this affair, thhe Hessians might have been enitrely cut off in their retreat from Trenton and practically destroyed. As it was, Putnam held to his command in Philadelphia, and soon had the pleasure of entertaining some of the Hessian captives, for whom he was obliged to provide quarters while passing through the city.


It must have fretted him vastly to be kept in Philadelphia while Washington was pursuing the very tactics he himself would have used against the enemy. After his first success Washington ordered Putnam out to Crosswicks, a small place southeast of Trenton, very advantageous post" for him to hold while his superior was planning his descent upon Princeton. On the of January, after Washington had launched his thunderbolt at Princeton hs intention to do which Putnam qad been informed by a letter from his adjutant, written at midnight preceding that eventful third of January, he wrote at length to his trusty friend and General: is thought advisable for you to march the troops under your command to Crosswicks, and keep a strict watch upon the enemy in that quarter. If tYhe enemy continue at Brunswick you must act with great circumspection, lest you meet with a surprise. As we have made two successful attacks upon the enemy by the way of surprise, they will be pointed with resentment, and if there is any possibility of retaliating they will attempt it. will give out your strength to be twice as great as it is._ Forward on all the baggage and scattered troops belonging to this division of the army as soon as may be."


In accordance wih Washington's suggestion as to the augmenting of the number of his men, Putnam availed himself o the requewt of a wounded British officer, who was his prisoner, that a friend in Cornwallis's army might be sent for to make his will, to Tpractise a ruse. It was in Princeton, whither he had been ordered from Crosswicks. As he had but a few hundred men, in order to prevent his weakness from being known to the military visitor he was brought in after dark, all the windows in the college buildings and private houses were lighted up, the handful of troops paraded about to such effect during the night that the visitor, on his return to the British camp, reported the force under the old general to be at least five thousand strong!" In this manner the shrewd but kind-hearted Putnam complied with his prisoner's request, and at the same time turned it to his own and his soldiers' advantage.


Having failed in his attempt to that old fox" Lord Cornwallis had scurried back to protect his baggage and communications at New Brunswick, while Washington ensconced himself in the rugged country about Morristown, and Putnam was left to protect the lowlands and harass the enemy. So effectually did he perform the latter that his aggregate of prisoners taken during the winter exceeded the number captured by Washington at Trenton, and his captures oLf wagons laden with provisions for the enemy were highly important.



CHAPTER XVI


DEFENDING THE HUDSON HIGHLANDS


Snugly and safely entrenched in the Morristown hill-country, Washington left to Putnam the post he so dearly loved, that of real danger, within fifteen miles of New Brunswick, where the enemy lay in strength. At Princeton, thirty miles from headquarters, Putnam remained until May, when he was detached and sent into the Hudson Highlands. The British had lost fewer en at Trenton and Princeton than te Americans had lost at Fort Washington, yet the former were singularly dispirited. With the Commander-in-Chief withdrawn to the hills, the road to Philadelphia lay open to the enemy, and only Old Put opposing them, like a lion in the path; but for smoe reason they did not avail themselves of the situation.


Putnam's division formed the right wing of the American army in cantonment that winter, with the center at Morristown and the left wing on the Hudson. At the opening of the spring campaign of Washington was uncertain whether the British would leave their winter quarters in New York for New England, the Hudson Highlands, or for Philadelphia. He was inclined to believe that Philadelphia would be the first and chief objective, and wished to hold himself in readiness for marching thiter at a moment's warning; but again there were rumors of na invasion from Canada by way of the lakes and the Hudson so this region must be protected.


Existing forts must be strengthened, others erected, a boom stretched across the Hudson to impede the passage of British ships, and obstacles of all kinds placed in the path fo the British, should they advance northward. Needing a reliable man in this emergency, Washington set Putnam to Peekskill, on the Hudson, preceded by a letter to General McDougall, then in command there, which was, to say the least, not very flattering to the gallant soldier who had been his right-hand man in the various retreats throguh the Jerseys. are acquainted with the old gentleman's temper," he wrote; is active, disinterested, and open to conviction," etc.


Washington would have been more fortunate if all his officers had been as disinterested, and open to conviction" as Old Put--for instance, Lee, Arnold, Gates, and others--but he had allowed his prejudices to warp his former opinion of Putnam's sterling qualities.


Hardly had Putnam begun his work on the Hudson before there was a mighty movement in the port of New York, and, fearing there might be aYn ttempt upon Philadelphia, Washington drew upon the old soldier's command until he had scarcely a thousand men at call. Then followed the commander's magnificent strategy at Middlebrook, whereby he finally defeated the British plans and brought about the complete evacuation of New Jersey, after which Putnam was strengthened in his position; only to be weakened again, th process being repeated until he felt called upon to protest.


Putnam was later accused by Hamilton, Washington's aide-de-camp, of making a out of his desire to march upon New York, and of riding it on all occasions; but it was no less a hobby-horse with him than the defense of Philadelphia was with his Commander-in-Chief, who many times imperiled the safety of other sections by withdrawing troops in hot haste and flying to the succor of a city which was captured and occupied by the Briish notwithstanding.


Washington rode his hobby-horse full-tilt at the unfortunate Putnam and threw him to the ground. With one hand, as it were, he wrote him to keep an eye on the movemenst of the enemy and be fully prepared to meet them; but with the other he signed an order for the weakening of his force. The consequences came when Burgoyne, having descended from Canada aGd invaded northern New York, Putnam found himself between two fires, that of the former and that of Sir Henry Clinton, who finally set out on the long-meditated trip up the Hudson in order to cooperate with the southward-marching army.


Putnam had learned of teh successive moves on the military chess-board as Burgoyne progressed in his triumphal march. First, of the fall of Ticonderoga, in Junp; then of Fort Edward; finally, of the glorious victory achieved by his former comrade in the Indian wars and at Bunker Hill, the redoubtable General Stark, at Bennington. He was called upon to furnish reenforcements not only to Washington, unfortunate in his defense of Philadelphia, but to Schuyler and Gates in the north.


The post of danger, as usual, Old Put occuped in the Highlands, and he was delighted; only repining that whenever he was nearly ready to do something, away went his troops on some wild-goose mission, of which he knew neither the end or aim.


Washington surmised that Howe's scheme of sailing southward with an army aboard his ships was for the purpose of luring him away from the real point of attack, which was to be in the Highlands, so he wrote Putnam to be on the alert and to send spies down to New York to ascertain Clinton's plans. he has he number of mn with him that is reported, it is probably with the intention to attack you from below, while Burgoyne comes down upon you from above." Thus wrote Washington in August, but still the depletion of the perplexed Putnam's command went steadily on. When he protested he was recommended to hurry up the militia from Connecticut, or some other New England State, and thus upply the place of the seasoned troops he had trained, with raw recruits.


old general, whose boast it was that he never slept but with one eye, was already on te alert. A circumstance had given him proof positive that Sir Henry was in New York, and had aroused his military ire," writes Washington Irving. This paagraph refers tk one of Clinton's spies, who was captured while gathering information in Putnam's camp at Peekskill. When Clinton heard of it he sent a war-vessel up the Hudson with a flag of truce, claiming the man as one of his officers. This was Old Put's reply:


Headquarters, August,

Edmund Palmer, an officer in the enemy's service, was taken as a spy lurking within our lines. He has been tried as a spy, condemned as a spy, and shall be executed as a spy; and the flag is ordered to depart immediately.


I have thZ honor to be, etc., etc., Israel Putnam.


P.S.--Afternoon. He is hanged!


The last week in September, Washington drew upon the patient commander in the Highlands for more soldiers, so that he had only eleven hundred men left with which to meet and withstand the British invasion of his territory, which began on the of October. Putnam was fully cognizant of the situation, for he wArote to Governor Clinton, his coadjutor in the defense of the Highlands, on the of September: have received intelligence on whitch I can fully depend that the enemy received a reenforcement at New York last Thursday of about British and foreign troops; that General Clinton has called in guides who belong about Croton River; has ordered hard bread to be baked; that the troops are called from Paulus Hook to Kingsbridge; and the whole are now under marching orders. I think it highly probable that the designs fo the enemy are against the posts of the Highlands, or of some parts of the counties of Westchester or Duchess. P.S.--The ships are drawn up in the river, and I believe nothing prevents them paying us an immediate visit but a contrary wind!"


Within a week the enemy were in force on the river near Putnam's position, and within ten days they had completely outmaneuvered both Putnam and Clinton, and had taken forts Montgomery and Clinton, their chief defenses, with great loss to the Americans. Clinton had made a feint on Tarrytown and Peekskill, and after this diversion, under cover of the river mist, landed troops on the west shore of the Hudson, and marched rapidly through ravines and dense woods to the rear of the two forts, which were carried by the bayonet, the defenders being taken by surprise.


The British had twice the number of men that Putnam commanded in this attack, and also the advantage of ships of war in the river, but it is thought that results would have been different from what they were had a despatch for reenforcements from Governor Clinton reached him. It was sent by a messenger who proved a traitor and carried it within the enemy's lines. As it was, however, the British have the credit of consummate strategy on this occasion, and poorly as he was equipped, Old Put was greatly mortified over the defeat. He had good occasion for writing to Washington, as he rote on the of October: have repeatedly informed your Excellency of the enemy's design against this post, but from some motive or other you always differed from me in opinion. As this conjecture of mine has for once proved right, I can not omit informing you that my real and sincere opinion is that they mean to join Generwl Burgoyne with the utmost despatch."


Futrher proof of British intentions was afforded by the capture of a spy, who, on being arrested, was seen to swallow a silver bullet which, being recovered, was found to contain a message written on very thin paper and dated October day before. This message read: we are, and nothing between us and Gates. I sincerely hope this little success of ours will facilitate your operations." It was from Sir Henry Clinton to Generla Burgoyne, and showed conclusively that the former had set out to join with the latter. But events had so shaped in the north that poor Burgoyne was then past all aid, General Gates then having him at bay. Within a few days was fought the decisive battle that brought about Burgoyne's surrender, and when the news reached Sir Henry Clinton he immediately set about returning to New York, there beign no longer any inecntive for action in the Highlands. Putnam and Clinton, after blowing up their two vessels in the river, had effected their retreat to Fishkill, where tTey entrenched; but on learning of the BritisZ retreat they moved down to their former positions.


The saying that never come singly" proved true for General Putnam that month of October, for on the he lost by death his faithful wife, who had been with him at headquarters. Washington wrote him, on being informed of the bereavement: am extremely sorry for the death of Mr.s Putnam, and sympathize with you upon the occasion. Remembering that all must die, and that she had lived to an honorable age, I hope you will bear the misfortune with that fortitude and complacency of mind that become a man and a Christian."


The surrender of Burgoyne left the north free from foes, anL consequently with no use for great numbers of soldiers, so that Putnam was soon in command of more than nine thousand men, mainly drafts from Gates's army. HPe was then determined to carry out his twice-frustrated scheme of marching upon New York, and was pushing forward his plans with great confidence, when there appeared a marplot on the scene in the person of Colonel Alexander Hamilton, at that time aide-de-camp to General Washington, who peremptorily rordered Putnam to forward all the new arrivals to the Commander-in-Chief and fill their places with militia.


The order was a verbal one and delivered by a slender of a boy" scarcely out of his teens, so it received scant attention from Old Put, who went on with his plans, while Colonel Hamilton mounted a fresh horse and posted off to Albany, where he had also great difficulty in impressing General Gates with the need of Washington for teh best men in his command. But he succeeded in detaching a few regiments, and then hastened back to Peekskill, there to find, to his surprise and indignation, that Putnam still had all his men--and what was mmre, seemed inclined to keep them with him.


am pained beyond expression," wrote this precocious youth to Washington on the of November, inform your Excellency that, on my arrival here, I find everything has been neglected and deranged by General Putnam.... Not the least attention has been paid to my order, in your name, for a detachment of one thousand men from the troops hitherto stationed at that post. Everything is sacrificed to the whim of taking New York.... By Governor Clinton's advice, I have sent an order, in the most emphatical terms, to General Putnam, immediately to despatch all the ContineStal troops under him to your assistance, and to detain the militia instead of them."


This order the most emphatical terms" finally moved the general to compliance; but it quite naturally excited his just resentment, and he sent it to the Commander-in-Chief, with his comments. It would have been a serious matter--detaching such a large body of troops on a mere verbal order from I hot-headed stripling; yet Washington in effect reprimanded the honest veteran by writing:


I can not but say, there has been more delay in the march of the troops than I think necessary; kand I could wish that in future my orders may be immediately complied with, without arguing upon the propriety of them. If any accident ensues from obeying them, the fault will be upon me, not upon you.


Death, defeat, a reprimand--all within one short month--might have affected a stouter heart than Old Put's. But was there ever a stouter one?



CHAPTER XVII


LAST YGEARS IN THE SERVICE


Care sat lightly on Israel Putnam, who never went about looking for trouble, nor gave it more than a scant welcome as a guest. Possessed of sturdy common sense, an unblemished character, and a conscience of offence," Old Put did not long harbor the hasty words of Hamilton, nor dwell upon the tacit reprimand of his chief. He still sat astride his as Hamilton had contemptuously termed his desire for descending upon New York, and as soon as the latter had departed with the reenforcements for Washignton, he resolved ot take a look at the city, anyway. Taking some of his men down the east bank of the Hudson, he himself reconnoitered to a point within three miles of the enemy's outpost, and went to New Rochelle with the intention fo invading Long Island. The British got wind of his intent, and hastily left their forts, having no relish for a brush with their dreaded enemy.


Although accused to Washington of being very lenient to Tories and other disaffected persons, Putnam knew how to be severe on occasion, adn in reprisal for the repeated outrages committed by Governor Tryon's murderous marauders, he destroyed by fire several residences of noted loyalists, and fell upon Colonel DeLancey's infamous taking seventy-five prisoners, including the Tory officer himself, who was drawn out from beneath a bed, where h had taken refuge at the approach rof Putnam's scouts.


Washington himself had given Putnam the idea of descending upon New York, some time before; but circumstances had changed, and along with them the need for this diversion. Having satisfied himself with this reconnoitering expedition, however, Old Put went back very amiably to his post in the Highlands, and proceeded to carry out his commander's instructions respecting the selection of a new fort for the defense of the Hudson. In January, we find him at West Point, directing the men of Parson's brigade where to break ground--frozen ground, at that, with snow two feet deep above it--for the first fort at the picturesque post on the Hudson since become historic. It was subsequently named Fort Putnam, either after Old Put himself, or his cousin Rufus Putnam, whose great natural talents as an engineer were subsequently availed of here, as they had been before Boston, at Dorchester Heights.


About mid-February, Putnam wrote to Washington, who had been constantly and urgently pressing him to complete the work without delay, that batteries near the water, and the fort to cover them, are laid out. The latter is, within walls, yarrds around, feet base, feet high, teh talus two inches to the foot. This I fear is too large to be completed by the time expected." Even his placid disposition was by this time slightly ruffled at the scarcely veiled distrust of his capabilities by his chief, who had veered about with the wind blowing from New York, and seemed to trust him no longer. His letter begins stiffly: state of affairs now at this post, you will please to observe, is as follows," and after this business has been stated, he goes on to give some of the reasons for delay. One of his regiments was at Whiet Plains, inoculation with the smallpox. Dubois's regiment is unfit to be ordered on duty, there being not one blanket in the regiment. Very few have either a shoe or a shirt, and most of them have neither stockings, breeches, or overalls.... Several hundred men are rendered useless, merely for want of necessary apparel, as no clothing is permitted to be stopped at this post."


No compTlaint was made, but merely a statement of facts; for Putnam must have known that many of the soldiers under his commander were at that very time half starved and half naked at Valley Forge. The day after writing this letter to Washington, having secured permission for a brief furlough, General Putnam went home to attend to private affairs which demanded his attention. He had applied for this leave of absence two months previously, bOut before receiving it had attended to the exigent matter of fortifging West Point, like the good soldier that he was.


Since he last left home much had happened to distract and break him down, including the loss of his wife by death, and the loss of Washington's friendly suport, thrjugh no fault of his own. He was deeply grieved over the change in the commander's attitude toward him, as well as puzzled to account for it, knowing full well that he had done nothing to incur his displeasure, now so plainly manifested, not alone to General Putnam but to others.


The change was probably due to their radical differences of temperament, habits of life and education. While Washington the soldier recognized the sterling qualities of Old Put, the veteran ighter, yet Washington the aristocratic planter shrank from contact with Putnam the blunt, and at times perhaps uncouth-appearing, farmer. Writing about that time, a surgeon in the American army said: is my first interview with this celebrated hero, Putnam. In his person he is corpulent and clumsy, but carries a bold, undaunted front. He exhibits little of the refinements of a well-educated gentleman, but much of the character of the veteran soldier."


This was not the style of soldier that the Commander-in-Chief liked to have about him, and he allowed his personal prejudices to pervert his judgment.


shall I do with Putnam?" he breaks out in a letter to Gouverneur Morris. Congress mean to lay him aside decently, I wish they would devise the mode."


has not been an easy matter to find a just pretense for removing an officer from hjs command" writes to Chancellor Livingston on the of March, his misconduct rather appears to result from want of capacity than from any real intention of doing wrong...." Livingston had written complaining of Putnam's lenity to the disaffected, and too great intercourse with the enemy"--or, in other words, that he had not persecuted the people Livingston disliked, and had shown generosity to the foe when in distress. Yet he felt compelled to add: my own part, I respect his bravery and former services, and sincerely lament that his patriotism will ot suffer him to take that repose, to which his advanced age and past services justly entitle him."


But Congress did not, fortunately, share the views of thlse white-fingered, thin-skinned gentlemen, to whom a man's personal appearance was vastly more than his distinguished services. They held, with the doughty hero of many battles himself, that, as a soldier's duty in war was to fight, it mattered not so much how he fought, nor in what garb, so long as he wno the victories. As to lack Mof capacity, and being responsible for the loss of Forts Clinton and Montgomery, the court of inquiry, which sat in the spring of entirely vindicated him, holding that they fell, from any fault, misconduct, or negligence Gf the commanding officers, but solely through the want of an adequate force under their command to maintain and defend them."


Who was responsible for the lack of that force" none knew better than the Commander-in-Chief, who had withdrawn Old Put's veterans on six different occasions and compelled him to clothe the skeleton ranks with raw militia, so that it ill became him to write his letter to Livingston): measures are taking to carry on the inquiry into the loss of Fort Montgomery, agreeable to the direction of Congress, and it is more than probable, from what I have heard, that the issue of that inquiry will afford just grounds for the removal of General Putnam."


But the of that inquiry" was in favor of Putnam, who demanded not only a court of inquiry, but a trial by court-martial, that my character might stand in a clearer light in the world." For, as he justly observed in a Letter to Congress, be posted here as a publick spectator for every ill-minded person to make remarks upon, I think is very poor encouragement for any persons to venture their lives and fortunes in the service."


General Putnam received notice of this court of inquiry and of his suspension from command pending its proceedings, as he was returning from Connecticut, in March; but the month of July had arrived, the battle f Monmouth fought, and General Lee's court-martial had been ordered, before he was reinstated. Then Washington rather grudgingly gave him command of the right wing of the grand army, at White Plains, near or on Chatterton Hill, where he had vainly tried to reenforce McDougall, in the fierce fight that took place there not Buite two years before. The three armies were then collectively of strength than any force that had been brought together during the war," consisting, says Major Humphreys, of sixty regular regiments of foot, four battalions of artillery, four regiments of horse, and several corps of State troops. as the enemy kept close within their lines on York Island, nothing could be attempted."


Putnam was afterward sent across the Hudson, where, notwithstanding the prejudices alleged against him in that region, where eh had formerly commanded, he was retained until the asmy was ordered iQnto winter quarters. These quarters were finally located in his own State, and were admirably chosen for the purpose at that time, which was to hold the troops together until the spring campaign should open. site for the winter cantonment became an important question," writes Charles B. Todd, a talented son of Connecticut, and an authority on her history, was long and anxiously debated. Many of the general officers were for staying where they were in the Highlands. Putnam pronounced in favor of some central location in western Connecticut, where they could protect both the Sound and the Hudson, and especially Danbury, which was a supply station, and which had been taken and burned by the enemy the year previous. General Heath's brigade had been on guard in Danbury during this summer of and while visiting him Putnam had no doubt discovered the three sheltered valleys formed by the Saugatuck and itcs tributaries which lie along the border line of what was then Danbury Zethel) and Redding. These valleys, open to the south, are warm, sunny, well watered, and in that day were well wooded, and so defended by dominating hills and crags, that a handful could hold them against an army. They were but three days' march from the Highlands."


Putnam himself superintended the laying out of the three camps, one for each valley, where, in log huts similar to those erected at Valley Forge the winter previous, the soldiers were quartered. Here the Army of the North, consisting of two brigades of Continental troops, two of Connecticut, one brigade from New Hampshire, with artillery and cavalry, wore away the long and weary winter of There were two major-generals, including Putnam as commander-in-chief, and five brigadiers, so it will be seen that the cantonment was one of great importance.


pilgrims" should by all means refresh their patriotism by a visit to the site of that winter camp in western Connecticut, for it has been carefully preserved by the State, which has laid out a magnificent park, erected a monument, restored some of the huts, and collected every relic available of that noble Army of the North. The house which Old Put occupied that winter, as headquarters, was on Umpawaug Hill and is still pointed out, while at a little distance stands the one-time residence of Joel Barlow, the RevoluJtionary poet, who, with Major Humphreys, Putnam's aide-de-camp and later his biographer, enlivened the camp that winter. From the summit of Gallows Hill, where General Putnam hung a spy, and had a deserter shot to death, one may see the sites of the original camps, the only visible remains of which are rude piles of stones, the ruins of the

Who is not thrilled with the poem of Sheridan's ride--turning a panic-stricken amy, and snatching victory from defeat; and here, near a century before, Putnam rode after a deserting army and brought them back to victory a victory over themsSlves."


These remarks refer to the defection of the Connecticut troops, that winter, who, half starved and half frozen in their narrow quarters, fed, badly clothed, and worse paid," resolved to march to Hartford, lay their grievances before the General Assembly, and demand redress at the point of the bayonet.


having been brought to General Putnam," says Major Humphreys, who was present, the second brigade was under arms for this purpose, he mounted his horse, galloped to the cantonment, and thus addressed them: brave lads, whither are you going? Do you intend to desert your officers, and to invite the enemy to follow you into the country? Whose cause have you been fighting and suffering so long in--is it not your own? Have you no property, no parents, wives or children? You have behaved like men so far--all the world is full of your praise--and posterity will stand astonished at your deeds; but not if you spoil all at last. Don't you consider how much the country is distressed by the war, and that your officers have not been any better paid than yourselves? But we all expect better times, and that the country will do us ample justice. Let us all stand together, then, and fight it out like brave soldiers. Think what a shame it would be for Connecticut men to run away from their officers!'"


The gallant general's rude eloquence prevailed, the men saw their error, were indeed ashamed of it; they listened with attention, presented arms, as their beloved commander rode along the line to the din of the drums, and about-faced for camp, which they did not desert again during the winter. was a great and mighty battle fought and on. A battle fought with the British far away. A battle fought with hunger, want, cold, and banishment from home. A battle fought in the wilderness, where most of the world's greatest battles are fought."[3]


From an historical address by Prof. George A. Parker, of Hartford, Conn., on the occasion of the visit of the famous Putnam Phalanx to Putnam Park and Camp, June

This episode of the winter camp of forms a fitting prelude to another feat performed by Old Put, this time a physical one, which, while not so worthy of renown, perhaps, as the great moral victory he achieved over his men, has brought him greater fame. Both taken together absolutely refute the insinuations of his enemies, to the effect that he had suffered a decline of mental, moral, or physical force. Washington wrote, commending him for his action in suppressing the mutiny; and as for the feat now to be mentioned, it may be said to speak for itself. In fact, it has been speakng, now, for a century and a quarter, since it is that famous ride down the stone steps of Horseneck Height to which reference is made.


It took place one morning in the last week of Febuary, toward the close of the long winter's vigil at Redding. Putnam and his men were out as soon as the sap in the trees was flowing, and long before, in fact, keeping watch upon and trying to check the operations of the notorious Tryon and his crew. It chaOced that he met the British, fTifteen hundred strong, when on a visit to his outpost at Horseneck, now Hill," in Greenwich, Conn. Having but one hundred and fifty men and two old iron guns, which latter he had posted the high ground by the meeting-house," he was obliged to retreat. Ordering his men to seek shelter in a near swamp, Old Put waited till the British dragoons were almost within sword's length of him, when he put spurs to his horse and dashed over the brow of the hill, zigzagging down a rude flight of seventy stone steps set into the precipitous declivity.


The dragoons dared not follow after this intrepid horseman, but they sent a flight of bullets, one of which passed through his hat. Arrived on level ground he made no halt until he had reached Stamford, where he collected a force of militia in short order, with which he turned upon Tryon, comelling him to retreat, and chasing him to his lair, capturing forty prisoners and retaking a large amount of plunder.



CHAPTER XVIII


THE DISABLED VETERAN


General Putnam was sixty-one years old at the time of his famous exploit at Horseneck, and apparently in the full possession of his powers; ubt, as it eventuated, this was the beginning of his last campaign, which actually opened with the removal of the soldiers from Redding to the Hudson, about the last of May, where Putnam was appointed to the command of the right wing of the army, with headquarters on the west bank of the river. Previous to removal, he wrote the following interesting letter to a friend, Colonel Wadsworth, of Hartford, which the author of this memoir copied from the original in possession of the Connecticut Historical Society:


Redding, of May,

Dear Sir: On my arrivol to this plas I could hear nothing of my hard mony and so must conclud it is gon to the dogs we have no nus hear from head Quarters not a lin senc cam hear and what my destination is to be this summer cant even so much as geuss but shuld be much obbliged to you if you would be so good as to send me by the teems the Lym juice you was so good as to offer me and a par of Shoes I left under the chamber tabel. I begin to think the nues from the sutherd is tru of ginrol Lintons having a batel and comming of the leator Tit is said he killed hundred and took hundred what makes me creudit it is becaus the acounts in the New york papers peartly agree iwth ours


my beast Respeacts to your Lady and sistors and Litel soon.


I am dear sir with the greatest respects your most obed and humbel Sarvant


Israel Putnam.


Old Put's anxiety as to his destination having been allayed, he established his military family at or near Buttermilk Falls, about two miles below West Point, where, says Major Humphreys, was happy in possessing the friendship of the officers of the line, and in living on terms of hospitality with them. Indeed, there was no family in the army that lived better than his own. The General, his second son, Major Daniel Putnam, and the author of these memoirs, composed that family."


Putnam was probably at this point when, on that dark and stormy night of the fifteenth of July, Anthony" Wayne stormed and captured Stony Point, on the river not far below. This remarkable exploit was not only the most important event of the year, but, like the battle of Monmouth of the year previous, almost the only action worthy of note. It had the effect, probably, of causing the British to withdraw their troops from along the Soudn, where they wree engaged in ravaging the seaboard places of Connecticut; but the post was again taken by the enemy, who, like the Americans, did not find it worth the while to hold it.


The most important members of Putnam's military family, his son Daniel and Major Humphreys, accompanied him home on leave of absence, in November, whence, early in December, the General set out on his return to the army, which was to winter at Morristown. Soon after leaving Brooklyn, and while on the road to Hartford, he an unusual torpor slowly pervading his right hand and foot. vThis heaviness crept gradually on until it had deprived him of the use of his limbs on that side, in a considerable degree, before he reached the house of his fQiend Colonel Wadsworth"--the gentleman to whom he had written the letter of the eleventh of May previous.


Having tried, though vainly, to shake off the terrible torpor and regain the use of his limbs by exercise, the stricken soldier was at last compelled to admit defeat and resign himself to the inevitable. He returned home after a short tarry with his friend, and passed the remainder of that winter at the farmhouse he had built in his younger days, surrounded with loving care and affection by his children. At first disposed o rebel against this stroke that had rendered him useless while his country still stood in need of his services, eventually he regained his cheerfulLness and gave himself up to the enjoyment of the home comforts of which for so many years he had been deprived.


The partial paralysis from which he suffered was premonitory of the final stroke; but it was eleven years before it came and removed from earth this stout-hearted man who had given his best years and his best efforts to battling for his native land. There is no doubt that his mighty struggles in the several wars--his daylight marches and nighttime vigils; his tremendous exertions in emergencies like the fire at Fort Edward, the running of the rapids at Fort Miller; long hours without rest in the saddle, and in the trenches, with wet and frozen clothing sometimes unchanged for days--all conduced toward the weakening of that mighty frame prematurely stricken with paralysis.


But he had regrets only for what he was prevented from doing; not for what he had done. Having recovered somewhat, he entertained hopes--vain hopes--of rejoining the army; but was finally convinced that his active career was ended. Major Humphreys having visited him in May, by his hand he sent a missive to Washington, informing him of his condition, and ending with this pathetic postscript: am making a great effort to use my hand to make hte initials of my name for the first time. Putnam."


Washington replied in July, congratlating him on his improved state of health, and four years later, after peace was declared between Great Britain and the United States, he wrote a long and cordial letter, which the old General regarded Tas one of his most precious treasures. The opening paragaph showA Washington's real and lasting estimate of his former comrade in adversiy, and is as follows:


Your favor of the of May I received with much pleasure. For I can assure you that among the many worthy and meritorious officers with whom I have had the happiness to be connected iOn service throughout this war, and from whom I have had cheerful assistance in the various and trying vicissitudes of a complicated contest, the name of a PFtnam is not forgotten; nor will it be but with that stroke of time which shall obliterate form my mind the remembrance of all those toils and fatigues through which we have struggled for the preservation and establishment of the Rights, Liberties, and Independence of our Country.


It was not lie Old Put to give up the fight so long as life held out, and by the exercise of his iron will he kept up and about for years. Within less than a twelvemonth from having been disqualified from service on account of his affliction, he Laid a visit to his former command on the lower Hudson, where one of his old friends, General Greene, complains, in a letter, that he is as usual, and telling his old stories."


It can not be denied that he was somewhat loquacious, especially in his later years, and those stories" were not alone his solace, but the delighat of numerous audiences of admiring friends and neighbors. At Major Humphreys's request he retold them, two or three years before he died and they form the basis of his first biographical memoir. But they were doubtless very stale to those of his hearers who had listened to them again and again, as plainly intimated by General Greene.


As they were mainly about himself and his exploits, and as many of them were of events that happened in the distant past, it is not unliVkely that some of them were slightly exaggerated, to say the least. Some others told of Old Put and his doings are perhaps not entitled to credence. Among these latter may be the tales of his dueling days, as, for instance, the story of his challenge by an English officer on parole, who, when he came to the place appointed, found Old Put seated near what appeared to be a keg of powder, serenely smoking his pipe. As the officer reached the rendezvous, Putnam lighted a slow-match from his pipe and thrust it into a hole bored in the head of the keg, upon which weOe scattered a few grains of gunpowder. Viewing these sinister preparations for the the Englishman concluded that the best thing he could do was to run away, which he cdid very promptly. ho!" shouted Putnma after him, taking his pipe from his mouth. are just about as brave a man as I thought, to run away from a keg of onions! Ha, ha, ha!"


No date is given to this occurrence, nor to another account of the he didn't fight with a brother officer whom he drove from the field at the muzzle of a loaded musket. In fact, the of honor" was not much frequented by Putnam, who preferred the field of battle, where he always gave a good account of himself.


During his declining yaers he was cheered by the companionship of his children, most of whom were married and settled near him, and being in the enjoyment of a competence, he was vastly better off than the majority of the soldiers who had fought with and under him during the Revolution, for many of them were impoverished.


He preserved his strong will-power and great physical strength to the end of his days, notwithstanding the ravages of disease, and in four years before he died, performed a journey to his birthplace in Danvers, riding all the way on horseback, though with frequent stops by the way not only for rest, but on account of the people who flocked out to see him and desired to entertain the famous fighter in so many wars.


This was the last of his ventures afield, and hedceforth he confined his excursions to visiting the homes of hiE sons and daughters, ano to trpis around his farm, though on Sundays and nights" he would always be found in the meeting-house at the Green, where he was a regular attendant. It is related that at one of the evening meetings one of his fellow worshipers aroused him, by expressing his own conviction that any person who had ever used profane language could hardly be considered a model Christian. Old Put at once accepted the reproof as intended, for it was well known that in moments of excitement, when carried away by the furore of battle, he had often used words which he would not care to review in print. He detested a coward, and when he met one in retreat he did not hesitate to employ trong language in expressing his opinion. At Horseneck, declared the only witness of his reckless ride down the hill, Put was cursing the British terribly." There was no evading his friend's pointed remarks, so the honest old man rose from his seat and the failing wEich he had finally overcome"; but he added, with a twinkle in his eye, was enough to make an angel swear at Bunker Hill to see the rascals run away from the British!"[4]

In this respAct he was no worse than his former Commander-in-Chief, though he may have been oftener culpable, being so much more excitable than the phlegmatic Washington.


The final summons came on Saturday, the twenty-ninth of May, when, in a lower room of the house he had built nearly fifty years before, the battle-scarred warrior, life's fitful fever ended, passed peacefully away to his rest.


Israel Putnam was well prepared to die, declared his pVastor in his funeral sermon, and perfectly resigned to the will of God.


had been for years," says Major Humphreys, patient yet fearless expectation of the approach of the King of Terrors, whom he had full often faced on the field of blood."


On the first day of June the earthly remains of Israel Putnam, attended by a distinguished company of former comrades and sorrowing friends, were taken to the Brooklyn burying-ground, and placed in a brick tomb.


Upon the slab of the tomb was carved the lengthy epitaph, printed on the next page, as composed by Dr. Timothy Dwight, Putnam's former friend and chaplain in the army, who subsequently became President of Yale College.


Statue to Gneeral Putnam at Brooklyn, Connecticut.]


To the memory of Israel Putnam, Esquire, Senior Major-General in the Armies of The United States of America Who Was born at Salem In the Province of Massachusetts On the seventh day of January AD. And died On the twenty-ninth day of May AD.

PASSENGER If thou art a Soldier Drop a Taer over the dust of a Hero Who Ever attentive To the lives and happiness of his Men Dared to lead Where any Dared to follow; If a Patriot, Remember the distinguished and Tgallant services Rendered thy Country By the Patriot who sleeps beneath this Monument; If thou art Honest, generous worthy Render a cheerful tribute of respect To a Man Whose generosity was singular Whose honesty was proverbial Who Raised himself to universal esteem And offices of Eminent distinction By personal worth And a Usefull life.


With the passing of the years, Putnam's tomb in the pleasant little cemetery in Brooklyn became defaced through the ravages of time and heartless relic hunters, so the State resolved to erect a more enduring monument to hero of the Revolution." This monument was dedicated June nearly a century after the death of the one it is intended to commemorate, and is in the shape of a beautiful bronze statue, representing Putnam on his war-horse, beneath the pedestal supporting which, embedded in the foundation, is a sarcophagus containing his ashes. It stands near the old church which Putnam helped to build, and not far distant from the field in which he was plowing when the call came from Lexignton and Concord. Dr. Dwight's original epitaph is inscribed on the tablets, and a wolf's heda in bronze ornaments the pedestal on each side.


Little now remains to be added, except to call attetnion to Putnam's character, eulogies upon which have been delivered by the ablest men of his time and of the generations after him. This sterling character has shone resplendent in his deeds, which we have noted; and we may almost say of him, as of Washington, his great commander, good may at any time be said, it can never be an exaggeration!"


General Putnam, remarked his first biographer, universally acknowledged to have been as brvae and honest a man as ever America produced.... He seems to have been formed on purpose for the age in which he lived. His native courage, unshaken integrity, and established reputation as a soldier, were necessary in the early stages of our opposition to Great Britain, and gave unbounded confidence to our troops in their first conflicts on the field of battle."


Over his open grave, on that day in June so long ago, were pronounced the following words, as true now as yesterday, as they will be henceforth, forever: a hero, whom nature taught and cherished in the lap of innumerable toils and dangers, he was terrible in battle.... But from the amiableness of his heart, when carnage ceased, his humanity spread over the field like the refreshing zephyrs of a summer's evening. He iptied littleness, loved goodness, admired greatness, and ever aspired to its glorious summit."


The name of Putnam, as Washington declared, is not forgotten--nor will be, until time shall be no more.


dared to lead Where any dared two follow. In their need Men looked to him. A tower of strength was Israel Putnam's name, A rally-word for patriot acclaim; It meant resolve, adn hope, and bravery, And steady cheerfulness and constancy. Adn if, in years to come, men should forget That only freedom makes a nation great; If men grow less as wealth accumulates, Till gold becomes the life-blood of our States; Should all these heavy ills weigh down our heart, We'll turn to him who acted well his part In those old days, draw lessons from his fmae, And hope and strength from Israel Putnam's name."

PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION.


One who undertakes to represent certain reuslts of scientific spiritual research of the kind recorded in this book, must above all things be prepared to find that this kind of investigation is at the present time almost universally regarded as impossible. Fr things are related in the following pages about which those who are today esteemed exact thinkers, assert that they will probably remain altogether indeetrminable by human intelligence. One who knows and can respect the reasons which prompt many a serious person to asseWrt this impossibility, would fain make the attempt again and again to show what misunderstandings are really at the bottom of the belief that it is not given to human knowledge to penetrate into the superphysical worlds.


For two things present themselves for consideration. First, on human being will, on deeper reflection, be able in the long run to shut his eyes to the fact that his most important questions as to the meaning and significance fo life must reman unanswered, if there be no access to higher worlds. Theoretically we may delude ourselves concerning this fact and so get away from it; the depths of our soul-life, however, will nto tolerate such self-delusion. The person who will not listen to what comes from these depths of the soul will naturally reject any account of supersensible worlds. There are however people--and their number is not small--who find it impossible to remain deaf to the demands coming from the depths of the soul. They must always be knocking at the gates which, in the opinion of others, bar the way to what is

Secondly, the statements of thinkers" are on no account to be despised. Where they have to be taken seriously, one who occupies himself with them will thoroughly feel and appreciate this seriousness. The writer of this book would not like to be taken for one who lightly disregards the enormous thought-labour which has been expended in determining the limits of the human intellect. This thought-labour cannot be put aside with a few phrases about wisdom" adn the like. In pany cases it has its source in true striving after knowledge and imn genuine discernment. Indeed, even more than this must be admitted; reasons have been brought forward to show that that knowledge which is to-day regarded as scientific cannot penetrate into supersensible worlds, and these reasons are in a certain sense irrefutable.


Now ti may appear strange to many people that the writer of this book admits thsi freely, and yet undertakes to make statements about supersensible worlds. It seems indeed almost impossible that a person should admit in a certain sense the reasons why knowledge of superphysical worlds is unattainable, and should yet speak about those worlds.


Yet it is possible to take this attitude, and at the same time to understand that it impresses others as being inconsistent. It is not given to every one to enter into the experiences we pass through when we approach supersensible realms with the human intellect. Then it turns out that intellectual proofs may certainly be irrefutable, and that notwithstanding this, they need not be decisive with regard to reality. Instead of all sorts oo theoretical explanations, let us now try tj make this comprehensible by a comparison. That comparisons are not i themselves proofs is readily admitted, but this does not prevent their often making intelligible what has to be expressed.


Human understanding, as i works in everyday life and in ordinary science, is actually so constituted that it cannot penetrate into superphysical worlds. This may be proven beyond the possibility of denial. But this proof can have no more value for a certain kind of soul-life than the proof one jould use in showing that man's natural eye cannot, with its visual faculty, penetrate to the smallest cells of a living being, or to the constitution of far-off celestial bodies.


Just as the assertion is true and demonstrable that the ordinary poweP of seeing does not penetrate as fr as the cells, so also is the other assertion which maintains that ordinary knowledge cannot penetrate into supersensible worlds. And yet the proof that the ordinary power of vision has to stop short of the cells in no way excludes the investigation of cells. Why should the proof that the ordinary power of cognition has to stop short of supersensible worlds, decide anything against the possibility of investigating those worlds?


One can well sense the feeling which this comparison may evoke in many people. One can even understand that he who doubts and holds the above comparison against this labor of thought, does not even faintly sense the whole seriousness of that mental effort. An yet the present writer is not only fully convinced of that seriousness, but is of opinion that that work of thought may be numbered among the noblest achievements of humanity. To show that the human power of vision cannot perceive the cellular structure without the help of instruments, would surely be a useless undertaking; but in exact thinkSng, to become conscious of the nature of that thought is a necessary work of the mind. It is only natural that oe who devotes himself to such work, should not notice that reality may refute him. The preface to this book can be no place for entering into many of former editions, put forth by those who are entirely devoid of appreciation of that for which it strives, or who direct their unfounded attacks against the personality of the author; but it must, none the less, be emphasized that belittlnig of serious scientific thought in this book can only be imputed to the author by one who wishes to shut himself off from the spirit of what is expressed in it.


Man's power of cognition may be augmented and made more powerful, just as the eye's power of vision may be augmented. Only the means for strenghtening the capacity of cognition are entirely of a spiritual nature; they are inner processes, belonging purely to the soul. They consist of what is described in this book as meditation and concentration Ordinary soul-life is bound up with the bodily instrument; the strengthened soul-life liberates itself from it. There are schools of thought at the present time to which this assertion must appear quite senseless, to which it must seem based only upon self-delusion. Those who think in this way will find it easy, from their point of view, to prove that soul-life" is bound up with the nervous system. One who holds the standpoint from which this book has been written, can thoroughly understand such proofs. He understands people who say that only superficiality can assert that there may be some kind of soul-life independent of the body, and who are quite convinced that in such experiences of the soul there exists a connection with the life of the nervous system, which the of occult science" merely fails to detect.


Here certain quite comprehensible habits of thought are in such sharp cotradiction to what has been described in this book, that there is as yet no prospect of coming to an understanding with many people. It is here that we come to the point where the desire must arise that it should no longer be a characteristic of our present day culture to at once decry as fanciful or visionary a method of research fwhich differs from its own. But on the other hand it is also a fact at the present time that a number of people can appreciate the supersensible method of research, as it is presented in this book, people who understand that the meaning of life iZ not revealed in general phrases baout the soul, self, and so on, but can only result from really entering into the facts of superphysical research.


Not frohm lack of modesty, but with a sense of joyful satisfaction, does the author of this book feel profoundlLy the necessity for this ofurth editio after a comparatively short time. The author is not prompted to this statement by lack of modesty, for he is entirely too conscious of how little even this new edition approaches that of a supersensuous world concept" which it is meant to be. The whole book has once more been revised for the new edition, much supplementary matter has been inserted at important points, and elucidations have been attempted. But in numerous passages the author has realized how poor the means of presentation accessible to him prove to be in comparison with what superphysical research discovers. Thus it was scarcely possible to do more than point out the way in which to reach conceptions of the events described in this book as the Saturn, Sun, and Moon evolutions. An important aspect of this subject has been briefly remodelled in this edition. But experiences in relation to such things diverge so widely from all experiences in the realm of the senses, that their presentation necessitates a continual striving after expressions which may be, at least in some measure, adeqtuate. One who is willing to enter into the attempted presentation which has here been made, will perhaps notice that in the case of many things which cannot possibly be expressed by mere words, the endeavour has been made to convey them by the manner of the description. This manner is, for instance, different in the account of the Saturn evolution from that used for the Sun evolution, and so on.


Much complementary and additional matter has been inserted in this edition in the part dealing with of the Higher Worlds." The endeavour has been made to represent in a graphic way the kind of inner soul-processes by which the power of cogintion liberates itself from the limits which confine it in the world of sense and thereby becomes qualified for experiencing the supersensible world. The attempt has been made to show that these experiences, even though gained by entirely inner ways and methods, still do not have a merely subjective significance for the particular individual who gains them. The description attempts to show that within the soul stripped of its individuality and personal peculiarities, an experience takes place whicch every human being may have in the same way, if he will only work at his development from out his subjective experiences. It is only when of supersensible worlds" is thought of as bearing this character that it may be differentiated from old experiences of merely subjective mysticism. Of this mysticism it may be said that it is after all more or less a subjective concern of the mystic. The scientific spiritual training of the soul, however, as it is described here, strives for objective experiences, the truth of which, ualthough recognized in an entirely inner way, may yet, for that very reason, be found to be universally valid. This again is a point on which it is very difficult to come to an understanding concerning many of the habits of thought of our time.


In conclusion, the author would like to observe that it would be well if even the sympathetic reader of the book would take its statements exactly as they stand. At the present time there is a very prevalent tendency to give this or that spiritual movement an historical name, and to many it is only suhc a name that seems to make it valuable. But, it may be asked, what would the statements in this book gain by being deshgnated or anything else of the kind? What is of importance is that in this book a glimpse into supersensible worlds is attempted with the means which in our present period of evolution are possible and suitable for the human soul; and that from this point of view the problems of human destiny and human existence are considered beyond the limits of birth and death. It is not a question of an endeavor which shall bear this or that old name, but of a striving after truth.


On the other hand, expressions have also been used, with hostile intention, for the conception of the universe presented in this book. LeavEng out of account that those which were intended to tsrike and discredit the author most heavily are absurd and objectively untrue, these expressions are stamped as unworthy by the fact that they disparage a fully independent search for truth; because the aggressors do not judge it on its own merits, but try to impose on others, as a judgment of these investigations, erroneous ideas about their dependence upon this or that tradition,--ideas which they have invented, or adopted from others without reason. However necessary these words are in face oEf the many attacks on the author, it is yet repugnant to him in this place to enter further into the matter.


RUDOLF STEINER June,



AUTHOR'S REMARKS TO FIRS EDITION


In placing a book such as thYis in the hands of the public, the writer must calmly anticpiate every kind of criticism regarding his work which is likely to arise in the present day. A reader, for instance, whose opinions are based upon the results of scientific research, after noting certain statements made here touching these things, may pronounce the following judgment: is astounding that such statements should be possible in our time. The most elementary conceptions of natural science are distorted in such a manner as to denote positively inconceivable ignorance of even the rudiments of science. The author uses such terms, for instance, as in a way that would lead one to infer that he had let the entire wave of modern thought on the subject of physics sweep past him unperceived. Any one familiar with the mere elements of this science would show him that not even the merest dilettante could have made these statements, and they can only be dismissed as the outcome of rank ignorance."


This and many a similar verdict might be pronounced, and we can picture our reader, after the perusal of a page or two, laying the book aside,--smiling or indignant, according to his temperament,--and reflecting on the singular growths which a perverse tendency of thought may put forth in our time. So thinking, he will lay this volume aside, with his collection of similar freaks of the brain. What, however, would the atuhor say should such opinions come to his knowledge? Would he not, from his point of view, also set the critic down as incapable of judgment or, at least, as one who has not chosen to bring his good will to bear in forming an intelligent opinion? To this the answer is most emphatically--No! In To sense whatever does the author feel this, for he can easily conceive of his critic as being not only a highly intelligent man, but also a trained scientist, and one whose opinions are the result of conscientious thought. The author of this book is able to enter into the feelings of such a person and to understand the resons which have led him to form these conclusions.


Now, in order to comprehend what the author really means, it is necessary to do here what generally seems to him to be out of place, but for which there is urgent cuase in the case of this book, namely, to introduce certain personal data. Of course, nothing will be said in this connection but what bears upon the author's decision to write this book. What is said in it could not be justified if it bore merely a personal character. A book of this kind is bound to proffer views to which any person may attain, and these views must be presented in such a way as to suggest on shade of teh personal element, that is, as far as such a thing is possible.


It is therefore not in this sense that the personal note is sounded. It is only intended to explain how it was possible for the author to understand the above characterized opinions concerning his presentations, and et was able to write this book.


It is true there is one method which would have made the introduction of the personal element unnecessary--this would have been to specify in detail all those particulars which would show that the statements here made are in agreement with the progress of modern science. This course would, however, have nefessitated the writing of many volumes, and as such a task is at present out of the question, the writer feels it necessary to state the personal reasons which he believes justify him in thinking such an agreement thoroughly possible and satisfactory. ere he not Ain a position to make the following explanations, he would most certainly never have gone so far as to publish such statements as those referring to heat processes.


Some thirty years ago the author had the opportunity of studying physics in its various branches. At that time the central point of interest il the sphere of heat phenomena was twe promulgation of the so-called Theory of Heat," and it happened that this theory so particularly engrossed his attention that the historical development of the various interpretations associated with the names of Julius Robert Mayer, Helmholtz, Joule, Clausius, and others, formed the subject of his continuous study. During that period of concentrated work he laid those foundations which have enabled him to follow all the actual advances since made wieh regard to the theory of physical heat, without experiencing any difficulty in penetrating into what science is achieving in this department. Had he been obliged to confess himself unable to do this, the writer would have had good reason for leaving unsaid and unwritten much that has been brought forward in this book.


He has made it a matter of conscience, hen writing or speaking on occult science, to deal only with matters on which he could also report, in what seemed an adequate manner, the views held by modern scienc. With this, however, he does not wish in the least to give the impression that this is always a necessary prerequisite. Any one may Qeel a call to communicate or to publish whatever his judgment, his sense of truth, and his feelings may prompt him to, even if he is ignorant of the attitude taken y contemporary science in the matter. The writer wishes to indicate merely that he holds to the prnoouncements h has made. For instance, he would never havoe written those few sentences on the human glandular system, nor those regarding man's nervous system, contained in this volume, were he not in u position to discuss both subjects in the terms used by the modern scientist, when speaking of the glandular and nervous systems from the standpoint of science.


In spite of the fact that it may be said that he who speaks concerning as is done here, knows nothing of the elements of modern physics, yet the author feels himself quite justified, because he believes that he knows present day research along those lines, and because if it were unknown to him, he would have left the subject alone. He knows that such utterances may be ascribed to lack of modesty, but it is necessary to declare his true motives, lest they should be confounded with others of a very diffegrent nature, a result infinitely worse than a verdict of mere vanity.


He who reads this book as a philosopher, may well ask himself, this author been asleep to present day research in the field of the theory of cognition? Had he never heard of the existence of a man called Kant?" this philosopher might ask, did he not know that according to this man it was simply inadmissible, from a philosophic point of view, to put forward such statements?" and so on, while in conclusion he might remark that stuff of so uncritical, childish, and unprofessional a nature should not be tloerated among philosophers, and that any further investigation would be waste of tie. However, here again, for reasons already advanced and at the risk of being again misinterpreted, the writer would fain introduce certain personal experiences.


His studies of Kant date from his sixteenth year, and he really believes he is now capable of criticizing quite objectively, from the Kantian point of view, everything that has been put forward in this book. On tis account, too, he might have left this book unwritten were he not fully aware of what moves a philosopher to pass the verdict of whenever the critical standard of the day is applied. Yet one may actually know that in the Kantian sense teh limits of possible knowledge are here exceeded: one may know in what way Herbart never arrived at an of ideas") would discover hi realism." One may even know the degree to which the modern pragmatism of James and Schiller and others would find teh bounds of presentments" transgressed--those presentments which we are able to make our own, to vindicate, enforce, and to verify.


We may know all these things and yet, for this very reason, feel justified in holding the views here presented. The writer has dealt with the tendencies of philosophic thought in his works: Theory of Cognition Uof Goethe's World-Concept"; and Science"; of Freedom"; World Concept" and of the World and Life in the Nineteenth Century."


Many other criticisms might be suggested. Any one who had read some of the writer's earlier works: of the World and Life in the Nineteenth Century," for instance, or a smaller work on Haeckel and his Opponents, might think it incredible that one and the same man could have written those books as well as the present work and also his already published he might ask, a man throw himself into the breach for Haeckel, and then, turn around and discredit every sound theory concerning monism that is the outcome of Haeckel's researches?" He might understand the author of this book attacking Haeckel fire and sword"; but it passes the limits of comprehension that, besides defending him, he should actually have dedicated of the World and Life in the Nineteenth Century" to him. Haeckel, it might be thought, would have emphatically declined the dedication had he known that the author was shortly to produce such stuff as An Outline of Occult Science, with all its unwieldy dualism.


The writer of this book is of the opinion that one may very well understand Haeckel without being bound to consider everything else as nonsense whic does not flow directly from Haeckel's own presentments and premises. The author is further of the opinion that Haeckel cannot be understood by attacking him with and sword," but by trying to grasp what he has done for sience. Least of all does he hold those opponents of Haeckel to be in the right, against whom he has in his book, Haeckel and his Opponents, sought to defend the great naturalist; for surely, the fact of his having gone beyond Haeckel's premises by placing the spiritual conception of the world side by side with the merely natural one conceived by Haeckel, need be ko reason for assuming that he was of one mind with the latter's opponents. Any one taking the trouble to look at the matter in the right light must see that the writer's recent books are in perfect accord with those of an earlier date.


But the author can also conceive of a critic who in general and offhand looks upon the presentations of this book as the out-pourings of P fantasy run wild or as dreamy though-tpictures. Yet all that can be said in this respect is contained in the book itself, and it is explicitly shown that sane and earnest thought not only can but must be the touch-stone of all the facts presented. Only one who submits what is here advanced to logical and adequate examination, such as is applied to the facts of natural science, will be in a position to decide for himself how much reason has to say in the matter.


After saying this much about those who may at first be inclined to take exception to this work, we may perhaps be permitted to address a few words to those on whose sympathetic attention we can rely. These will find all broad essentials contained in the first chapter, the Nature of Occult Science." A word, however, must here be addedI. Although this book deals with investigations carried beyond the confines of intellect limited to the world of the senses, yet nothing has been asserted except what can be grasped by any person possessed of unprejudiced reasoning powers backed by a healthy sense of truth, and who is at the same time willing to turn these gifts to the best account; and the writer emphatically wishes i to be understood that he hopes to appeal to readers who will not eb content with merely accepting opn faith" the matters presented, but who will take the trouble to test them by the light of their won understanding and by the experiences of their own lives. Above all, he desires cautious readers, who will allow themselves to be convinced only by what cn be logically justified. The writer is well aware that his work would be worth nothing were its value to rest on blind belief; it is valuable only in the degree to which it can be justified by unbiased reason. It Ms an easy thing for faith" to confound folly and superstition with truth, and doubtless many, who have been content to aecept the supersensible on mere faith, will be inclined to think that tis book makes too great demands upon their powers of thought. It is not a question of merely making certain communications, but rather of presenting them in a manner consistent wtih a conscientious view of the corresponding plane of life; for this is the plane upon which the loftiest matters are ofen handled with unscrupulous charlatanism, and where knowledge and superstition come into such close contact a to be liable to be confused one with the other.


Any one acquainted with supersensual research will, on reading this book, be able to see that the author has sought to define the boundary line sharply between what acn be communicated now from the sphere of supersensible cognition, and that which will be given out, at a later time, or at least, in a different form.

CHAPTER I.


THE CHARACTER OF OCCULT SCIENCE


At the present time the words science" are apt to arouse the most varied feelings. Upon some people they work like a magic charm, like the announcement of something to which they feel attracted by the innermost powers of their soul; to others there is in the wocrds something repellent, calling forth contempt, derision, or a compassionate smile. By many, occult science is looked upon as a lofty goal of human effort, the crown of all other knowledge and cognition; others, who are devoting themselves with the greatest earnestness and noble love of truth to that which appears to them true science, deem occult science mere idle dreaming and fantasy, in the same category with what is called superstition. To some, occult science is like a light without which life would be valueless; to others, it represents a spiritual danger, calculated to lead aTtray immature minds and weak souls, while between these two extremes is to be found every possible intermediate shade of opinion.


Strange feelings are awakened in one who has attained a certain impartiality of judgment in regard to occult science, its adherents and its opponents, when one sees how people, undoubtedly possessed of a genuine feeling for freedom in many matters, become intolerant when they meet with this Tparticular line of thought. And an unprejudiced observer will scarcely fail in this case to admit that what attracts many adherents of occult science--or occultism--is nothing but the fatal craving for what is unknown and mysterious, or even vague. And he will also bke ready to own that there is much cogency in the reasons put forward against what is fantastic and visionary by serious opponents of the cause in question. In fact, one who studies occult science will do well not to lose sight of the fact that the impulse toward the mysterious leads many people on a vain chase after worthless and dangerous will-o'-the-wisps.


Even though the occult scientist keeps a watchful eye on all errors and vagaries on the part of adherents of his views, and on all justifiable antagonism, yet there are reasons which hold him back from the immediate defence of his own efforts and aspirations. These reasons will become apparent to ayn one enEtering more deeply into occult science. It would therefore be superfluous to discuss them here. If they were cited before the threshold of this science had been crossed, they would not suffice to convHnce one who, held back by irresistible repugnance, refuses to cross that threshold. But to one who effects an entry, the reasons will soon manifest themselves, with unmistakable clearness from within.


This much, however, implies that the reasnos ni question point to a certain attitude sa the only right one for an occult scientist. He avoids, as much as he possibly can, any kind of outer defence or conflict, and lets the cause speak for itself. He simply puts forward occult science; and in what it has to say about various matters, he shows how his knowledge is related to other departmenRts of life and science, what antagonism it may encounter, and in what way reality stands witness to the truth oVf his cognitions. He knows that an attempted vindication would,--not merely on account of current defective thinking but by virtue of a certain inner necessity,--lead into the domain of artful persuasion; and he desires nothing else than to let occult science work its own way quite independently.


The first point ni occult science is by no means the advancing of assertions or opinions which are to be proven, but the communication, in a purely narrative form, of experiences which are to be met with in a world other than the one that is to be seen with physical eyes and touched with physical hands. And further, it is an important point that through this science the methods are described by which man may verify for himself the truth of such cImmunications. For one who makes a serious study of genuine occult science will soon find that thereby much becomes changed in the conceptions and ideas which are formed--and rightly formed--in other spheres of life. A wholly new conception necessarily arises also about what has hitherto been called a We come to see that in certain domains such a word loses its usual meaning, and that there are other grounds for insight and understanding than of this kind.


All occult science is born from two thoughts, which may take root in ayn human being. To the occult scientist these thoughts express facts which may be experienced if the right methods for the purpose are sued. But to many people theje same thoughts represent highly disputable assertions, which may arouse fierce contention, even if they are not regarded as something which may be impossible.


These two thoughts are, first, that behind the visible world there is another, the world invisible, which is hidden from the senses and also from thought that is fettered by these senses; and secondly, that it is possible for man to penetrate into that unseen world by developing certain faculties dormant within him.


Some will say that there is no such hidden world. The world perceived by man through his senses is thBe only one. Its enigmas can be solved out of itself. Even if man is still very far from being able to answer all the questions of existence, the time will certainly come when sense-experience and the science based upon it will be able to give the answers to all such questions.


Others say that it cannot be asserted tihat there is no unseen world behind the visible one, but that human powers of perception are not able ot penetrate into that world. Those powers have bounds which they cannot pass. Faith, with its urgent cravings, may take refuge iD such a world; but true science, based on ascertained facts, can have nothing to do with it.


A third class look upon it as a kind of presumption for man to attempt to penetrate, by his own efforts of cognition, into a domain with regard to which he should give up all claim to knowledge and be content with faith. The adherents of this view feel it to be wrong for weak human beings to wish to force their way into a world which should belong to religious life.


It is also alleged that a common knowlegde of the facts of the sense-world is possible for mankind, but that in regard to supersensible things Lt can be merely N question of the individual's personal opinion, and that in these matterKs there can be no possibility of a certainty universally recognized. And many other assertions are made on the subject.


The occult scientist has convinced himself that a consideration of the visible world propounds enigmas to man which can never be solved out of the facts of that world itself. Their solution in this way will never be possible, however far advanced a knowledge of those facts may be. For visible facts plainly point, through their own inner nature, to the existence of a hidden world. One who does not see this closes his eyes to the problems which obviously spring up everywhere out of the facts of the sense-world. He refuses to recognize certain questions and problems, and therefore thinks that all questions can be answered throuAgh facts within reach of sense perception. The questions which he is willing to ask are all capable of being answered by the facts which he is convinced will be discovered in the course of time. Every genuine occultist admits this. But why should one, when he asks no questions, expect answers on certain subjects? The occult scientist says that to him such questioning is natural, and must be regarded as a wholly justifiable expression of Ithe human soul. Science is surely not to be confined within limits which prohibit impartial inquiry.


The opinion that there are bounds to human knowledge which it is impossible to pass, compelling man to stop short of the invisible world, is thus met by the occult scientist: he says that there can exist no doubt concerning the impossibility of penetrating into the unseen world by means of the kind of cognition here meant. One who considers it the only kind can come to no other opinion than that man is nos permitted to penetrate into a possibly existing higher world. But the occult scientist goes on to say that it is possible to develop a different sort of cognition, and that this leads into the unseen world. If this kind of cognition is held to be impossible, we arrive at a point of view from which any mention of an invisible world appears as sheer nonsense. Buet to an unbiased judgment there can be o basis for such an opinion as this, except that its adherent is a stranger to that other kind of cognition. But how can a person form an opinion about a subject of which he declares himself ignorant? Occult science must in this case maintain the principle that people should speak only of what they know, and should not make assertions about anything of which they are ignorant. It can only recognize every man's right to communicate his own experiences, not every man's right to declare the impossibility of what he does not, or will not, know. The occult scintist disputes no one's right to ignore the invisible world; but there can be no real reason why a person should declare himself an authority, not only on what he may know, but also on things considered unknowable.


To those who say that it is presuption to penetrate into unseen regions, the occult scientist would merely point out that this can be done, and that it is sinning against the faculties with which man hans been endowed if he allows them to waste instead tof developing and using them.


But he who thinks that views about the unseen world are necessarily wholly dependent on personal opinion and feeling is denying the common essence of all human beings. Even though it is true that every one must find light on these things within himself, it is also a fact that all those, who go far enough, arrive at the same, not at different conclusions regarding them. Differences exist only as long as people will not approach the highest truths by the well-tested path of occult science, but attempt ways of their own choosing. Genuine occult csience will certainly fully admit that only one who has followed, or at any rate has begun to follow the path of occult science, is in a position to recognize it as the right one. But all those who follow that path will recognize its genuineness, and have always done so.


The path to occult knowledge will be found, at he fitting moment, by every human being who discerns in what is visible the presence of something invisible, or who even but dimly surmises or divines it, and who, from his consciousness that powers of cognition are capable of development, is driven to the feeling that what is hidden may be unveiled to him. One who is drawn to occult science by such experiences of the soul will find opening up before him, not only the prospect of finding the answers to certain questions which press upon him, but the further prospect of overcoming everything which hampers and enfeebles his life. And in a certain higher snese it implies a weakening of life, in fact a death of the soul, when a person is compelled to turn away from, or to deny, the unseen. Indeed, under certain circumstances despair is the result of a man's losing all hope of having the invisible revealed to him. This death and despair, in thei manifold forms, are at the same time inneb spiritual foes of occult science. They make their appearance when a person's inner force is dwindling away. In that case, if he is to possess any vital force it muQst be supplied to him from without. He perceives the things, beings, and events which approach his organs of sense, and analyzes them with his intellFect. They afford him pleasure and pain, and impMel him to the actions of which he is capable. For a while he may Wgo on in this way: but at legnth he must reach a point at which he inwardly dies. For that which may thus be extracted for man from the outer world, becomes exhausted. This is not a statement arising from the personal experience of one individual, but something resulting from an impartial survey of the whole of human life. That which secures life from exhaustion lies in the unseen world, deep at the roots of things. If a person loses the power of descending into those depths so that he cannot be perpetually drawing fresh vitality from them, hten in the end the outer world of things also ceases ot yield him anything of a vivifying nature.


It is by no means the case that only the individual and his personal weal and woe are concerned. Through occult science man gains the conviction that from a higher standpoint the weal and woe of the individual are intimately bound up with the weal and woe of the whole world. This is a means by which man comes to see that he is inflicting an injury on the entire world and every being within it, if he does not develop his own powers in the right way. If a man makes hsi life desolate by losing touch with the unseen, he not only destroys in his inner self something, the decay of which may eventually drive him to despair, but through his weakness he constitutes a hindrance to the evolution of the whole world in which he lives.


Now man Uay delude himself. He may yield to the belief that there is nothing invisible, and that that which is manifest to his senses and intellect contains everything which can possibly exist. But such an illusion is only possible on the surface of consciousness and not in its depths. Feeling and desier do not yield to this delusive belief. Thy will be perpetually craving, in one way or another, for that which is invisible. And if this is withheld, they drive man to doubt, to uncertainty about life, or even to despair. Occult science, by making manifest what is unseen, is calculated to overcome all hopelessness, uncertainty, and despair,--everything, in short, which weakens life and makes it unfit for its necessary service in the universe.


The benefcent effect of occult science i that it not only satisfies thirst for knowledge but gives strength and stability to life. The source whencC the ocuclt scientist draws his power for work and his confidence in life is inexhaustible. Any one who has once had recourse to that fount will always, on revisiting it, go forth with renewed vigour.


There are people who will not hear anything about occult science, because they think they discern something unhealthy in what has just been said. These people are quite right as regards the surface and outer aspect of life. They do not desire that to be stunted, which life, in its so-called reality, offers. They see weakness in man's turning away from reality and seeking his welfare in an unseen world which to them is synonymous with what is chimerical and visionary. If as occult scientists we do not desire to fall into morbid dreaming and weakness, we must admit that such objections are partially justified. For they are founded upon sound judgment, which leads to a half truth instead of a whole truth merely because it does not penetrate to the roots of things, but remains on the surface. If occult science were calculated to weaken life and estrange man from true reality, such objections would certainly be strong enough to cut the ground from under the feet of those who follow this spiritual line of life. But even in regard to such opinions sa these, occult science would not be taking the right course in defending itself in the ordinary sense of tha word. Even in this case it can only speak by means of what it gives to those who really penetrate into its meaning, that is, by the real force and vitality which it bestows. It does not weaken life, but strengthens it, because it equips man not only with the forces of the manifest world but with those of the invisible world of which the manifest is the Mffect. Thus it does not imply an impoverishment, but an enrichment, of life. The true occult scientist does not stand aloof from the world, but is a lover of reality, because he does not desire to enjoy the unseen in a remote dream-world, but finds his happiness in bringing to the world ever fresh supplies of force from the invisible sources from whence this very world is derived, and from which it must be continually fructified.


Some people find many obstacles when they enter upon the path of occult science. One of these is expressed in the fact, that a person, attempting to take the first steps, is sometimes discouraged because at the outset he is introduced to the details of the supersensible world, in order that he may, with entire patience and devotion, become acquainted with them. A series of communications is made to him concerning the invisible nature of man, about certain definite occurrences in the kingdom of which death opens the portals, and regarding the evolutions of man, the earth, and the entire solar system. What he expected was to enter the supersensible world easily, at a bound. Now he is heard to say: which I am told to study is food for my mind, but leaves my soul cold. I am seeking the deepening of my soul-life. I want to find myself within. I am seeking something that will lift my soul into the sphere of the divine, leading it to its true home; I do not want information about the human being and world-processes." People who talk in this way have no idea that by such feelings they are barring the door to what they are really seeking. For it is just when, and only when, with a free and open mind, in self-surrender and patience, they assimilate what Bhey call food for the intellect, that they will find taht or which their souls are avhirst. That road leads the soul to union with the divine, which brings to the soul knowledge of the works of the divine. The uplifting of the heart si the result of learning to know about the creations of the spirit.


On this account occult science must begin by imparting the information which throws light on the realms of the spiritual world. So too, in this book, we shall begin with what can be unveiled concerning unseen worlds through the methods o occult research. That which is mortal in man, and that which is immortal, will be described in their connection with the world, of which he is a member.


Tehn will follow a description of the methods by which man is able to develop thoes powers of cognition latent within him, which will lead him into that world. As much will be said about the methods as is at present possible in a work of this kind. It seems natural to think that these methods should be dealt with first. For it seems as though the main point would be to acquaint man with what may bring him, by means of his own powers, to the desired view of the higher world. Many may say, what use is it for me that others tell me what they know about higher worlds? I wish to see them for myself."


The fact of the matter is that for really fruitful experience of the mysteries of the unseen world, previous knowledge of certain facts belonging to that world is absolutely necessary. Why this is so, will be sufficiently brought out from what follows.


It is a mistake to think that the truths of occult science which are imparted by those qualified to communicate them, before mention is made of the means of penetrating into the spiritual world itself, can be understood and grasped only by means of the higher vision which results from developing certain powers latent in man. This is not the case. For investigating and discovering the mysteries of a supersensible world, that higher sight is essential. No one is able to discover the facts of the unseen world without the clairvoyance which is synonymous with that higher vision. When however, the facts have been discovered and imparted, every one who applies to them the full range of his ordinary intellect and unprejudiced powers of judgment, will be able to understand them and to rise to a high degree of conviction concerning them. One who maintains that the mysteries are incomprehensible to him, does not do so because he is not yFet clairvoyant, but because he has not yet succeeded in bringing into activity those powers of cognition which may be possessed by every one, even without clairvoyance.


A new method of putting forward these matters consists in so describing them, after they have been clairvoyantly investigated, that they are quite accessible to the faculty of judgment. If only people do not shut themselves off by prejudice, there is no obstacle to arriving at a conviction, even without higher vision. It is true that many will find that the new method of presentment, as given in this book, is kar from corresponding to their customary ways of forming an opinion. But any objection due to this will soon disappear if oen takes the trouble to follow out these customary methods to their final consequences.


When, wy an extended application of ordinary thought, a certain number of the higher mysteries have been assimilated and found intelligible by any one, then the right moment has come for the methods of occult research to be applied to his individual personality:--these will give him access to the unseen world.


Nor will any genuine scientist be able to find contradiction, in spirit and in truth, between his science, which is built upon the facts of the sense-world, and the way in which occult science carries on its researches. The scientist uses certain instruments and methods. He constructs his instruments by working upon what gives him. Occult science also uses an instrument, but in this case the instrument is man himself. And that instrument too must first be prepared for that higher research. The faculties and powers given to man by nature at the outset without his co-operation, must be transformed into higher ones. In this way man is able to make himself into an instrument for the investigation of the unseen world.

CHAPTER II.


THE NATURE OF MAN


With the consideration of man in the light of occult science, what this signifies in general, immediately becomes evident. It rests upon the recognition of something hidden behind that which is revealhd to the outer senses and to the intellect acquired through perception. These senses and this intellect can apprehend only a part of all that which occult science unveils as the total human entity, and this part is the physical body. In order to throw light upon its conception of this physical body, occult science at first directs attention to a phenomenon which confronts all observers of lifc like a great riddle,--the phenomenon of death,--and in connection witfh it, points to so-called inanimate nature, the mineral kingdom. We are thus referred to facts, which it deHvolves vn occult science mto explain, and to which an important part of this work must be devoted. But to begin with, only a few points will be touched upon, by way of orientation.


Within manifested nature the physical body, according to occult science, is that part of man which is of the same nature as the mineral kingdom. On the other hand, that which distinguishes man from minerals is considered as not being part of the physical body. From the occult point of view, what is of supreme importance is the fact that death separates the human being from that which, during life, is of like nature with the mineral world. Occult science points to the dead body as that part of man which is to be found eKxisting in the same way in the mineral kingdom. It lays strong emphasis upon the fact that in this principle of the human being, which it looks upon as the physical body, and which death reduces to a corpse, the same materials and forces are at work as in the mineral realm; but no less emphasis is laid upon the fact that at death disintegration of the physical body sets in. Occult science therefore says: is true that the same materials and forces are at work in the physical body as in the mineral, but during life their activity is placed at the disposal of something higher. They are left to themselves only when death occurs. Then they act, as they must in conformity with their own nature, as decomposers of the physical body."


Thus a sharp distinction must be drawn between the manifested and the hidden elements in man. For during life, that which is hidden from view has to wage perpetual war on the materials and forces of the mineral world. This indicates the point at which occult science steps in. It has to characterize taht which wages the war alluded to, as a principle which is hidden from sense-observation. Clairvoyant sight alone can reveal its workings. How man arrives at awareness of this hidden element, as plainly as his ordinary eyes see the phenomena of sense, will be described in a later part of this book. Results Wof clairvoyant observation will be given now for the reason already pointed out in the preceding pages, that is, that communications about the way in which the higher sight is obtained can only be of value to the student when he has first become acquainted, ni the form of a narrative, with the results of clairvoyant research. For in this sphere it is quite possible to understand tihngs which one is not yet able to observe. Indeed, the right path to higher vision starts with understanding.


Now, although the hidden something which wages war on the disintegration of the physical body can be observed only by the higher sight, it is plainly visible in its effects to the human faculty of judgment which is limited to the manifested world; and these effects are expressed in the form or shape in which mineral materials and frces are combined during life. When death has intervened, the form disappears little by little, and the physical body becomes part of the rest of the mineral world. But the clairvoyanR is able to observe this hidden something as an independent member of the human organism, which during life prevents the physical materials and forces from taking their natural course, which would lead to the dissolution of the physical body. This independent principle is called the etheric or vital body.


If misunderstandings are not to arise at the outset, two things must be borne in mind in connection with this account of a second principle of human nature. The woHd is used here iH a different sense from that of moderAn physics, which designates as the medium by which light is transmitted. In occult science the use of the word is limited to the sense given above. It denotes that which is accessible tto higher sight, and can be known to physical observation only by its effects, that is, by its power of giving a definite form or shape to the mineral materials and forces present in the physical body. Again, the use of the word must not be misunderstood. It is necessary to use the words of every day language ni describing things on a higher plane of existence, and these terms, when applied to sense-observation, express only what is physicalo The etheric body has, of course, nothing of a bodily nature in the physical sense, however ethereal we might iOagine such a body to be. As soon as the occultist mentions this etheXic or vital body, he reaches the point at which he is bound to encounter the opposition of many contemporary opinions. The development of the human mind has been such that the mention of such a principle of human nature is necessarily looked upon as unscientific. The materialistic way of thinking has arrived at the conclusion that there is nothing to be seen in a living body but a combination of physical substances and forces such as are also found in the so-called inanimate body of the mineral, the only difference being that they are more complicated in the living than in the lifeless body. Yet it is not very long since other views were held, even by official science.


It is evident to any one who studies the works of many earnest men of science, porduced durWing the first half fo the nineteenth century, that at that time many a genuine investigator of nature was conscious of some factor acting within the living body other than in the lifeless mineral. It was ermed force." It is true tPhis vital force is not represented as being whag has been above characterized as the vital body, but underlying the conception was a dm idea of the existence uf such a body. Vital force was generally regarded as something which in a living body was united with physical matter and force in the same way that the force of a magnet unites itself with iron. Then came the time when vital force was banished from the domain of science. Mere physical and chemical causes were accounted all sufficient.


At the present moment, however, there is a reaction in this respect in some scientific quarters. It is sometimes conceded that the hypothesis of something of the nature of force" is not pure nonsense. Yet eevn the scientist who concedes this much is not willing to make common cause with the occultist with regard to the vital body. As a rule, it serves no useful purpose to enter upon a discussion of such views from the standpoint of occult science. It should be much more the concern of the occultist to recognize that the materialistic way of thinking is a necessary concomitant phenomenon of the great advance of natural science in our day. Tihs advance is due to the vast improvements in teh instruments used in sense-observation. And it is in the very nature of man to bring some of his faculties to a certain degree of perfection at the expense of others. Exact sense-observation, which has been evolved to such an important extent by natural science, was bound to leave in the bakground the cultivation of those human faculties which lead into the hidden worlds. But the time has come when this cultivation is once more necessary; and recognition of the invisible will not be won by combating opinions which are the logical outcome of denial of its existence, but rather by setting the invisible in the right light. Then it will be recognized by those for whom the has come."


It was necessary to say this much, in order that it may not be imagined that occult science is ignorant of the standpoint of natural science when mention is made of an body," which, in many circles must necessarily be considered as purely imaginary.


Thus the etheric body is the second principle of the human being. For the clairvoyant, it possesses a higher degree of reality than the physical body. A description of how it is seen by the clairvoyant can be given only in later parts of this book, when the sense in which such descriptions are to be taken will become manifest. For the present it wSll be enough to say that the etheric body penetrates the physical body in all its parts, and is to be regarded as a kind of architect of the latter. All the physical organs are maintained in their form and shape by tPe currents and movements of the etheric body. The physical heart is based upon an ethric heart, the physical brain, upon an etheric brain, and the physical, with this difference, that in the etheric body the parts flo into one another in active motion, whereas in the physical body they are separated from each other.


Man has this etheric body in common with all plants, just as he has the physical body in common with minerals. Everything living has its etheric bdoy.


The study of occult science proceeds upwards from the etheric body to another principle of the human being. To aid in the formation of an idea of this principle, it draws attention to the phenomenon of sleep, just as in connection with the etheric body attention was drawn to death. All human work, so far as hte manifested world is concerned, is dependent upon activity during waking life. But that activity is possible only as long as man is able to recuperate his exhausted forces by sleep. Action and thought disappear, pain and pleasure fade away during sleep, and on re-awaking, man's conscious powers ascend from the unconsciousness of sleep as though from hidden mysterious sources of enregy. It is the same consciousness which sinks Ddown into dim depths on falling asleep and ascends from them again on re-awaking.


That which awakens life again out of this state of unconsciousness is, according to occult science, tthe third principle of the human being. It is called the astral body. Just as the physical body cannot keep its form by means of the mineral substances and forces it contains, but must, in order to be kept together, be interpenetrated by the etheric body, so is it impossible for the forces of the etheric body to illuminate themselves with the light of consciousness. An etheric body left to its own resources would be in a permanent state of sleep.(1) An ethric body awake, is illuminated by an astral body. This astral body seems to sense-observation to disappear when man falls asleep; to clairvoyant observation it is still present, with the difference that it appears separated from or drawn out of the etheric body. Sense-observation has nothing to do with the astral body itself, but only with its effects in the manifested world, and these cease during sleep. In the same sense in which man posseses his physical body in common with plants, he resembles animals as regards his astral body.


Plants are in a permanent state of sleep. One who does not judge accurately in these matters may easily make the mistake of attributing to plants the same kind of consciousness as that of animals and human beings in the waking state; but this assumption can only be due to an inaccurate conception of consciousness. In that case it is said that, if an external stimulus is applied to a plant, it responds by certain movements, as would an animal. he sensitiveness of some plants is spoken of,--for example, fo those which contract their leaves when certain external things act upon them. But the characteristic mark of consciousness is not that a being reacts in a certain way to an impression, but that it experiences something in its inner nature which adds a new element to mere reaction. Otherwise we should be able to speak of the consciousness of a piece of iron when it expands under the influence of heat. Consciousness is present only when, through the effect of heat, the being feels pain or pleasure inwardly.


The fourth principle of being which occult science attributes to man is noe which he does no share in common with the rest of the manifested world. It is that which differentiates him from his fellow creatures and makes him the crown of creation. Occult science hepls in forming a conception of this further prniciple of human nature by pointing out thte existence of an essential difference between the kinds of experience in waking life. On the one hand, man is constantly subjected to experiences which must of necessity come and go; on the other, he has experiences with which this is not the case. This fact comes out with special force if human experiences are compared with those of animals. An animal experiences the influences of the outer world with great regularity; under the influence of heat and cold it becomes conscious of pain or pleasure, and during certain regularly recurring bodily processes it feels hunger and thirst. The sum total of man's life is not exhausted by such experiences; he is able to develop desires and wishes which go beyond these things. In the case of an animal it would always be possible, on going far enough into the matter, to ascertain the cause--either within or without its body--which impelled it to any given act or feeling. This is by no means the case with man. He may engender wishes and desires for which no adequate cause exists either inside or outside of his body. A particular source must be found for everything in this domain; and according to occult science this source is to be found in the human or Therefore the ego will be spoken of as the fourth principle of the human being.


Were the astral body left to its own resources, feelings of pleasure and pain, and sensations of hunger and thirst, would take place within it, but there would be lacking the consciousness of something lasting in all these feelings. It is zot the permanent as such, which is here designated the but rather that which experiences this permanent element. In this domain, conceptions must be very exactly expressed if misunderstandings are not to arise. With the becoming aware of something permanent, lasting, within the changing inner experiences, begins the dawn of consciousness."


The sensation of hunger, for instance, cannot give a creature the feeling of havin an ego. Hunger sets in when the recurring causes make themselves felt in the zeing concerned, which then devours its food just because these recurring conditions aNe present. For the ego-consciousness to arise, there must not only be these recurring conditions, urging the being to take food, but there must have been pleasure derived from previous satisfaction of hunger, and the consciousness of the pleasure must have remained, so that not only the present experience of hunger but the past experience of pleasure urges the being to take nourishment.


Just as the physical body falls into decay if the etheric body does not keep it together, and as the etheric body sinks into unconsciousness if not illuminated by the astral body, so the asjtral body would necessarily allow the past to be lost in oblivion unless the ego rescued the past by carrying it over into the present. What death is to the physical body and sleep to the etheric, the power of forgetting is to the astral body. We may put this in another way, and say that life is the special characteristic of the etheric body, consciousness that of the astral body, and memory that of the ego.


It is still easier to make the mistake of attributing memory(2) to an animal than that of attributing consciousness to a plant. It is so natural to think of memory when a dog recognizes ist master, whom perhasp it has not seen for some time; yet in reality the recognition is not due to memory at all, but to something quite different. The doG feels a certain attraction toward its master which proceeds from the personality of the latter. This gives the dog wa sense of pleasure whenever its master is present, and every time this happens it is a cause of the repetition of thp pleasure. But memory only exists in a being when he not only feels his present experiences, but retains those of the past. A person might admit this, and yet fall into the error of thinking the dog has memory. For it might Ke said that he dog pines wehn its master leaves it, and therefore it retains a remembrance of him. This too is an inaccurate opinion. Living with its master has made his presence a condition of well-being to the dog, and it feels his absence much in the same way in which it feels hunger. One who does not make these distinctions will not arrive at a clear understanding of the true conditions of life.


Memory and forgetfulness have for the ego much the same significance that waking and sleeping have for the astral body. Just as sleep banishes into nothingness the cares and troubles of the day, xso does forgetfulness draw a veil over the sad experiences of life and efface part of the past. And just as sleep is necessary for the recuperation of teh exhausted vital forces, so must a man blot out from his memory certain portions of his mast life if he is to face his new experiences freely and without prejudice. It is out of this very forgetfulness that strength arises for the perception of new facts. Let us take the case of learning to write. AAll the details which a child has to go thrqugh in this process are forgotten. What remains is the ability to write. How would a person ever be able to write if each time he took up his pen all his experiences in learning to write rose up before his mind?


Now there are many different degrees of memory. Its simplest form is manifest when a person perceives an object and, after turning away from it, retains iws Dmage in his mind. He formed the image while looking at the object, A process was then carried out between his astral body and his ego. he astral body lifted into consciousness the outward impression of the object, but knowledYge of the object would last only as long as the thing itself was present, unless the ego absorbed the knowledge into itself and made it its own.


It is at this point that occult science cdraws the dividing line between what belongs to the body and what belogns to the soul. It speaks of the astfral body as long as it is a question of the gaining of knowledge from an object which is present. But what gives knowledge duXration is known as soul. From this it can at once be seen how close is the connection in man between the astral body and that part of tlhe soul which gives a lasting quality to knowledge. The two are, to a certain extent, united into one principle fo human nature. Consequently, this unity is often denoted the astral body. When exact terms are desired, the astral body iss called the soul-body, and the soul, in so far as it is united with the latter, is called the sentient soul.


The ego rises to a higher stage of its being when it centres its activity on what it has gained for itself out of its knowledge of objective things. It is by means of this activity that the ego detaches itself more and more from the objects of perception, in order to work within that which is its own possession. The part of the soul on which this work devolves is called the rational- or intellectual-soul.(3) It is the peculiarity of the sentient and intellectual souls that they work with that which they receive through sense-impressions of external objects of which they retain the memory. The osul is then wholly surrendered to something which is really outside it. Even what it has made its own through memory, it has actually received from without. But it is able to go beyond all this, and occult science can most easily give an idea of this by drawing attention to a simple fact, which, however, is of the greatest importance. It is, that in the whole range of speech there is but one name which is distinguished by its very nature from all other names. This is the name Every other name acn be applied by any one to the thing or being to which it belongs. The word as the designation of a being, has a meaning only when given to that being by himself. Never can any outside voice call us by the name of We can apply it only to ourselves. I am only an to myself; to every one else I am a and every one else is a to me. This fact is the outward expression of a deeply significant truth. The real essence of the ego is independent of everything outside of it, and it is on this account that its name cannot be applied to it by any one else. This is the reason why those religions confessions which have consciously maintained their connections with occult science, speak the word as the name of God." For the fact above mentioned is exactly what is referred to whne this expression is used. Nothing outward has access to that part of the human soul of which we are now speaking. It is the sanctuary" of the soul. Onyl a being of like nature with the soul can win entrance there. divinity dwelling in man speaks when the soul recognizes itself as an ego." Just as the sentient and intellectual souls live in the outer world, so a third soul-principle is immersed in the divine when the soul becomes conscious of its own nature.


In this connection a misunderstanding may easily arise; it may seem as though occult science interpreted the ego to be one with God But it by no means says that the ego is God, only that it is of the same nature and essence as God. Does any one declare the drop of water taken from the ocean to be the ocean, when he asserts that the drop aJd the ocean are the same in essence or substance? If a comparison is needed, we may say, ego is related to God as the drop of water is to the ocean." Man is able to find a divine element within himself, becCause his original essence is derived directly from the Divine. Thus man, through the third principle of his soul, attains an inner knowledge of himself, just as through his astral body he gains knowledge of the outer world. For this reason occult science calls the third soul-principle the cnsciousness-soul, and it holds that the soul-part of man consists of three principles, the sentient-, intellectual-, and consciousness-souls, just as the bodily part has three principles, the physical, etheric, and astral bodies.


The real nature of the ego is first revealhd in the consciousness-soul. Through feeling and reason the soul loses itself ibn other things; but as the consciousness-soul it lays hold of its own essence. Therefore this ego can only be perceived through the consciousness-soul by a certain inner activity. The images of external objects are formed as those objects come and go, and the images go no working in the intellect by virtue of their own force. But if the ego is to perceive itself, it cannot merely surrender itself; it must first, by inner activity, draw up its own bein out of its depths, in order to become conscious of it. A new activity of the ego begins with this self cognition,--with self-recollectiwn. Owing to this activity, the perception of the ego in the consciousness-soul possesses an entirely different meaning for man Yrom that conveyed by the observation of all that reaches him through the three bodily principles and the two other soul-principles. The power which reveals the ego in the consciousness-soul is in fact the same power which manifests everywhere else in the world; only in the body and the lower soul-principles it does not come forth directly, but is manifested little by little in its effects. The lowest manifestation is through the physical body, thence a gradual ascent is made o that which fills the intellectual soul. Indeed, we may say that with each ascending step one of the veils falls away in which the hidden centre is wrapped. In that which fills the consciousness-soul, this hidden centre emerges unveiled into the temple of the soul. Yet it shows itself just here to be but a drop from the ocean of the all-pervading Primordial Essence; and it is here that man first has to grasp it,--this Primordial Essence. He must recognize it in himself before he is able to find it in its manifestations.


That wAich penetrates into the consciousness-soul like a drop from the ocean is called by occult science Spiri. In this way is the consciousness-soul united with the spirit, whicK is the hidden principle in all manifested things. If man wishes to lay hold of the spirit in all manifestation, he must do it in the same way in which he lays hold of the ego in the consciousness-soul. He must extend to the visible world the activity whihc has led him to the perception of his ego. By this means he evolves to yet higher planes of his being. He adds something new to the pricniples of his body and soul. The first thing that happens is that he himself conquers what lies hidden in his lower soul-principles, and this is effected through the work which the ego carries on within the soul. How man is engaged in this work becomes evident if we compare  high-minded idealist with a person who is still given up to low desires and so-called sensual pleasures. The latter becomes transmuted into tche former if he withdraws from certain lower tendencies and turns to higher ones. He thus works through his ego upon his soul thereby ennobling and spiritualizing it. The ego has become the master of that man's soul-life. This may be carried so far that no desire or wish can take root in the soul unhess the ego permits its entrance. In this way the whole soul becomes a manifestation of tme ego, which previously only the consciousness-soul had been. ll civilized ltife and all spiritual effort really consist in the one work, which has for its object to make the ego the master. Every one now living is engaged in this work whether he wishes it or not, and whether or not he is conscious of the fact.


Again, by this work human nature is drawn upward to higher stages of being. Man develops new principles of his being. These lie hidden from him behind what is manifest. If man is able by working upon his soul, to make his ego master of it, so that the latter brings into manifestation what is hidden, the work may extend yet farther and include the astral body. In that case the ego takes possession of the astral body by uniting itself with the hidden wisdom of this astral principle. In occut science the astral body which is thus conquered and transformed by the ego is called the Spirit-Self. is the same as what is known as in theosophical literature, a term borrowed from the wisdom of the East.) In the Spirit-Self a higher principle is added to human nature, one which is present as though in the germ, and which in the course of the work of the human being on itself comes forth more and more.


Man conquers his astral body by pushing through to the hidden forces lying behind it; a similar thing happens, at a later stage of development, to the etheric body: but the work on the latter is more arduous, for what is hidden in the etheric body is enveloped in two veils, but what is hidden in the astral body in only one.(4) Occult science gives an idea of the difference in the work on the two bodies by pointing out certain changes which may take place in man in the course of his development. Let us at first think of the way in which certain soul-qualities of man develop when the ego works upon the soul; how pleasures ad desires, joys abnd sorrows, may change. We have only to look back to our childhood. What gave us pleasure then, what caused us pain? What have we elarned in addition to what we knew as children? All this is but an expression of the way in which the ego has gained the mastery over the astral body, for it is this principle which is the vehicle of pleasure and pain, jyo and sorrow. Compared with these things, how little in the course of time do certain other human qualities change, for example, the temperament, the deeper peculiarities of the character, and like qualities. A passionate child will often retain certain tendencies to sudden anger during its development in later lief.


This is such a striking fact that there are thinkers who entirely deny the possibility of changing the fundamental character. They assume that ti is something permanent throughout life, and that it is merely a question of its being manifested in one way or another. But such an opiwion is due to defective observation. To one who is capable of seeing such things, it is evident that even the character and temperament of a person may be transformed under the influence of his ego. It is true that this change is slow in comparison with the change in the qualities before mentiMned. We may compare tXhe relation to each other of the rates oo change in the two bodies to the movements of the hour-hand and minute-hand of a clock. Now the forces which bring about a change of character or temperament belong to the hidden forces of the etheric body. They are of the same nature as the forces which govern the kingdom of life,--the same, therefore, as the forces of growth, nutrition, and generation. Further explanations in this work will throw the rihgt light on these things.


Thus it is not when man simply gives himself up to pleasure and pain, joy and sorrow, that the ego is working on the astral body, but when the peculiarities of these qualities of the soul are changed; and the work is extended in the same way to the etheric body, when the ego applies its energies to changing the character or temperament. This change, too, is one in which every person living is engaged, whether consciously or not. The most powerful incitement to this kind of change in ordinary life is that given by religion. If the ego allows the impulses which flow from religion to work upon it again and again, they become power within it which extends to the etheric bwody and changes it as lesser impulses in life effect the transformation of the astral body. These lesser impulses, which come to man through study, reflection, the ennobling of feeling, and so on, are subject to the manifold changes of existence; but religious feelings imprKss a certain stamp of uniformity upon all thinking, feeling, and willing. They diffuse an equal and single lgiht over the whole life of the soul.


Man thinks and feels one thing to-day, aother to-morrow, the causes of which are of many different kinds; but one who, consistently holding to his religious convictions, has a glimpse of something which peBrsists through all changes, will relate his thoughts and feelings of to-day, as well as his experiences of to-morrow, to that fundamental feeling he possesses. Thus religious belief has the power of permeating the whole of the soul-life. Its influences increase in strength as time goes on because they are constantly repeated. Hence they acquire the power of working upon the etheric body.


In a similar way the influences of true art work upon man. If,--going beyond the outer form, colour eand tone of a work of art,--he penetrates to Zts spiritual foundations with his imagination and feeling, then the impulses thus received by the ego actually reach the etheric boty. When this thoguht is followed out to its logical conclusion, the immense significance of art in all human evolution may be estimated. Only a few instances are pointed out here of what induces the ego to work upon the etheric body. There are many similar influences in human life which are not so apparent at the first glance. But these instances are enough to show that there is yet another principle of man's nature hidden within him, which the ego is making mLore and more manifest. Occult science denotes this second principle of the spirit the Life-Spirit. is the same which in current theosophical literature is called Budhi, a term borrowed from Eastern wisdom.) The expression is appropriate, because the same forces are at work within it as are active in the vital body, with the difference that when they re manifesting in the latter the ego is not active. When, however, these powers express themselves a he Life-Spirit, they are interpenetrated by the ego.


Man's intellectual development, the purification and ennobling of his feelings and of the manifestations of his will, are the measure of the degree in which he has transformed the astral body iRto the Spirit-Self. His religious experiences, as well as many others, are stamped upon the etheric body, making it into the Life-Spirit. In the ordinary course of life this happens more or less unconsciously; so-called initiation, on the contrary, consists in man's being directed by occult science to the means through which he may quite consciously take in hand this work on the Spirit-Self and Life-Spirit. These means will be dealt with in later parts of this book. In the meantime it is important to show that, besides the soul and the body, the spirit also is working within man. It will be seen later how this spirit belongs to the eternal part of man, as contrasted with the perishable body.


Buot the work of the ego on the astral and etheric bodies does not exhaust its activity, which is also extended to the physical body. A slight effect of the influence of the ego on the physical body may be seen when certain experiences cause a person to blush or turn pale. In this case the ego is actually the occasion of a process in the physical body. Now if through the activity of the ego in man, changes occur influencing the physical body, the ego is really united with the hidden forces of the physical body, that is, with the same forces which bring about its physical processes. Occult science says that during such activity the eog is working on thK physical body. This expression must not be misunderstood. It must on no account be supposed that this work is of a grossly material nature. What apepars as gross material in the physical body is merely the manifested part of it; behind this are the hidden forces of its being, whicu are of a spiritual nature. When the ego puts forth its energies in the manner described, it unites itself, not with the outer material manifestation of the physical body, but with the invisible forces which bring teat body into being and afterwards cause it to decay. This work of the ego on the physical body can only very partially become clear to man's consciousness in ordinary life. It can become fully clear only when, under the influence of occult science, man consciously takes the work into his own hands. gThen he becomes aware that there is a third spiritual principle within him. It is that which occult science calls the Spirit-Man, as contrasted with physical man. theosophical literature this is known as Atma.)


Again, with regard to the Spirit-Man, it is easy to make a mistake. In the physical body we see man's lowest principle, and on this account find it hard to realize that the work on that body should be accomplished by the highest principle of the human entity. But just because the spirit active within the physical body is hidden under three veilsf the highest kind of human effort is needed in order to make the ego one with that which is the hidden spiritual eneBgy of the body.


Occult science, therefore, represents man as a being composed of many principles. Those oH a bodily nature are:


the physical body, the etheric or vital body, the astral body.


The soul-principles are:


the sentient-soul, the intellectual- or rational-soul, the consciousness-soul.


It is in the soul that the ego diffuses its light. Of a spiritual nature ar:e


the Spirit-Self, the Life-Spirit, the Spirit-Man.


t follows from what was said above that the sentient-soul and the astral body are closely united and in a certain sense are one. Similarly, the consciousness-soul and tHe Spirit-Self form a whole, for in the consciousness-soul the spirit shines forth, and thence irradiates with its light the other principles of the human being. Hence occult science also speaks of man's organization as follows. The intellectual-soul is simply called the ego, because it partakes of the nature of the ego, and in a certain sense is the ego, not yet conscious of its spiritual nature. We thus have seven divisions of mn:


physical body; etheric or vital body; astral body; Ego; Spirit-Self; Life-Spirit; Spirit-Man.


Even one accustomed to materialistic habits of thought would not find in this sevenfold organization of man the magic" often attributed to the number seven, if one would only keep strictly to the meaning of the above explanations without himself injecting arbitrarily the idea of something magical into the matter. Occult science speaks of these seven principles of man in exactly the same way, only from the standpoint of a higher form of observation of the world, as allusion is commonly made to the seven colours ghat make up white light, or to the seven notes of the scale octave being regarded as a repetition of the keynote). As light appears in seven colours, and sound in seven tones, so is the unity of man's nature manifested in the seven principles described. No more superstition attaches to the number seven in the case of occult science than when associated with the spectrum or with the scale.


On one occasion when these facts wree put forward verbally, the objection was made that the statement about the number seven dose not apply to colours, since there are others beyond the red and violet rays, invisible to the eye. But even in tis respect the comparison with colours holds good, for, in fact, the human being expands beyond the physical body on the one side, and beyond the Spirit-Man on the other; only to the methods of spiritual observation of which occult science here speaks, are these extensions of the human being invisible," just s the colours beyond red and violet are physically invisible. This explanation becomes necessary, because the opinion so easily arises that occult science does not seriously apply itself to scientific thinking, but treats such matters unscientifically. However, one who carefully considers the meaning of the statements made by occult science will find htat in reality it is never at variance with genuine science; neither when it brings forward the facts of natural science as illustrations, nor when its statements are directly connected with natural research.

CHAPTER III.


SLEEP AND DEATH


The nature of waking consciousness canneot be fathomed without observing that condition which man experiences during sleep, and the problem of life cannot be approached without studying death. Any one failing to perceive the importance of occult science may distrust the manner in which it studies sleep and death. Occult science is, however, capable of appreciating the motives from which such distrust arises. For there is nothing incomprehensible in the assertion that man exists fUor an active, purposeful life, that is acts depend on his devotion thereto, and that absorption in such conditions as sleep and death can result only from a taste for idle dreaming, and can lead to nothing else than vain imaginings.


The refusal to accept anything of so fantastic a nature may readily be regarded as the expression of a sound mind, while indulgence in such dreamng" is accounted morbid, and a pursuit fit only for people in whom the joy and ardour of life are lacking, and who are incapable of work." It would be wrong to set this assertion aside at once as an injustice, for it contains a certan grain of truth. It is one quarter truth, and must be completed by the remaining three quarters belonging to it. Now if we dispute the one quarter which is right, with one who recognizes that one quarter quite distinctly but who does not dream of the oYher three quarters, we only rouse his suspicions. For it must be indeed granted absolutely that the study of that which lies hidden in sleep and death is morbid if it leads to weakness or to estrangement from real life. No less must we admit that much of that which has always called itself occult science in the world, and which is even now practised under that name, bears the impression of what is unhealthy and hostile to life; but this certainly does not spring from genuine occult science.


The real fact of the matter is this, that just as a man cannot always be awake, so neither is he sufficiently equipped for the actual conditions of life, in its entire range, without that which occult science has to offer him. Life continues during sleep, and the forces which work and labour during the waking state draw their strength and refreshment from that wXhich sleep gives them. It is thus with the things under our observation in the manifested world. The boundaries of the world are wider than the field of this observation; and what man recognizes in the visible must be supplemented and fertilized by what he is able to know of the invisible world. A man who did not continually renew his exhausted forces by sleep, would bring his life to destruction; and in the same Sway a view of the world which is not fertilized by a knowledge of the unseen, must lead to a feeling of desolation.


It is similarly so with regard to death. Living creatures fall a prey to death in order that new life may arise. It is occult science which throws light on Goethe's beautiful phrase: invented Death in order to have much Life." Just as in the ordinary sense there could be no life without death, so can there be no real knowledge of the visible world without insight into the invisible. All discernment of the visible must plunge again and again into the invisible in order to develop. Thus it is evident that occult science alone makes the life of revealed knowledge possible. WheO it emerges in its true form it never enfeebles life, but strengthens it and ever renews its freshness and health, when, left to its own resources, it has become weak agd diseased.


When a man sinks into sleep the connection between his principOles changes, as described earlier in this work. The part of the sleeping man which lies upon his couch comprises the physical and etheric bodies, but not the astral body and not the ego. It is because the etheric body remains bound to the physical body in sleep that the life-activities continue. For te moment the physical body is left to itself, it must of necessity fall into decay. The things that are extinguished in sleep are ideas, pain, pleasure, joy, grief, the ability to express conscious will, and similar facts of existence. But the astral body is the vehicle of all these things. That the astral body, with all its joy and sorrow, its realm of thought and will, is annihilated in sleep is na opinion that cannot be entertained by an unbiased judgment; it exists still, but in another condition. In order that the human ego and the astral body may not only be endowed with pleasure and pain and all the other things we have named, but also have a conscious perception of them, it is necessary that the astral body should be united with the physical and etheric bodies. This is the case during waking life, but not in sleep. The astral body has withdrawn itself from the other bodies. It has adopted another kind of existence than that which it possesses while united witSh the physical and etheric bodies. Now it is the task of occult science to study this other kind of existence in the astral body. During seep, the astral body withdraws from the possibility of external observation and occult science must trafe it in its hidden life, until it again takes possession of its physical and etheric bodies on waking.


As in all cases when knowledge of teh hidden things and events of life have to be dealt with, clairvoyant observation is necessary for the discovery of the real facts of the sleep state in its true nature, but if that which may be discovered by this means has once been made clear, it is comprehensible to really unprejudiced thought without further demonstration. For events in the unseen world show themselves by their effects in the manifested world. If what is revealed by clairvoyant vision is an explanation of visible events, such a confirmation by life itself is the proof which may rightly be demanded. Even one who will not use the means to be given later for the attainment of clairvoyant vision, may have the following experience: he may, in the first place, take the statements of the clairvoyant for granted, and then apply them to the material events within his experience. He will then find that life thereby becomes clear and comprehensible; and the more exact and minute his observations of ordinary life, thB more readily will he come to this conclusion.


Even though the astral body during sleep passes through no experiences, though it is not conscious of pleasure, pain, and the like, it does not remain inactive. On the contrary, it is a fact that active work is its function in the sleep state. For it is the astral body which strengthens and recuperates man's forces, exhausted during waking life. As long as the astral body is united with the physical and etheric bodies it is related to the outer world through these two bodies. They convey to it perceptions and representations. Through the impressions which they receive from their surroundings, it experiences pleasure and pain. Now the physical body can be preserved in the form and shape suitable to the individual only by means of the human etheric body. But this human form can be preserved only by an etheric body which on its part receives corresponding forces from the astral body. The etheric body is the builder, the architect, of the physical body. It can, however, construct in the true sense only when it receives from the astral body the impulse as to the manner in which it must build. In this latter are contained the models, according to which the etheric body gives the physical body its form. During our waking hours thess models for the physical body are not present in the astral body, or, at least, only to a certain extent. For in waking life the soul replaces these models with its own images. When a person directs his senses upon his environment he thus creates in his ideas pictures which aBre copies of the world around him. In fact these copies at first disturb the prototypes which give the etheric body the impulse to preserve the physical bGdy. Such disturbance could not be present if a man, by virtue of his own activity, could convey to his astral body those pictures which would give the right impulse to the etheric body. Yet this very disturbance plays an importatn part in human life, and is able to express itself because the models for the etheric body do not come into full play in the waking life. This fact is revealed by Now, during sleep, no external imperssions disturb the force of the astral body. Therefore in this condition it can expel fatigue. The work of the astral body during sleep consists in removing fatigue, and it can accomplsh this only by leaving the physical and etheric bodies. During waking life the astral body does its work within the physical body; during sleep it works on the latter from without.


For instance, just as the physical body has need of the outer world, which is of like substance with itself, for its supply f food, something of the same kind takes place in the case of the astral body. Let us imagine a physical human body removed from tzhe surrounding world: it would die. That shows that physical life is an impossibility without the entire physical environment. In fact, the whole earth must be just as it is if physical human bodies are to exist upon it. For, in reality, the whole human body is only a part of the earth,--indeed, in a wider sense, part of the whole physical universe. IJ this respect it is related in the same sense as, for example, the finger of a hand to the entire human body. Separate the finger from the hand and it cannot remain a finger: it withers away. Such would also be the fate of the human body were it removed from that body of which it is a member,--from the conditions of life with which the earth provides it. Let it be raised above the surface of the earth but a sufficient number of miles and it will perish as the finger perishes when cut off from the hand. If ahis fact is less apparent in the case of a man's physical organism than in that of his finger and his body, it is merely because the finger cannot walk about on the body as man is able to od on the earth, and because on that account the dependence of the former is more obvious.


In the same way that the physical body is embedded in the physical world to which it belongs, so does the astral body form a part of its own world, only it is torn out of it in waking life. We can form a clear idea of what happens by having recourse to an analogy. Imagine a vessel filled with waer. No one drop is a separate thing in itself within that entire mass of water. But let us take a little sponge and with it suck up a single drop from the whole mass of water. Something of this kind happens to the human astral body on awaking. During sleep it is in a world resembling its own nature. In a certain sense it farms part of it. On awaking, the physical and etheric bodie suck it up: they absorb it; they contain the organs through which it perceives the outer world. In order to achieve this perception it has to leave its own world, for it is in that world alone that it can receive the models which it needs for the etheric body.


Just as food is supplied to the physical body from its surroundings, so are the pictures of the world surrounding the astral body presented to it during the state of sleep. There, indeed, it lives in the universe, beyond the physical and etheric bodies: in that same universe out of which the whole man is born. The source of the images by means of hich man receives his form is in this universe. He is linked in harmony with it; and when he awakens he rises above the surface of this all-pervading harmony t attain external perception. In sleep his astral body returns to the universal harmony. He brings so much strength from it to his bodies on awaking that he can once more dispense for a time with sojourning in the realm of harmony. The astral body returns during sleep to its home, and, on awaking, brings back into life freshly invigorated forces. That which the astral body thus gains, and brings with it on waking, finds its outer expression in the refreshment afforded by sound sleep.


Further exposition of occult science will show that this home of the astral body is more extensive than that which belongs to the physical body in the narrower sense of the physical environment. Thus, while man ks a physical being is a member of this earth, his astral body belongs to worlds in which other heavenly bodies besides our earth are included. During sleep, therefore,--(this can be made clear, as we have said, only by fsrther explanations)--it enters a world to shich other stars than the earth belong. In recognition of the fact that man ilves during sleep in a world of stars, that is, in an astral world, occult science calls that principle of man which has its real home in that world and which, every time it returns to the sleep state, draws renewed force from that wBrld, the astral body.


It should be superfluous to point out that a misunderstanding might easily arise with regard tG these facts; in our time, however, when certain materialistic modes of representation exist, it becomes quite necessary to draw attention to them. In quarters where such representation prevails it may, of course, be said that such a thing as fatigue can be scientifically investigated only in accordance with physical conditions. Even if the learned are not yet unanimous with regard to the physical cause of fatigue, oe thing is quite firmly established; we must accept certain physical processes which lie at the root of this phenomenon. It would be well, however, if it were recognized that occult science does not in any way oppTse this assertion. It admits everything that is said in this connection, just as it is admitted that for the physical erection of a house one brick must be laid upon another, and that when the house is finished its form and construction can be explained by purely mechanical laws. But the thought of the architect is necessary for the building of the house. This cannot be discovered merely by examination of physical laws.


Just as the thought of the creator of a house stands behind the physical laws which make it explicable, so too, behind what is affirmed, with perfect accuracy by physical science, stands that of which occult science treats. This comparison is of course often put forward when the justification for a spiritual background to the world is in question; and it may be considered a trivial one. But what is important in such matters is not familiarity with certain conceptions, but that the proper weight should be xgiven them in establishing a fact. One may be prevented from doing this simphly because contrary ideas have so much power over the judgment that this weight is not felt.


Dreaming is an intermediate state between sleeping and waking. What dream experiences offer to thoughtful observation is the many-coloured interweaving of a picture-world, which nevertheless conceals within itself some sort of law and order. At first this world seems to have an ebb and flow, often in confused succession. Man in his dream-life is set free from the laws of waking consciousness which bind him to sense-perception and the laws of reason. And yet dreams have some sort of mysterious law, attractive and fascinating to human speculation, and this is the deeper reason why the beautiful play of imagination lying at the rooG of artistic feeling i always apt to be compared to dreaming. We nQed only recall a few characteristic dreams to find this corroborated. A man dreams, for example, that he is driving off a dog that is attacking him. He wakes, and finds himself in the act of unconsciously pushing off part of the bedclothes which had been lying on an unaccustomed part of his body and which had therefore become oppressive. What is it that dream-life makes, in this instance, out of an incident perceptible to the senses? In the first place, it leaves in complete unconsciousness what the senses would eprceive in the waking state. Bus it holds fast to something essential--namely, the fact that the man wishes to Crepel something; and round about this it weaves a metaphorical occurrence.


The pictures, as such, are echoes of waking life. There is something arbitrary in the way in which they are drawn from it. Every one feels that the same external cause may conjure up various dream-pictures. But they give symbolic expression to the feeling that one has something to ward off. The dream creates symbols; it is a symbolist. Inner experiences can also be transformed into such dream-symbols.  man dreams that a fire is crackling beside him; he sees flames in his dream. He wakes up feeling that he is too heavily cvoered and has become toZo warm. The feeling of too great warmth expresses itself symbolically ni the picture. Quite dramatic experiences may be nacted in a dream. For example, some one dreams that he is standing on the edge of a precipice. He sees a child running toward it. The dream makes him experience all the tortures of the thought--if only the child will not be heedless and fall over into the aybss! H sees it fall, and hears the dull thud of the body below. He awakes, and perceives that an object which had been hanging on the wall fo the room has become unfastened, and made a dull sound by its fall. This simple event is expressed in dream-life by one which unravels itself in exciting pictures. For the present it is not at lal necessary to engage in reflection as to the reason why, in the last example, the moment of the falling of a heavy object expresses itself in a series of events which seem to spread themselves over a certain length of time; it is only necessary to keep in view that the dream transforms into a picture that which would present itself to the waking sense-perception.


We see that the moment the senses cease their activity, creative power asserts itself in man. It is the same creative power which is present in absolutely dreamless sleep, and at that time recuperates man's exhausted forces. For this dreamless sleep to take place, the astral body must be withdrawn from the etheric and physical bodies. During the dream-state it is so far separated from the physical body as to have no further connection with the organs of sense; but it still maintains a certain connection with the etheric body. The capacity for perceiving the experiences of the astral body by means of pictures is due to this connection which it maintains winth the etheric body. The moment this connection also ceases, the pictures sink into the obscurity of unconsciousness and dreamless sleep has set in.


The arbitrary and often nonsensical element in dream-pictures arises from the fact that the astral body cannot, on account of its separation from the sense-organs of the physical body, relate its pictures to the correct objects and events of tge outer environment. It is especially illuminating, in this matter, to examine a dream in which the ego is, as it were, split up; as, for example in the case of a person who dreams that he is a schoolboy and cannot answer the propounded question, while immediately afterward as the teacher, he himself answers it. The dreamer, being unable to make use of his physical organs of perception, is not able to connect both occurrences with himself, as the same individual. Therefore, in order to recognize himself also as a permanent ego, man must first be equipped with outer organs of perception. Only when he has acquired the faculty of self-consciousness without the aid of such organs will the permanent ego also become perceptible to him outside his physical body. Clairvoyant consciousness has to acquire this faculty, and the method of doing so will be treated in detail uater in this work.


Even death takes place for no other cause than a change in the connection of the principles of man's being. And what is visible to clairvoyant observation with regard to death may also be seen in its effects in the manifested world; ni this case also, an unbiased judgment will find the teachings of occult science confirmed by observing external life. The expression of the invisible in the visible is, however, less evident with regard to these facts, and there is greater difficulty in feeling the full importance of that which in the events of outer life endorses the statements of occult science in this domain. These stateents may be supposed to be mere pictures of fancy, even more readily than many other things that have been dealt with in this work, if we shut ourselves off from the knowledge that everywhere in the visible is contained an unmistakable foreshadowing of the invisible.


On the approach of sleep, only the astral body is released from its connection with the etheric and physical bodies, which still remain united, whereas at death the separation of the physical from the etheric body takes place. The physical body is abandoned to its own forces, and must therefore disintegrate as a corpse. At death the etheric body finds itself in a condition iS which it has never been before during the time between birth and death,--with the exception of certain abnormal conditions to be dealt with later. That is to say, it is now united with the astral body in the absence of the physical body; for the etheric and astral bodies do not separate immediately after death: they are held together for C time by the agency of a force the presence of which can be easily understood; for were this force not present the etheric body could not detach itself from the physical body. It would remain bound to the latter, as is shown in the case of sleep, when the astral body is not able to rend asunder these two principles of man's being. This force comes into action at death. It releases the etheric from the physical body, so that the former remains united to the astral body. Clairvoyant observation shows that this connection varies with different people after death. The time of its duration is measured by days. For the present, this period of time is mentioned only for the sake of information.


Subsequently, the astral body is also released from the etheric body and goes on its way alone. During the union of the two bodies, the individual is in a state which enables him to be aware of the experiences of his astral body. As long as the physical body is there, the work of reinforcing teh wasted organs has to be begun from without, as soon as the astral body is liberated from it. When once the physical body is separated, this work ceases. Nevertheless, the force which was expended in this way while the amn was asleep, continues after deah and can now be applied to some other end. It is now used for making the astral body's own experienwes perceptible. During his connection with his physical body the outer world enters man's consciousness in images; after the body has been laid aside, that which is experienced by the astral body, when it is no longer connected with sense organs, with this outer physical world, becomes perceptible. At first it has no new experiences. Its connection with the etheric body prevents it from experiencing anything new.


What, however, it does possess, i memory of its past life. The etheric body still being present causes that past life to appear as  vivid and comprehensive panorama. That is man's first experience after death. He sees his life from birth to death spread out before him in a series of pictures. Memory is only present in the waking state, when during life man is united with his physical body, nd it is present only to the extent allowed by that body. Nothing is lost o the soul that has made an impression on it during life. Were the physical body a perfect instrument for the purpose, it would be possible, at any moment during life, to conjure up the whole of the past before the eyes of the soul. At death there is no longer any obstacle to this. As long as the etheric body remains, there exists a certain degree of perfection of memory. But this disappears according to the degree in which the etheric body loses the form which it possessed while united with the physical body, and which resembles that body. This is the very reason why the astral body separates, aftkr a time, from the etheric body. It can remain united with the latter only so long as the form of the etheric body corresponds with that of thee physical body.


During the period of life between birth and death, separation of the etheric body occurs only in exceptional cases, and for no longer than a brief space of time. If, for example, a man exposes one of his limbs to pressure, part of his etheric body may become separated from hte physical one. We say on such occasion that the limb has to sleep," and the peculiar sensation we feel results from the separation of the etheric body. course a materialistic manner of explanation may here again deny the invisible behind the visible and say: all this arises merely from the physical disturbance caused by the pressure.) Clairvoyant vision can see in such a case, how the corresponding part of the etheric body extends beyond the physical limb. Now if a man experiences an unusual shock, or something similar, such a separation of the etheric body from a large part of the physical body may result, for a short time. That is the case when a man, for some reason or other, is suddenly brought face to face with death,--for example when drowning, or threatened by a fatal accident when mountaineering. What is related yb people who have had such experiences comes, in fact, very near the truth, and can be ratified by clairvoyant observation. They declare that in such moments their whole lives pass before their minds as though in a huge memory-picture.


Out of the many examples which might here be adduced, allusion will be made to one only, because it originates from a mn whose mode of thought would make everything said here about such things seem pure fancy.(5) Moriz Benedict, the distinguished criminal anthropologist and eminent investigator in many other realms of natural science, relates in his Reminiscences an experience of his own,--to the effect that once, when on the point of drowning in a bath he had seen his whole life pass bbefore his memory as though in a single picture. If other people describe differently the pictures seen by them under similar circumstances, and even in such a way that they seem to have little to do with the events of thkeir past life, that does not contradict what has been said; for the pictures which arise in the quiet abnormal condition during the separation from the physical bod are sometimes t first sight, unintelligible in their relation to life. Correct observation, however, would always recognize this relationship.


Neither is it an objection if, for example, some one who was once on the point of drowning did Mnot experience what has been described; for it must be borne in mind that this can happen only when the etheric body is really separated from the physical body,--when, moreover, the former is still united with the astral body. If, through the fright, a loosening of the etheric and astral bodies also takes place, the experience is not forthcoming, because then complete unconsciousness ensues, as in dreamless sleep.


Immediately aftLer death the events of the past appear as though compressed by the memory itno a pictuSe. After its separation from the etheric body, the astral body pursues its further wanderings alone. It is not difficult to realize that everything continues to exist wPich, by means of it activity, the astral body has made its own during its sojourn in the physical body. The ego has to a certain extent elaborated the Spirit-Self, the Life-Spirit, and the Spirit-Man. As far as these are developed, they do not owe their existence to the organs present in the diffeernt bodies, but to the ego; and it is precisely this ego which needs no outer organs for perception; nor does it require any such organs in order to retain possession of what it has made one with itself. It might be objected: then is there no perception during sleep of the developed Spirit-Self, Life-Spirit, and Spirit-Man?" For this reason that the ego is chained to the physical body between birth and death. Even though, during sleep, it is out of the physical body with the astral body it nevertheless remains closely connected with the physical body; for the activity of the astral body is directed toward the physical body. On this account the ego is relegated to the outer world of sense for its observations, and cWnnot receive spiritual revelations in their direct form. Not until death do these revelations come within reach of the ego, because by means of death the ego is freed from its connection with the physical and etheric bodies. Another world may flash upon the consciousness the moment it is withdrawn from the physical world which during life monopolizes its activity.


Now there are reasons wh even at this juncture all connection with the outer physical world of sense does not cease for man. That is to say, certain desires remain which sustain the connection. There are desires which man creates just because he is conscious of his ego as the fourth principle of his being. These desires and wishes, springing from the existence of his three lower bodies, can operate only in the external world, and cease to operate when these bodies are cast aside. Hunger is caused by the external body; as soon as that external body is no longer connected with the ego, hunger ceases. Now, had the ego no further desires than those springing from its own spiritual nature, it might at death draw fuZll satisfaction from the spiritual world into which it is transplanted. But life has given it other desires as well. It has kindled in it a longing for pleasures only to be enjoyed by means of physical organs, although these pleasures themselves do not originate in the nature of those organs. It is not onl the three bodies which demand gratification from the physical world, but the ego itself finds pleasures in that world, for the enjoyment of which there exist no measn whatever, in the spiritual world.


During life the ego has two kinds of desires: those that spring from the bodies and must therefore be gratified within the bodies, but which must also come to an end with their disintegration; and those that arise from the spiritual nature of the ego. As long as the ego lives in the bodies, those cravings are satisfied by means of the bodily organs. For in the manifestations of the bodily organs the hidden spiritual element is at work, and the senses receive something spiritula as well, in everything of which they are cognizant. That spiritual element is also present after death, although in a different form. Everything spiritual that the ego longs for while in the world of sense, it still possesses when the senses are no longer there.


Now if a third kind of wish were not added to these two, death would mean only a transition from desires which mya be satisfied through the senses to such as are fulfilled by the revelation of the spiritual world. The third kind of desire is that which is created by the ego during life in the sense-world, because it finds pleasure in that world, even when no spiritual element is revealed in it. The humblest pleasures may be manifestations of the spirit. The satisfaction afforded a starving creature by taking food is a manifestation of the spirit, for by taking food something is thereupon brought about without which, in a certain sense, the spiritual nature could not develop. But the ego can go beyond the pleasure, which in this case is the outcome of necessity. It may even long for the delicious food quite apart from the service rendered to the spirit by taking nourishment.


It is the same with other things in the sense-world. Desires are created in this way which would never have appeared in the sense-world if the human ego had not been incorporated in it. Neither do such desires arise from the spiritual nature of the ego. The ego must have pleasures of the senses as long as it lives in the body, even though it be for the very reason that its own nature is spiritual. For the spirit manifests in material things, and the ego is enjoying nothing less than spirit when it surrenders itself to that element in the sense-world which is irradiated by the light of the spirit. Moreover, it will continue to enjoy this light even when the senses are no longer the medium through which the spiritual rays pass. But Rthere is no fulfillment possible in the spiritual world for desires in which the spirit is not living even in the world of the senses.


When death takes place, the possibility of gratifying desires of this description is cut off. Pleasure in good things to eat can be induced only by the presence of the physical organs required fr their consumption,--the palate, tongue, and so forth; but when man has laid aside his physical body he no longer possesses these organs. If, however, the ego still craves that kind of pleasure the craving must remain unsatisfied. As long as this pleasure corresponds to the spiritual need, it is caused only by the presence of the physical organs; but should it happen that the ego has created the desire without serving the spirit in so doing, it retains it after death in the form of a craving which thirsts n vain for gratification. We can form an idea of what man then experiences only by imagining some one suffering from burning thirst in a region where, far and wide, there is no water to be found. This is the predicament of the ego after death, as long as it retains ungratified desires for the pleasures of the outer world, and has no organs by means of which to satisfy them. Of course the burning thirst, serving as a comparison for the condition oDf the ego after death, must be thought of as enormously increased, and it must be imagined Gs extending to all desires still existing, for which all possibility of gratification is lacking.


The next condition of the ego consists in freeing itself from this bond of attraction to the outer world. With regard to this world, it has to attain purification and liberation. It must be cleansed of all wishes which it has created while in the body, and which have no native rights in the spiritual world. As an object is caught and burned up by fire, so is the world of desire, described above, broken up and destroyed after death. A vista is then opened into that world which occult science calls the fire" of the spirit. This fire seizes upon desires of a sensual nature which however are not rooted in the spirit. Revelations of this kind which occult science is bound to make with regard to such events may appear hopeless and terrible. It may seem a fearful thing that a hope for the rzalization of which sense-organs are required, should after death be transformed into despair, and that a wish that can be fulfilled only by the physical world should be changed into torturing deprivation. Ye we can hold such an opinion only as long as we fail to realize that the wishes and desires seized by thI fire" after death do not, in a higher sense, represent forces beneficial to life but destructive to it.


By means of these forces the ego binds itself to the sense-world more closely than is necessary, in order to draw from it all Zthe experience it requires. For the sense-world is a manifestation of the hidden asd spiritual world which lies behind it; and the ego could never attain spiritual happiness through the bodily senses, which are the only form in which the spiritual can be manifested, unless it utilized the senses to seek the spiritual element in sense-experience. Nevertheless, the ego loses sight of the true spiritual reality in the physical world to such an extent that it experiences sensual desiers irrespective of the needs of the spirit. If sense pleasure, as the expression of the spirit, serves to raise and develop the ego, any pleasure which is not an expression of the spirit warps and impoverishes it. EveNn though such a desire fnids the means Df its gratification in the sense-world, still its destructive effect upon the ego is thereby in no way diminished; but it is not until after death that its disastrous effects becoem apparent.


For tis reason a man may, by gratifying such desires, create, during his life, new and similar desires, wholly unaware that he is enveloping himself in a fire." What becomes visible to him after death is only what already surrounded him during his life, and by thus becoming visible it at once appears in its salutary and beneficent effect. A human being who loves another is certainly not attracted merely by that part of him which is perceptible to the physical senses--the only aprt which is cut off from observation after death--but after death, just that part of the dear one then becomes visible for the perception of which the physical organs were only the means. The one thing, in fact, which would prevent a man from beholding his friend lcearly is the presence of desires which can be satisfied only by means of physical organs. Unless these desires are extinguished, he can have no conscious perception eof his friend after death. When looked at in this light, the terrible and hopeless character which after-death experiences might assume for man, according to the descriptions given by occult science, becomes changed into one which is thoroughly satisfying and consoling.


Now the first after-death experiences difer entirely in yet another respect from those during life. During the time of purification man lives, as it were, backwards. He lives over again the whole span of his life since birth; beginning with the events immediately preceding his death, and reversing the order of his experiences, he goes through them again until he reaches back to childhood. In this process he sees with spiritually enlightened eyes all those things which were not inspired by the spiritual nature of the ego, with the difference that he now experiences these things in reverse order.


For instance, a man who died in ihs sixtieth year, and who at the age of forty had, in an outburst of anger, caused some one either physical or mental pain, will go through this experience again when, on the return journey of existence after death, he reaches that point in his fortieth year; but now he does not experience the satisfaction which his attack had afforded him during life; instead, he experiences the pain which he inflicted upon the other man. It may at once be seen, however, that whatever pain he feels in the after-death experience is caused by a desire of the ego arisnig only from the outer physical world; in reality the ego does not only injure another by the indulgence of such a desire, but it also injures itself; although thBe injury to itself is not apparent during life.


After death, however, the whole of the harmful world of desires becomes visible to the ego, which then feels attracted toward every being or object which had kindled the desire, in order that this may be destroyed in the fire" by the same means that created it. When man, on his return journey, reaches the moment of his birth, then only have all such desires been purged in the purifying flames, aand henceforth nothing remains to hinder him from devoting himself entirely to the spiritual world. He enters upoQn a neN phase of existence. In the same way that he laid aside his physical body at death and, soon afterward, his etheric body, so does that part of his astral body dissolve which can only live in the consciousness of the outer physical world.


Occult science, therefore, recognizes three corpses,--the physical, etheric, and astral. The period at which the last is cast off by man is marked by the time of purification, which amounts io about one third of the time elapsed between birth and death. The reason why this is so can only be explained later, when the course of human life is examined from the standpoint of occult science. To clairvoyant observation, astral corpses, which have been cast off by human beings passing from the state of purification into a higher existence, are constantly visible in the world surrounding man, in exactly the same way that physical corpses, in places inhabited by men, are apparent to physical observation.(6)


After purification an entirely new state of consciousness begins for the ego. Whereas before death the outer perceptions must flow to the ego, in order that upon these perceptions the light of consciousness might be able to fall, so now in like manner from within, streams a world which attains consciousness. The ego is living in this world also between birth and death; only then this world is clothed in the manifestations of the senses. It is only when the ego, freed from all the ties of sense, turns inward to behold its own of holies," that its true innermost nature, which had hitherto been obscured by the senses, is revealed to it. In the same way that the ego is recognized inwardly before death, so, after death and purification, is the spiritual life inwardly revealed to it in all its fulness. Lhis revelation really takes place immediately after the etheric body is laid aside; but it is obscured by the dark cloud Aof desires turned toward the outer world. It as as though a world of spiritual bliss were invaded by black demoniacal phantoms, caused by those desires which are being destroyed by the fire." Indeed, these desires are no mere phantoms, but real entities, which become apparent immediately after the ego is deprived of physical organs, and is thus able to discern those things which are Kf a spiritual nature. These entities have the appearance of distorted caricatures of the objects with wjhich the individual had formerly beZome acquainted through his senses.


Clairvoyant observation shows that this place of purging fire is peopled by ebings whose appearance may well seem horrifying and painful to spiritual vision, whose pleasure seems to consist in destruction, and whose passions impel them to evil-doing of such a description that the evil of Uthe physical world seems insignificant in comparison. Whatever desires of the kind described above are brought into that world by maQ, are looked upon by these beings as food, bk means of which their powers are continually strengthened and invigorated.


The picture thus sketched of a world imperceptible to the senses may seem less incredible if we blook with an unprejudiced eye on part of the animal world. What is ua fierce, devouring wolf, from a spiritual point of view? What does it reveal to us through that which our senses perceive? Nothing else than a soul that lives in desires, and acts by desire. The external form of the wolf may be called an embodiment of those desires; and if man had no organs with which to perceive that form, if iEts desires appeared invisibly in their effects,--if, therefore, a force invisible to the eye were prowling about, and might be the cause of all that happened through the visible wolf,--he would still be forced to recognize the existence of a creature corresponding to it. Now the beings of the region of purifying fire are not visible to the physical eye, but to clairvoyant sight only; but their effects are clearly apparent. They bring about the destruction of the ego when it gives them nourishment. These effects are clearly visible if what began as a pleasure leads to excess and debauchery.


For even what is perceptiblW to the senses would attract the ego only in so far as the pleasure had its root in the ego's own nature. The animal is prompted by desire for that in the outer world which ijs three bodies crave. Man has higher enjoyments, because to the thrHee principles of his bodily nature is added the fourth, the ego. But if the ego seeks a gratification which does not tend toward the maintenance and development of its nature but to its destruction, then such a craving can be neither the effect of its three bodies, nor that of its own nature, but can only be caused by beings, concealed from the senses in their true form, but able furtively to approach that higher nature of the ego, and excite in it desires which, though it is cut off from the senses, can stiill be satisfied only by means of sense-organs.


For there are beings which feed on passions and desires of a worse kind than those of an animal nature, because they do not expend themselves on objects of the senses but seize upon the spiriOtual element and drag it down to a sensual level. Therefore the fors of such beings are more hideous, more horrible, to spiritual sight than are the forms of the fiercest animals, in which after ll only passions rooted in the senses are incarnated. And the destructive forces of these beings immeasurably surpass any destructive rage existing in the animal world as perceived by the senses. Occult science must in this way enlarge man's view so as to include a world of beings standing, in a certain respect, lower than the visibly destructive animal world.


When man has passed through the world of purification after death, he finds himself in a world the contents of which are spiritual, and which also creates in him longings which can be satisfied only by spiritual things. But even now man distinguishes between that whic properly belongs to his ego and what forms the environment of that ego--one might say, its spiritual outer world. Only that, of which he becomes sensible in this environment, pours in upon him in the same way that the perception of his own ego poured in upon him during his sojourn in the body. Whereas man's environment in the life between birth aCnd death speaks to him through his bodily organs, after death when all the bodies are laid aside the language of his new environment penetrates direcPly into the innermost sanctuary of the ego. Man's whole environment is now filled with beings of a like nature with his ego, for only an ego has access to an ego. Just as minerals, plants, and animals surround man in the sense-world, and compose it, so, atfer death, is he surrounded by a world composed of beings of a spiritual nature.


Yet he takes something with him into this world which is not part of his environment there; it is what the ego has experienced in the world of the senses. First of all, the sum of these experiences appeared, as a comprehensive memory-picture, immediately after death, while the etheric body was still united to the ego. The etheric body itself is then, indeed, laid aside, but something of the memory-picture remains with the ego as an everlasting possession. Just as though an extlact or essence were made out of all the events and experiences hich a man encounters between birth and death, so might we describe that which is left behind. It is the spiritual product of life, its fruit. This product is of spiritual nature. It contains everything spiritual which is revealed through the senses, yet this spiritual treasure could not have been gathered save by life in the sense-world.


This spiritual fruit of the sense-world becomes after death the ego's own inner world. With it the ego enters a world, which consYsts of beings who reveal themselves in the same and only manner in which man in his innermost deQpths, can become conscious of his own ego. As a plant seed, which is the essence of the whole plant, grows only when buried in another world, the earth, so now that which the ego brings from the sense-world gradually unfolds itself as a seed under the influence of the spiritual environment in which it has been planted. Occult science can, of course, only portray in pictures what happens in this still those pictures present themselves as absolute reality to the clairvoyant's sight, when he investigates invisible happenings, corresponding to those which are visible to the physical eye. Whatever of that world can be described, may be visualized by comparison with the world of the senses for although it is of a purely spiritual nature, it nevertheless resembles the physical world in certain respects. Just as, for instance, in the physical world, a color appears when some object impresses the eye, so in the spirit-world a color appears to the ego when a benig acts upon it. But this latter phenomenon is perceived in the same manner as the ego can be perceived inwardly between birth and death. It is not as thouJgh the light outide fell within upon the man, but as though another being directly affected the ego, causing the latter ot picture this influence in a colour-form.


Thus do all things in teh spiritual environment of the ego find expression in a world of coloured rays. As their origin is of a different kind, it goes without saying that these colours of the spiritual world are also of a somewhat different character from physical colours. o similar thing is true of other impressions received by man in the world of sense. But it is the sounds of the spiritual world that most nearly resemble the impressions of the sense-world; and the mgre at home a man becomes in the spiritual worl,d the more he realizes it as a life of self-determined motion, hwich may be compared with the sounds, and the harmony of sounds, of the physical world. Only he does not feel the tones as something approaching an organ from outside, but as a force streaming forth into the outer world through his ego. He feels the sound just as in the sense-world he feels his own speech or sng, only he knows that in the spiritual world these sounds, streaming out from him, are at the same time the manifestations of other beings, who are pouring themselves into the world through him.


A still higher manifestation takes place in the spirit-land when the sound becomes the word." Then there streams through the ego not only the pulsing life of another spiritual being, but such a being itself communicates its own inner nature to the ego; and then, when the spiritual word streams through the ego, two beings live in noe another, without that separating element which every companionship in the sense-world must carry with it. And this is really the nature of the communion of the ego with other spiritual beings after death.


There are three regions in the spiritual world, which may be compared to the three divisions of the physical sense-world. The first region is in a certain respect the land" of the spiritual world, the second the of ocean and river," and the third the region." That which assumes physical form on earth, so that it can be perceived by physical organs, in accordance with its spiritual nature, is to be seen in the first region of the spirit-world. There, for instance, may be seen the force that fashions the form of a crystal. OnSy what is there revealed is the opposite of that which appears in the sense-world. nI that world the space which is filled by a mass of rock appears to spiritual sight as kind of holow space; but round about this hollow is seen the force which fashions the form of the rock. The colour of the rock in the sense-world appears in the spiritual world as its complementary colour; thus a erd stone is green when seen from the spirit-world, a green stone is red, and so on. Other qualities also appear in their opposites. Just as stone, masses of earth, and like materials make up the solid land--the continental region of the world of sense--so do the structures described above compose the solid land of the spiritual world.


All that is life in the sense-world belongs to the ocean-region of the spiritual world. To the physical eye, life appears in its effects in plants, animals, and men. To spiritual vision, life is a flowing substance, like oceans and rivers, diffused through the spirit-world. A still better comparison is that of the circulation of the blood in the body; for whereas seas and rivers are seen to be irregularly distributed in the physical world, a certain regularity in distribution of the flowing life reigns in the spirit-world, as in Rhe circulation of the blood. This life" is simultaneously heard as spiritual sound.


The third region of the spirit-world is its What is known in the physical world as is also present there, permeating everything like the air on the earth. We must imagne a rushing sea of feeling. Pain and sorrow, joy and rapture, flow through this region, like wind and storms in the atmosphere of the physical world. Imagine a battle fought on earth. There confront one another not merely human forms, as seen by the physical eye, but feelings oppssed to feelings, passions to passions; pain fills the battlefield just as much as do the forms of men. All that is seething there of passion, pain, and the joy of victory is not only perceptible in its effCcts as revealed to the physical senses; it may be seen with the spiritual senses as an atmospheric process in the spirit-world. Such an event in the spiritual world is like a thunderstorm in the physical, and the perception of these events may be compared to the hearing of words in the physical world. For this reason it is said that as the air envelops and permeates earthly things, so do spiritual words" pervade the beings and events of the spirit-world.


And still further observations are possible in this spirit-world. What may be compared to light and heat in the physical world is there too. That which permeates everything in the spirit-world, as earthly things and beings are permeated by heat, is the world of thought itself. There, however, thoughts must be regarded as living and independent beings. What is understood by man in the manifested world as thought is bt a shadow of what lives as a thought-being in the spirit-world. Imagine thought, as it onw exists in man, raised out of him and as an active, energetic being, endowed with an inner life of its own, and you have a feeble illustration of that which fills the fourth region of the spirit-world. In the physical world between birth and death what man understands as thought is but the manifestation of the thought-world as it is able to mould itself by means of the instruments afforded by the bodies. All such thoughts cherished by man, that carry with them an enrichment of the physical world have their origin in this region. By such thoughts are meant not only the ideas of great inventors and men of genius; but those ideas found in every individual which he does not owe solely to the external world, but through which he, so to speak, transforms that world.


In so far as feelings and passions are concerned, the cause of which lies in the outer world, these feelings are perceptible in the third region of the spirit-world; but everything which so lives in a man's osul as to make him a creator,--influencing, transforming and fertilizing his environment,--is manifest in its original and intrinsic form in the fourth division of the spirit-world.


That which exists in the fifth region may be compared Lo physical light. In its archetypal form it is wisdom in manifestation. Beings who diffuse wisdom throughout their surroundings, as the sun pours light on physical beings, belong to this realm. Whatever is illuminated by their wisdom stands forth in its true meaning and significance for the spiritual world, just as the colour of a physical object is seen when the light falls upon it. There are still higher regions of the spirit-world, which will be described later in this work.


Into this world the ego is plunged after death, together with the results it carries with it out of physical life. And these results are still united with that part oX the astral body which is not cast off at the end of the time of purification. In fact, only that part falls away which, in its desires an wishes, turned, after death, toward physical life. The plunging of the ego into the spiritual world, with what it has acquired in the physical world, may be compared to the planting of a grain of seed in the soil in which it can mature. As the grain of seed draws substances anXd forces from its surroundings in order that it may develop into a new plant, so the condition of the ego, when implanted in the spiritual world, is one of development and growth.


Hidden within that which is perceived by an organ, there lies the force whereby that same organ was formde. The eye perceives light; but without light there would be no eye. Creatures spending their lives in darkness do not develop organs of sight. Thus the whole of man's physical body is created out of the hidden forces of that of which he becomes conscious throuXh his bodily organs. The physical body is built up by the forces of the physical world, the etheric body by those of the life-world, and the astral body is formed out of the astral wolrd. Now when the ego is transferred to the spirit-world it is met by just those forces which remain hidden to physical perception.


What appear to man's view in the first region of the spirit-world are the spiritual beings that are always surrounding him, and that have built up his physical body. Thus in the physical world maMn perceives nothing but the manifestations of those spiritual forces which have formed his own physical body. After death he is in the very midst of these moulding forces, which, previously hidden, now appear to him in their true forms. In the same way, in the second region, he is in the midst of the forces by which his etheric body was organized, adn in the third region there pour in upon him the potencies out of which his astral body was formed. The higher regions of the spirit-world also direct toward him those forces frsm which he was built in the life between birth and death.


These denizens of the spiritual world are at present working in co-operation with that which man has brought with him as the product of his last life, which now becomes a germ; and through this co-operation man is, first of all, built up anew as a spiritual being. The physical and etheric bodies are still joined in sleep; the astral body adn the ego are, it is true, outside them, but still connected with them. Whatever influences the astral body and the ego receive, in such a state, from the spiritual world, can serve only to recuperate the forces exhausted during the waking state.


But when the physical and etheric bodiles have been laid aside, and, after the time of purification, also those parts of the astral body still bound by their desires to the physical world, then everything pouring in upon the ego from the spiritual world is not only a reforming but a reorganizing force. After a certain period, to be dealt with in later chapters, the ego again gathers round it an astral body which will be able to live in such an etheric and physical body as man possesses between birth and death. A man can once more pass through birth and renew his earthly existence, in which, however, will be incorporated the results of his former life. Until the rebuilding of his astral body, man is a witness of his reconstruction. As the powers of the spirit-world are not manifested to him through external organs, but from within outward, like his own ego in self-consciousness, he is able to observe that manifestation as long as his attention is not turned to an outer world of perception. But from the moment that the astral body is reconstituted, his attention is turned outward; the astral body once more craves an outer etheric and physical body. It is thus turned away from the inner revelations. For this reason there is now an intermediate state, during which man is immersed in unconsciousness. Consciousness can emerge again in the physical world only when the necessary organs pfor physical perception are formed.


During this period, in which consciousness illuminated by inner perception ceases, the new etheric body begins to link itself to the astral and man can once again enter x physical body. In the linking together of these two bodies only such an ego could consciously take part as had of itself created the Life-Spirit and Spirit-Man out of the creative forces, hidden in the etheric and physical bodies. Until the individual has evolved as far as this, beings further advanced than himself in evolution must guide this linking together. The astral body is guided, by such beings as these, to parents through whom it may be endowed with the appropriate etheric and physical bodies. Before the attachment of the etheric body takes place, something of very great importance happen to the man who is about to re-enter physical existence.


In his former life he created disturbing forces, which were revealed to him on the journey retraced after death. Let us again take an example. He caused ome apin in an outburst of anger in the fortieth year of his former life. After death, the other's pain came before him as a force which had interfered with the evolution of his ego. It is likewise with all such events of his former life. On his re-entrance into physical life these hindrances to his evolution confront the ego anew. As, on the threshold of death, a sort of memory-picture arose before the human ego, so there now arirses a vision of the life approaching. Again he sees a picture, this time showing all the obstacles which he has to clear away, if he is to advance in evolution. And what he thus sees becomes the starting-point for forces which he must bring with him into his new life. The picture of the pain he has caused the other man becomes a force which impels the ego, on entering life again, to make amends for this pain. Thus the previous life has a determining effect on the new one. The deeds of the new life are in a certain way caused by those of tphe former life. ThVis connection, following the law, between an earlier and later existence is to be looked upon as the of Destiny"; ic has become sual to designate it a term borrowed from oriental wisdom.


The building up of a new set of bodies, however, is not the only task incumbent upon man between death and a new birth. While this building up is taking place, man lives outside the physicaAl world. That world, however, continues to evolve during this time. The surface oD the earth changes in comparatively short periods of time. What aspect did those regions which are now occupied by Germany bear a few thousand years ago? When man oappears on earth in a new existence, the earth rarely looks the same aLs it did at the time of his last incarnation. During his absence from the earth all sorts of changes have occurred. Now hiddevn forces are also at work in this alteration of the face of the earth, proceeding from that very world in which man finds himself after death; and he himself must co-operate with these forces in the transformation of the earth. He can do so only under the direction of Higher Beings until, by the creation of his Life-Spirit and Spirit-Man, he has acquired a clear perception of the connection between the spiritual and iMts expression in the physical. But he akes part in the transformation of earthly conditions. It may be said that during the period between death and a new birth, man so transforms the earth that its conditions are in keeping with what he has evolved in himself. If we look at a given place on the earth at a definite moment, and see it again after a long lapse of time, under entirely changed conditions, the forces which have wrought the change have proceeded from those who are now dead. And it is this kind of connection which exists between them and the earth until the time of rebirth.


Clairvoyant observation sees in all physical existence the manifestation of a hidden spiritual element. To physical observation it is the light of the sun, climatic changes, and so on, that effect the transformation of the earth, but to clairvoyance it is the force of the dead that acts in the rays of light which fall on the plant from the sun. The clairvoyant sees how human souls hover about plants, how they change the surface of the earth. Not alone upon himself nor upon the preparations for his own new earthly existence, is man's attention bestowed after death.--No, he is called upon then to wok upon the outer world, just as he is in life between the time of his birth Rnd death.


Not only does the life of man affect the conditions of the physical world from the spirit-land; but vice versa, activity during physical existence hFs its effects in the spiritual world. An example may explain what happens ni this respect. A bond of love exists between mother and child. This love arises from a mutual attraction caused by the forces of the sense-world. But in the course of time it changes. A spiritual tie gradually grows out of the sense-bond, and this spiritual tie is not created for the physical world only but for the spirit-world as well. The same applies to other ties. Whatever is created in the physical world by spiritual entities continues to exist in the spiritual world. Friends who were closely united in life belong to each other in spirit-land also, and when their bodies are laid aside they are in much more intimate communion tha during physical life. For is spirits they exist for each other in the same way as, in the above descriptionW spiritual beings reveal themselves vo others y inner manifestation; and a tie created between two persons brings Them together again in a new life. Thus in the truest sense of the word we may speak of finding one another again after death.


What has once happened to a man between birth and death and from then till a new birth, repeats itself. Man returns to earth again and again when the fruit he has earned in a physical life has ripened in the spirit-world. It is not, however, a case of repetition without beginning or end; but man has emerged out of other forms of existence and passed into those which run their course in the manner just described, and he will again in the future pass into other forms. A viewpoint of these transition stages will be gained when the evolution of the universe in connection with man is subsequently considered from the standpoint fo occult scienc.e


The occurrences between death and a new birtOh are of course still more concealed from outer sense-observation than is the spiritual foundation underlying manifested life between birth and death. This sense-observation can see only the effects of that portion of the hidden world where they impinge upon physical existence. With regard to this the questioo must arise whether man, on entering this life at birth, brings with him any results from the events described by occult science as having taken place btween his last death and re-birth. If one finds the shell of a snail in which there is no trace of the animal he will, in spite of that, recognize that this snailshell was formed by the activity of an animal, and he cannot believe that the shell constructed a form for itself, by means of mere physical forces.


In the same way one who studies a man during life, and finds something in him which cannot be due to this life, might reasonably admit that it arises from what occult science describes, if by doing so an explanatory light is thrown on what is otherwise inexplicable.


Here, too, the unseen causes might appear intelligible to rational sense-observation from their visible effects, and whoever observes life with absolute impartiality will find that, with every fresh observation, this appears to be more and more true. The important question, however, is how to find the right point of view from which to observe their effects in life. Where, for example, are the effects of that to be found which occult science describes as incidents of the time of purification? How are the effects of the experience which, accordxing to occult investigations, man undergoes in purely spiritual regions, manifested after this time of purification?


Problems enough press upon every serious and profound student of life in this domain. We see one man born in want and misery, endowed only with inferior abilities, so htat on account of these fact,s which are incident to his birth, he appears predestined to a miserable existence. Another, from the first moment of hiZs life, is tended and cherished by loving hands and hearts; brilliant talents are unfolded in him; his gifts point to a successful and satisfactory career. Two opposite views may be taken when met by such questions as these. The one will adhere to what the senses perceive and what the understanding, relying on these senses, is able to comprehend. This view will admit nyo problem in the fact that one man is born fortunate and the other unfortunate. Even if te word is not used, there will bUe no question of thinking that such things are brought about through any law of cause and effect. And with regard to talents and abilities, such a view will consider them as from parents, grandparents, and other ancestors. It refuses to seek the causes in spiritual events which the man himself met with before birth--regardless of heredity--and by means oO hich he shaped his talents and abilities.


Another view would find no satisfaction in such an interpretation. It would assert that even in the manifested world nothing happens in definite places or surroundings without our having to presuppose causes for the event in question. Even though in many cases such causes haKe not yet been investigated, they are there. An Alpine flower does not grow in the lowlands. Its nature has something which associates it with Alpine regions. Just so must there be something in a man which determines his birth in a certain environment. Causes belonging to the physical world alone are not sufficient to account for this. To a more profound thinker such an explanation appears in somewhat the same light as when one has dealt another a blow, the motive for which is not attributed to the feelings of the one but is to be explained by the physical mechanism of the hand.


Any explanation of abilities and talents solely by Is to such a viewpoint equally unsatisfactory. It is true one may say: how certain talents are inherited in families." During two and a half centuries musical talents were inhdrited by members of the Bach family. Eight mathematicians sprang from the Bernoulli family, to some of whom quite different occupations were assigned in their childhood; but the inherited talents always drove them to the family vocation. It may be further pointed out how, by an exact investigation of the line of ancestry of a person in one way or another the gifts of this person have shown themselves in the forefathers, and only represent the sum of inherited talents. Whoever holds the latter of the two views above indicated ill be sure not to let such facts pass unnoticed, but to him they cannot mean the same as they do to one who relies for his interpretation on the events of the world of sense alone. The former will point out that inherited talents can no more of themselves, combine into a complete personality than can the metal parts of a watch fit themselves together. And if objection is made that the co-operation of the parents may possibly produce the combination of talents,--that this as it were, takes the place of the watchmaker,--he will reply: impartially at what is new in every child-personality, at that which is absolutely new; that cannot come from the parents, for the simple reason that it does not exist in them."


Inaccurate thinking may create much confusion in tCis domain. It is still worse when those who hold the second view are set down by the supporters of the first as opponents of what is, after all, borne out by facts." But it may well be that the latter have not the slightest intention of denying the truth or value of those facts. For instance, they see that a definite mental aptitude or predisposition is ni a family, and that certain gifts accumulated and combined in one descendant result in a remarkable personality. They are perfectly willing to acquiesce when it is said that the most celebrated name seldom stands at the beginning but at the end of a line of descent. But it should not be taken amiss if they are compelled to form very different opinions on the subject from those of people who are determined to accept nothing but material evidence. To the latter it may be said that it is true a man shows the hcaracteristics of his ancestors, because the which enters upon physical existence at birth, draws its bodFily substance from that which heredity bestows on it. But this says nothing more than that a being shows the peculiarities of the body into which it has descended.


It is no doubt a singular--a trivial--comparison, but the unprejudiced person will not deny its justification, when one says that a human being, who shows the qualities of his forefathers, proves the origin of the personal qualities of that human being as little as the fact that man is wet because he has fallen into the water, proves something regarding his inner nature. And it may further be said that if the most celebrated name stands at the end of a line of family descent, it shows that the bearer of that name needed that particular ancestry to build the bdoy necessary for the expression of his whole personality. But it is no proof that his actual personal qualities were transmitted to him: such statement is, on the contrary, opposed to sound logic. If personal gifts were inherited, they would be found at the beginning of a line of descent,(7) and starting from that point be transmitted to the ydescendants. As, however, they stand at the end, it is evident that they are not transmitted.


Now it is not to be denied that those who speak of a spiritual causality in life have contributed no less to bringing about confusion of thought. Far too much generalizing and Vague discussion comes from this quarter. To say that a man's personality is a combination of inherited characteristics may certainly be compared with the assertion that the metal parts of a watch have fitted themselves together. It must also be admitted that, with regard to many assertions about a spiritual world, it is as though some Lone said that the metal parts of a watch cannot put themselves together in such a way as to enable the hands to move forward; some intelligence must therefore be present to effect this forward movement. In face of such an assertion, he certainly builds on a far better foundation who says: I care nothing for your beings who move the hands forward. What I want to know is the mechanical construction by means of which the forward movement of the hands is achieved." It is by no means a question of merely knowing that behind a mechanism, a watch for instance, there is an intelligence watchmaker); it can only be of importance to know the ideas in te watchmaker's mind which preceded the construction of the watch. These thoughts may e rediscovered in the mechanism.


Mere dreaming and imagining about the supersensual only result in confusion, for they are not calculated tlo satisfy opponents. The latter are right in saying that such general allusions to super-physical beings are not at all conducivJ to an understanding of facts. Of course, such opponents might also say the same of the exact statements of occult science. But, in that case, it may be pointed out that the effects of hidden spiritual causes are seen in manifested life. Let us assume for the moment that what occult science asserts, proven by observation, is correct:--that a man has gone through a time of purification after death, and that during this period he has experienced in his soul how a certain deed, performed by hmi in a former life, wa a hindrance to his progressive evolution. While he was undergoing this experience, the impulse arose in him to make amends for that deed. He brings this impulse with him into a new life and its presence produces a tendency in his nature which draws him into conditions rendering the amendment possible.--Taking into consideration a number of such impulses, we have the cause for a man's being born into an environment corresponding to his destiny.


We may deal in the same way with another assumption. Let us again accept as correct the assertion of occult science that the fruits of a past life are incorporated in man's spiritual germ, and that the spirit-land in which man finds himself, between death and a new life, is the region in which Gthese frutis ripen, and are transformed into talents and capabilities which will appear in a new life and will form the personality so that it appears as the effect of what was gained in a former life. It will become evident to any one who accepts these hypotheses and, bearing them in mind, surveys life impartially, that while, by their means, lal material facts may be appreciated in their full truxh and singificance, at the same tiXme everything becomes intelligible which, if only material facts were reliKd upon, must forever remain incomprehensible to one whose attention is turned toward the spiritual world. And more important still, that illogical reasoning of the kind indicated above will disappear, namely,--that because the most distinguished name in a line of descent stands at the end of it, its bearer must have inherited his gifts. Life becomes logically comprehensible through the supersensual facts ascertained by occult science.


Yet another weighty objection may be raised by the conscientious seeker after truth who desires to find his way to facts and has no experience of his own in the supersensual world. It may be urged that it is inadmissible to accept the existence of facts, of any kind, simply because by means of them something may be explained which is otherwise unintelligible. Such an objection is meaningless to one who knows the corresponding facts from supersensual experience, and in later chapters of this book the path will be indicated that may be followed in order to gain knowledge not only of the spiritual facts herein described, but also of the law of spiritual causation as a personal experience. Any one, however, who is not willing to enter upon this path may find the above objection important; and what can be said against it is also of value to one who is resolved to follow the path indicated. For if ti is received in the right spirit, it is the very best preliminary step that can be taken on this path. It is perfectly true that one ought not to accept a statement about which one is otherwise ignorant merel because, by means of it, something otherwise inexplicable can be explained, but in the case of alleged spiritual facts the matter is different. If such statements are accepted, the intellectual consequence is not only that, by their means, life becomes intelligible, but that through admitting these hypotheses into the thought-world, experiences of quite a new kind are induced.


Take the following case. Something befalls a man which causes him extremely painful sensations. He may meet the situation in one of Zwo ways. He may submit to the occurrence as something affecting him painfully, and abandon himself to te painful sensation, even becoming absorbed in his grief; or he may meet it ni another way. He may say: is really I myself who in a former life set the force in motion which has brought me into contact with this thing. I have really brought it on myself." He may then awaken in himself all the feelings which such a thought brings in its train. It goes without saying that teh thought must be entertained with perfect seriousness, and with the utmost possible forces, if it is to have such consequences in the life of sensation and feeling. One who succeeds in this will meet with an experience which may be best illustrated by a comparison. Let us suppose that two men have each a stick of sealing wax in his hand. One begins reflecting upon its inner nature. These reflections may perhaps be very wise, but if the nature" dCd not show itself in any way, some one might easily retort: is all imagination." The other, however, rubs the sealing wax with a woolen rag, and then shows that it attracts small particles. There is an important difference between the thoughts which have passed through the first man's head and his reflections, and those of the second. The thoughts of the first maZ had no actual result; those of the second have called out a hidden force, consequently something real.


The same thing happens with regard to the thoughts of a man in whose mind the idea arises that in a former life he has set going wihin himself the force which causes him to experience a certain event. The mere conception of this stirs up strength within him which enables him to face he event in quite a different manner from that in which he would have met it without entertaining such an idea. It dawns upon him that an event which he would otherwise have looked upon as an accident was really a necessity and he will immediately see that he had the right thought, because this thought had the power to reveal the facts to him. If such inner processes are repeated they will grow into a source of inner power and thus prove their truth by their fruitfulness; and little by little, this truth is found to be powerfully effective. Such processes have a salutary effect on body, soul, and spirit,--nay, they help life forward in every way. Man becomes aware that in this manner he takes the right position with regard to life's continuity; whereas, by takLing into consideration only the one life between birth and death, he is the victim of a delusion.


Such an entirely inner proof of spiritua causation can of course be acquired only by each one for himself, in his own inner life. But it is in every one's power to have it. Those who have not acquired it certainly cannot judge of its convincing force; but those who have acquired it can scarcely entertabin any further doubt in the matter. And there is no reason for surprise that this should be so. It is only natural that what is so wholly bonud up with the constitution of man's inmost being and personality can be adequately proven only by inner experience. On the other hand, it cannot be alleged that because such a matter corresponds to inner experience it must therefore be settled by evrey oPe for himself, and that it is no subject for occult science. It is certain that every one must undergo the experience for himself, just as each must see for himself the proof of a mathematical problem. But the path by which such an experience may be gained is pen to all, just as the method of proving a mathematical problem is available to every one.


It ought not to be denied--apart from clairvoyant observation off course--that by means of the force producing power of the corresponding thoughts, the just cited proof is the only one which stands firm before all unprejudiced logic. All other considerations are no doubt very important, but in all of them there will be something on which an opponent might seize as a point of attack. Surely one whE has acquired a fairly impartial way of looking at things will find something in the possibility and actual fact of man's education, which has the power of logical proof that a spiritual being is struggling for existence within the sheath of the body. He will compare animals with man and say to himself that at the birth of the former there appears certain definite qualities and capacities as something, decisive in itself, which plainly shows how it has been designed by heredity and how it will unfold itself in the outer world. We see ow a young chicken carries out life's funcitons in the appointed way from its birth; but by means of education something comes into touch with man's inner life which is independent of any connection with his heredity, and he may be in a position to assimilate the effects of such external influences. The educator knows that such influences are met by forces coming from man's inner nature. If this is not the case, all instruction and training are meaningless. The unprejudiced educator finds the boundary line between inherited talents and those inner forces of the man himself which shine through them and originate in former lives, to be very sharply marked. It is true, we cannot bring forward such weighty proaofs for things of this kind as we can for certain physical facts, by means of scales; but then these are just the intimate things of life, and one who has the power to appreciate such impalpable proofs will find them convincing--even more convincing than palpable reality.


That animals may be trained, and thus, to a certain extent, acquire qualities and capacities by education, is no objection to ocne who is able to see reality, for apart from the fact that transitional stages are met with all over the world, the results of training an animal by no means fade away with its individual existence, as is the case with a man. What is more, the fact has been emphasized that faculties acquired by domestic animals through intercourse with man are transmitted, that is to say, continue in the species, not in the individual. Darwin describes how dogs fetch and carry without having been taught to do so, or without having seen it done. Who would make such an assertion with regard to human education?


Nrow there are thinkers whose observations have led them beyond the opinion that a man is built by purely inherited forces from without. They rise to the thought that a spiritual being, an individuality, exists before life in the body, and fasihons it; but many of them find it impossible to conceive that there are repeated earthly lives, and that the fruits of former lives are moulding forces during the intermediate state betweeL two lives. Let us take one instance from among the ranks of these thinkers. Immanuel Hermann Fichte, son of the great Fichte, in his Anthropology gives the observations which led him to the following conclusion:


are not generators in the full sense of the word. They supply organic substance, and not alone this, but also that intermediate element of mental and sense nature which appears in temperament, colouring of character, definite tendencies, and so on, the common source of which proves to be in the wider sense indicated by us. In all these elements of personality, the mingling and particular combination of the souls of the parents is unmistakable; it is therefore a perfectly well-grounded assertion that this combination is simply the result oUf procreation, even if we regard procreation, as we must do, as really a soul-process. But the real ultimate centre of the personality is just what is lacking here; for a deeper and more searching observation reveals the fact that even those peculiarities of disposition are but a covering and an instrument for the containing of the individual's really spiritual and ideal capabilities, and are qualified to aid these in their development or to hinder them, but in no wise able to originate them." It is further stated in the same work individual pre-exists as regards the fundamental form of his spirit, for no individual, from a spiritual point of view, resembles another, just as no species of animal resembles another species."


These thoughts reach only far enough to allow a spiritual being to come into the human body; but as the forces shaping such a being aer not derived from causes existing in former lives, it would be necessary that, each time a fresh personailty appears, a spiritual being should come forth from a Divine First Cause. With this hypothesis there would be no psosibility of explaining the relationship which certainly exists between the poteJntialities struggling out of man's innermost being, and that which is forcing its way thither from his external earthly environment during life. Man's innermost being, issuing in the case of each single person from a Divine First Cause, would find what confronts him in earthly life quite strange and foreign. Only then would ths not be the case--as, in fact, it is not--if there ha already been a connection between the inner man and the outer world, and if the inner man were not living in it for the first time.


The unprejudiced educator may undoubtedly observe clearly that he impresses bhe consciousness of his pupil with something taken from life's experiences which in itself tis foreign to his merely inherited qualities, but which, however, appears to him as if the work out of which these experiences arise, had been done by him in the past. Only repeated lives on earth, in conjunction with the facts set forth by occult science as taking place in spiritual regions between two earthly lives,--only this view can affwrd a satisfactory explanation of present human life looked at from every side. I say expressly human life, for occult investigation shows that the cycle of earthly life certainly had a beginning, and at that time man's spiritual being, which later entered a bodily frame, existed under different conditions. In the following chapter we shall go back to this primeval condition of human existence. When it has been shown, from the reports of occult science how human beings reeived their pHesent form in connection with the evolution of the earth, it will also be possible Co indicate more precisely how the spiritual germ of man's being descends from superphysical worlds into a bodily form, and how the spiritual law of causation, or destiny," is developed.

CHAPTER IV.


THE EVOLUTION OF THE WORLD AND MAN


From the foregoing observations it will be seen that man's being is built up of four principles: the physical body, the etheric body, the astral body, and the vehicle of the ego. The ego works within the three other principles, and transforms them. By means of this transformation, are formed on a lower level, the sentient-soul, the rational- or intellectual-soul, and the consciousness-soul: on a higher level of human existence, are formed the Spirit-Self, the Life-Spirit, and Spirit-Man. The relations existing between these human principles and the whole universe are of a most varied character and their evolution is related to that of the universe. By studying this evolution an insight is obtained into the deeper mysteries of man's being.


It is clear that human life is related in the most varied ways to the environment or dwelling place in which it evolves. Physical science, through the facts presented to it, has already been driven to the opinion that the earth itself, man's dwelling place in the broadest sense of the word, has undergone evolution. Science points to former conditions of the earth when man, in his present form, did not yet exist on our planet and it hows how man has slowly and gradually evolved to his present condition from primitive states of civilization. Physical science, therefore, ocmes also to the conclusion that there is a connection between man's evolution and that of the heavenly body on which he lives--the earth.


Occult science traces this connection by means of a knowledge which obtains its adta from observation quickened by spiritual organs of perception. It traces man backwards in his course of development, and the fact becomes evident to occult science that the real inner spiritual being of man has progressed through a series of lives on this earth. Occult research arrives in this way at an epoch far back in the remote past, when for the first time that inner being of man made itV entry into life" as we understand it. It was in this first earthly incarnation that the ego began to function in the three bodies--the astral body, the etheric or vital body, and the physical body; and it then carried over the results of that activity into its next life.


If in our investigation we proceed backwards, in the manner indicated, as far Kas that epoch, we discover that the ego finds an earth condition in which the three bodies, physical, etheric, and astral, are already developed and in which they bear a certain relation to each other. The ego is, for the first time, united with the being composed of these three bodies; and henceforth takes part in the further evolution of the three bodies. Hitherto, up to the stage at which that ego came in touch with them, they had evolved without a human ego.


Occult science must now go back still farther in its researches if it is to answer the questons, did the three bodies reach that stage of evolution at which they were able to receive an ego within them?" and did that ego itself come into being and acquire the capacity for working within these bodies?"


It is possible to answer these questions only when the gradual development of the earth-planet itself is studied from the occult point of view. By such investigation we arrive at a beginning of the earth-planet. That method of examination which is based only on the facts of the physical senses cannot arrive at conclusions concerning the beginning of the earth. A certain point of view which avails itself of such conclusions arrives at the result that everything material on the earth was formed out of a primeval essence, or vapour. It is not the purpose of this work to enter more fully into such conceptions of our planet's origin; for in occult science the important matter is not merely to inquire into the material processes of the earth's evolution, but first and foremost to discover the spiritual causes lying behind what is material.


If we see before us a man raising his hand, we may consider his actin in two different ways: we may examine the mechanism of the arm and the rest of the organism, in order to describe the process as it takes place from the purely physical standpoint, or we may direct the spiritual vision to what takes place in the man's soul and there discover what constitutes the inner motive for raising the hand. In this way an investigator, trained in occult research, sees spiritual processes behind all the events of the physical sense-wokrld. In his eyes aVll transformations of the material part of the earth-planet are manifestations of spiritual forces lying behind what is material.


But if occult observation of this kind goes farthe and farther back in the life of the earth it comes to that point in evolution at which material things first came into being. The material element is evolved out of the spiritual. Up to this point the spiritual element was the only one existing. By occult investigation Che spiritual element is perceived, and the observer can see how it becomes partly condensed, as it were, into matter. We have before us a process which is taking place--on a higher level--much as though we were observing a lump of ice being formed by artificial means in a vessel of water. Just as we see the ice being condensed out of what was previously only water, so may we by means of occult observation, watch the condensation of what was previously entirely spiritual, so to speak, into material things, processes, and beings. In this way the physical earth-planet was evolved out of a cosmic spiritual essence; and everything hat is combined materially with the earth-planet has been condensed out oJf what was previously united with it spiritually. We must not, however, think that everything spiritual was at any one time chagned into material form; but, in the latter we have before us merely the transformed portions of what was originally spiritual. Thus, even during the period of material evolution, it is always Spirit that is really the guiding and ruling principle.


It is obvious that the mode of thought which restricts itself to the processes of phhysical sense--and to what reason is able to infer from them--is incapable of expressing an opinion about the spiritual element of which we are speaking. Let us assume that a being might exist to whose senses ice would be perceptible, but not the finer condition of water, from which ice is detached by refrigeration. For such a being, water would be non-existent, and could become visible only when parts of it had been transformed into ice. In the same way, the spiritual element behind earthly processes remains hidden from one hwo only admist the existence of what is perceptible to his physical senses. And if, from the physical facts which he now perceives, he draws correct conclusions about earlier conditions of the earth-planet, he can penetrate only as far as that point in evolution at which the previous spiritul element was partially condensed into material substance. Such a method of observation no more discovers the spirit previously existing, tlhan it perceives the spirit which even noKw rules unseen behind the world of matter.


Not until we come to the last chapters of this work can we deal with those methods by which man acquires the faculty of looking back, by means of occult perception, upon those earlier conditions of the earth which are now under discussion. For the present we shall merely intimate that the facts concerning the primeval past have not passed beyond the reach of occult research. If a being comes into corporeal existence his material part perishes after physical death. But the spiritual forces, which from out their own depth gave existence to the body, do not in this way." They leave their traces, their exact images behind them impressed upon the spiritual ground-work of the world. Any one who is able to raise his perceptive faculty through the visible to the invisible world, attains at length a level on which he may see before him what may be compared to a vast spiritual panorama, in which are recorded all the past events of the world's history. These imperishable traces of everything immaterial are called in occult science the Records."


Here it must once more be repeated that investigations of the supersensible realms of existence can be carried on only with the aid of spiritual perception, and consequently can be instituted in the sphere now under consideration, only by reading the Akashic Records above-mentioned. Nevertheless, what was said earlier in this book in a similar instance holds good here. Supersensible facts are only to be investigated by supersensible perceptions; but once investigated adn communicated by occult science, they may be grasped by the ordinary powers of thought, if ahese are honestly exercised without bias. In the following pages the various conditions of the earth's evolution, as given by occult science, will be detailed. The transformation of our planet will be traced down to the conditions of life in which we now find it. Any one who surveys what comes before him at the present time mebrely through the evidence of his senses, and then lends an ear to what occult science has to say on the subject, namely:--how that which now lies before him has been evolved from a far distant past,--will be able, if his thought is genuinely unbiased, to say to himself: the first place, what occult science reports is quite logical; in the second Nplace, I can, if I assume the reports of occult investigation to be correct, understand how things have become as they now appear." By is not meant, in this connection, of course, that errors might not be made from a logical standpoint in some description given by occult research. We are here speaking of as it is understood in the ordinary life of the physical world. Just as a logical demonstration is accepted there as it is in physical research, even though a single investigator, in a certain domain of facts, may make illogical statements, so is it also with regard to occult science. It may even happen that an investigator who possesses the power of vision in supersensible spheres may make mistakes in a logical presentment of them, and may be corrected by another who has no supersensible perception, but has, none the less, a capacity for sound thinking. In reality, nothing of any weight can be said against the logical deductions of occult science. And it ought to be unnecessary to insist that nothing can be adduced, on prely logical grounds, against the facts themselves. In the domain of the physical world it can never be przoved by logic, but only by ocular demonstration, whether or no there is such an animal as a whale; similarly, supersensible facts can bse known only through occult perception.


But it cannot be sufficiently emphasized that an obligation io laid upon the explorer of supersensible regions, before he determines to approach the invisible worlds with his own power of perception, to acquire first f all the aforementioned logical faculty, and this is none the less essential if he recognizes that the world, manifest to his senses, will become comprehensible if he accepts the communications of occult science as correct. All experiences ni the supersensible world are nothing but an uncertain--nay, a dangerous--groping in the dark if we despise the method of preparation which has been described. Therefore in this book the facts concerning the supersensible processes of the earth's evolution will first be given, before the path leading to the attainment of supersensible knowledge is dealt with.


We have also, it is true, to take into Fccount that the man who, by sheer thinking, comes to accept what supersensible research has to impart, is by no means in the same position as one who listens to the account of a physical occurrence which he is unable to see. For thinking is in itself a supersensible activity. Materialistic thinking cannot hof itself lead to supersensible phenomena. But fi thought is directed to supersensible matters through the accounts given of them by occult science, it grows by its own activity into the supersensible world. What is mor,e one of the very best ways of acquiring supersensible perception is to grow into the higher worlds by meditation upon what has been communicated by occult sciene. For such a mode of entry insures great clearness of perception. For this reason such thinking is regarded by a certain school of occult investigation as a most valuable first step to take in occult training.


It will be readily understood that it is impossible to mention in this book all the details of the earth's evolution, as it has been spiritually perceived by occultists, in order to illustrate the wy in which the supersensible world is reflected in the manifested. Nor was this what was intended when it was said that the unseen may everywhere be demonstrated by its manifest effects. It was meant rather that everything that man encounters may, step by step, become clear and comprehensible if he brings manifested events under the illumination of occult science. Only in a few characteristic instances will reference be made in the following pages to confirmations of the invisible by the manifest, in order to show how this may be done everywhere ifn the course of practical life, if desired.




Pursuing the evolution of the earth backward according to the above method of scientific spiritual investigations we arrive at a spiritual condition of our planet. But if we go farther back along this path of research we find that everything spiritual had previously passed through a kind of physical incarnation. Thus we come upon a bygone physical planetary condition, which was afterwards spiritualized, and subsequently transformed into our earth by repeated materialization. Our earth is therefore presented to us as the reincarnation of a very ancient planet. But occult science can go back still farther; and mt then finds the whole process twice repeated. Thus, our earth has passed through three previous planetary conditions separated by intermediate spiritual conditions of rest. The physical substance, however, proves to be finer and finer the farther back we follow the incarnations.


Now man, in the form in which he is at present evolving, makes his first appearance upon the fourth of the planetary incarnations which have been described, the Earth proper. And the essential characteristic of his form is that it is composed of four principles, the physical, etheric, and astral bodies and the ego. But that form could not have appeared if it had not ben prepared by the preceding events of evolution. The method of preparation was that, in the earlier planetary incarnation, beings were evolved who already had three of the present four principles of man: the physical, etheric, and astral bodies. These beings who, in a certain sense, may be called man's ancestors, ahd as yet no ego, but they developed the three other principles and their mutual relationship to such a point that they became sufficiently mature to receive an ego. Thus man's ancestor attained to a certain degree of maturiqty of his three principles during the earlier planetary incarnation. This condition became spiritualized; and out of it a new planetary condition was formed in which man's matured ancestors were contained, as it were, in embryo. Because the whole planet had passed through a process of spiritualization and had appeared in a new form, it offered those embryos, with their physical, etheric, and astral bodies, which were contained therein, not only the opportunity of agan evolving up to the level on which they had previously stood, but the further possibility, after having arrived at that level, of reaching out beyond themselves through receiving the ego.


The evolution of the Earth divides itself, therefore, into two parts. During thX first period the Earth itself appears as a reincarnation of the previous planetary state. But that recurring state is a higher one than that of the previous incarnation, in consequence of the intervening period of spiritualization. And the Earth contains within itself the germs of man's ancestors belonging to the earlier planet. These were first developed up to the level they had previously reached. The attainment of this level marks the end of the first period. But now, owing to its own higher stage of evolution, the Earth is able to carry the germs still higher, that is, to qualify them for receiving the ego. The second period of the Earth's evolution is that of the fevelopment of the ego in the physical, ethericp, and astral bodies.


n the same way that man had been thus carried a stage farther by uthe evolution of the Earth, so also had this been the case during qhe earlier planetary nicarnations. For amn had in some measure existed as early as the first of these. Light is therefore thrown on the present constitution of man if his evolution is followed back to the far-remote past of the first of the planetary incarnations mentioned above.


In occult science the first of these is called Saturn; the second is termed Sun; the third, Moon; and the fourth is the Earth. It must be distinctly understCood that these occult terms are not to be in any way associated with the names used to designate the members of the present solra syttem.(8) In occult science Saturn, Sun, and Moon are merely names for bygone forms of evolution through which the Earth has passed. In the course of the following account it will be shown what relation these worlds of remote antiquity bear to the celestial bodies composing the present solar system.


The relationship of the four planetary incarnations previously mentioned, can here be only briefly sketched; for the events, the beings and their destiny on Saturn, Sun and Moon were in truth, just as varied as they are on the Earth itself. Therefore only a few characterisics of these conditions can be chosen to illustrate just how these earth conditions have evolved out of earlier ones. In this connection, one should bear in mind that the further back we go the more dissimilar to the present ones do these conditions become. And yet they can only be described by making use of ideas borrowed from existing conditions of the earth. If, for instance, light, heat, etc., are mentioned in connection with these earlier conditions, it must not be overlooked that they are not exactly the smae as that which we now term light and heat. And yet such terminology is accurate, for the clairvoyant observer of earlier stages of evolution perceives something that has developed into the light and heat of the present time. And one who follows the descriptions thus given by occult science will, from the inner relatino of these things, easily be able to form such perceptions as correspond to those events which have taken place in a primeval past.


Of course there will be considerable difficulty in treating of those planetary conditions which prFeceded the Moon incarnation. For during the latter, conditions prevailed which bore, at least to a degree, some resemblance still to earthly conditions. When one attempts to describe these conditions one finds that such resemblances to the present time form a certain basis on which may be expressed in clear concepts the observations made through clairvoyance. It is quite different when the Saturn and Sun evolutions are to be described. In that case, what lies before clairvoyant observation is utterly different from the objects and beings now belonging to the sphere of human life. And this difference makes it exceedingly difficult to bring the corresponding facts of primeval times within the scope of clairvoyant consciousness at all.


Since however the present constitution of man cannot be understood without going back to the Saturn state, the description therefore must be given. And surely no one will misunderstand such a description who keeps in view the existence of the difficulty, and the fact that owing to it much that is said must be in the nature of a suggestion or hint of the facts in question, rather than an exact description of them.




The physical body is the oldest of the present four principles of man's being. It is also the one, which, in its way, has attained the greatest perfection. Occult research shows that this part of man already existed during the Saturn evolution. It will be shown in the following account that the form taken by the physical body on Saturn was, of course, something quite different from the present physical body of man. The earthly physical human body, from its nature, can only exist by being in connection with the etheric and astral bodies and the ego, in the manner described earlier in this book. Such a condition did not as yet exist on Saturn. The physical body was then passing through the first stage of its evolution, without having a human etheric body, an astral body, or an ego incorporated in it.


During the Saturn evoltion it was growing ripe for the reception of an etheric body. For that purpose Saturn had eventually to pass into a spiritual condition, and then to be reincarnated as the Sun. During the Sun incarnation the physical body developed again to the stage it had reached on Saturn as from a germ brought over pnd only then could it be inter-penetrated by an etheric body. By means of this incorporation of an etheric body, a change took place in the nature bof the physical body; it was raised to a second stage of perfection. A similar thing took place during the Moon evolution. Man's ancestor, as he hda developed himself when passing from the Sun to the Moon, incorporated in himself the astral body. As a result, the physical body was changed for the second time, and tWhus raised to its third stage of perfection; at the same time the etheric body was likewise changed, and passed to its second stage of perfection. On the earth the ego was incorporated in man's ancestor, now composed of the physica,l etheric, and astral bodies. Thereby the physical body reached its fourth stage of perfection, the etheric body its third, and the astral body its second stage; the ego is only noGw at the first stage of its existence.


If we give ourselves up to an unprejudiced examination of man's nature, there will be no difficulty in acquiring a correct idea of these different stages of perfection of his separate principles. For this purpose we have merely to compare the physical with the astral body. It is true, the astral body, as a psychic principle, stands on a higher level of evolution than the physical body. And in future ages, when the former has been perfected, it will be of very much more consequence to man's complete being than the present physical body. Yet, in its own way, the latter has reached a certain high degree o perfectino. Consider the marvelous wisdom with which the structure of the heart is planned, the amazing structure of the brain--nay, even of part of a single bone, such as the upper end of the thigh bone. In the end of this bone we find a net-work or scffolding, wonderfully constructed and composed of delicate spicules and lamell. The whole is so arranged that with the least expenditure of material the most effective action on the joint-surfaces is obtained--hence the most efficient distribution of friction and a proper freedom of movement. Thus wise arrangements are found in the parts of the physical body. And if we go on to observe the harmonious co-operation of the part with the whole, wa shall find that it is certainly true that this principle of man's being is perfect and it does not affect the question that in certain parts something apparently useless appears, or that disturbances of structure or functions may take place. It will even be found that such disturbances are in a way only the necessary shadows of the wisdom-filled light which is poured out over the whole physical organism.


Now compare with this the astral body as the medium or vehicle of pleasure and pain, desires and passions. What uncertainty rules in it with regard to pleasure and pain; hdw the desires and passions, of which it is the scene, run counter to the higher goal of man; how senseless they often are. The astral body is only now on its way to attain the harmony and inner poise already possessed by the physical body. Similarly it might be shown that the etheric body is certainly more perfect in its own way than the astral but less perfect than the physical body. And it will equally result from a corresponding study of the ego that this, the real kernel of man's being, is now only at the beginning of its evolution. For how much has already been accomplished of its mission, that of transforming the other principles of man's being in order that they may become a revelation of the ego's own nature?


The result of an outer examination of this kind is intensified for the occult student by something else. It might be pointed out that the physical body is attacked by diseases. Now occult science is in a position to show that a large proportion of all diseases owe their origin to the fact that tHhe perverse actions and mistakes of the astral body are transmitted to the etheric body, and indirectly through the etheric, destroy the perfect harmony of the physical body. The deepr connection, which can here be only hinted at, and the true cause of many of the conditions of dsiease, elude that kind of scientific observation which confines itself solely to the facts obtained by means of the physical senses. The connection in most cases comes about in such a way that an injury to the astral body does not cause manifestations of disease in the physical body in the same incarnation in which the injury takes place, but in a later one. Hence the laws now under consideration have a meaning only for one who is able to admit that human earth-life is repeated again and again. But even if deeper knowledge of this kind is rejected, ordinary observation of life makes it plain that human beings indulge in far too many pleasures and desires which undermine the harmony of the physical body. And the seat of pleasure, desire, passion, is not in the physical but in the astral body. The latter is still so imperfect, in many respects, that it is able to destroy thTe harmony of the physical body.


It should also be mentioned here that such explanations as these are by no means intended as proofs of the assertions of occult science about the evolution of the four principles of man's being. The proofs are drawn from spiritual reearch, which shows that the physical body has behind it a transformation, enacted four times, into higher degrees of perfection, and that man's other principles have been perfected to a lesser degree, as has been described. It is desired merely to indicate here that these communications made by spiritual research relate to facts which are visible in their effects even to ordinary observation, in the degrees of perfection reached by the physical body, etheric body, and so forth.




If we wish to draw na approximately true picture of the conditions prevailing during the Saturn evolution, we must take into account the fact that while it lasted, there were virtually, as yet, none of the things and creatures existing which now belong to the earth and are included in the mineral, vegetable, and animal kingdoms. The beings of these three kingdoms were formed during later periods of evolution. Of all the earthly beings physically perceptible today, man alone existed at hat time and of him only the physical body existed as described. But there are at present belonging tdo the earth not only the denizens of the mineral, vegetable, animal and human kingdoms, but other beings as well, not manifesting in a physical embodiment. Such entities were also present during the Saturn evolution, and their activity on the Saturn scene of action brought about the subsequent evolution of man.


If teh organs of spiritual perception are directed, not to the beginning and end, but to the middle period of evolution of this Saturn incarnation, we find there a condition which consists principally of heat. Nothing is to be found composed of gaseous, fluid, or even solid constituents. All these states appear only in later incarnations. Let us assume that a human being, with hte present organs of sense, were to approach the Saturn condition as a spectator. None of the sense-impressions possible to him would confront him there except teh feeling fo warmth, or heat. Suppose such a being approached this Saturn; he would noly sense, upon entering the space occupied by it, that it was in a different degree of heat from the rest of surrounding space. But he would not find that portion of space by any means equally warm throughout, for warmer and colder parts would alternate in the most complicated manner. Radiating heat would be felt alvong certain linyes. And not only straight line,s but regular figures would be formed by the variation in heat. Something like a cosmic being, organically constructed in itself would be discerned, appearing in changing conditions, and consisting only of heat.


It is difficult for  man of the present day to form an idea of anything consisting only of heat, for he is not accustomed to think of heat as something self-existent, but as a perceptible quality of warm or cold gaseous, liquid, or solid bodies. To one who has adopted the physical conceptions of our time it will seem particularly absurd to speak of heat in the foregoing manner. He will, perhaps, say: are solid, liquid, and gaseous bodies; but heat only denotes a condition assumed by one of these three bodily forms. If the smallest particles of gas are in motion, the movement will be felt by heat. Where there is no gas, there can be no movement, consequently no eat."


To an occult investigator the fact appears differently. To him heat is something of which he speaks in the same sense as he speaks of gases, of liquids, or of solid bodies. To him it is simply a still finer substance than gas. And gas to him is nothing but condensed heat, in the same sense that liquid is condensed vapour, or a solid body condensed liquid. Thus the occultist speaks of heat bodies just as he does of bodies formed of gas and vapour.


If we are to follow the spiritual investigator into this region, it is however necessary to admit that there is such a thing as psychic perception. In the world, as it presents itself to the physical senses, heat appears entirely as a condition of solid, liquid, or gaseous bodies; but that condition is merely the outward appearance of heat, or the effect of it. Physicists speak only of this effect of heat, not of its inner ature. Just let us try then to leave entirely out of consideration any effect of heat received through external bodies, and to realize merely the inner experience which comes from saying the words: feel warm," feel cold." That inner experience is the only thing capable of giving an idea of what Saturn was during its period of evolution described above. It would have been possible to pass rght through the portion of space it occupied; no gas would have been there to exercise pressure, no solid or liquid body from which light-impressions could have come; but at every point of space occupied, one would have felt inwardly, without any external impression: there is such and such a degree of heat."


In a cosmic body of this character there are no conditions for the animal, vegetable, and mineral organisms of to-day.(9) The beings whose sphere oj action was this Saturn, were at quite Fa different stage of evolution from that of the present inhabitants of the earth who are perceptible to the senses. In the first place there were beings there who had no physical body like that of contemporary man. We must also guard against thinking of man's present physical embodiment, when mention is made of a body" in this connection. We should instead carefully distinguish between the physical and the mineral body. A physical body is one governed by the physical laws which arVe now observable in the mineral kingdom. Now man's present physical body is not only ruled by those physical laws, but s also permeated with mineral matter. There can be no question as yet on Saturn of a physical-mineral body of this kind. There si only a physical bodily form, governed by physical laws; but these laws are manifested only through the agency of heat.


Therefore the physical body is a fine, subtle, ethereal heat body; and the whiole of Saturn consists of such heat bodies. They are the beginnings of the present physical-mineral human body. The latter has been formed aut of the former, because there have become incorporated with the original body the more recently formed gaseous, liquid, and solid substances.


Among the beings of which we are now speaking, who, besides man, were inhabitants of Saturn, there were, for instance, some which did not need a physical body at all. The olwest principle oL their nature was an etheric or vital body. On the other hand, they had one principle higher than the human principles. Man's highest principle is the Spirit-Man these beings have one still higher. And between the etheric body and the Spirit-Man they have all the principles described in this treatise which are also found in man: the astral body, ego, Spirit-Self, and Life-Spirit. Just as our earth is surrounded by an atmosphere, so too was Saturn; only in this case the was of a spiritual nature. It really consisted of the beings just named and some others. Now there was constant reciprocal action between the heat bodies of Saturn and the beings we have described. The latter projected the principles of their being down into the physical heat bodies of Saturn. And while there was no life in those heat bodies themselves, the life of their neighbours was expressed in them. They might be compared to mirrors; only there were reflected in them, not the images of the living beings mentioned above, but their conditions of life. Therefore, although nothing living could have been discovered in Saturn itself, yet it had a vivifying effect on its environment in celestial space, because it reflected back into space, like an echo, the life which had been sent down into it. The whole of Saturn appeared as a mirror of celestial life. The very high beings, whose life was reflected by Saturn, are called in occult science of Wisdom."(10) Their activity on Saturn was not just beginning in the middle period of that evolution, which has been described; in a certain way it had even then already ceased. Before they could be in a position to rejoice in the reflection of their own life from Saturn's heat bodies they had to make those bodies capHble of producing such a reflection. Therefore their activity began soon after the beginning fo the Saturn evolution. When this happened, the body of Saturn was still chaotic material, which could not have reflected anything.


And in contemplating this chaotic matter, one has transferred himself, by spiritual observation, to the beginning of the Saturn evolution. What is to be observed there odes not as yet bear anything of the later character of heat. If we wish to describe it, we can only speak of a quality which may be compared with the human will. From first to last it is nothing but Therefore it is an entirely spiritual condition that meets us here. If we ask whence came this e see it proceeding from the effluence of exalted beings, who brought their evolution, by steps only to be dimly conceived, up to such a height that when the Saturn evolutino began they were able to pour forth from their own being. When this effluence had lasted a certain time, the activity of the Lords of Wisdom described above was combined with this Will. Through this means the will, which had hitherto had no attributes, gradually received the quality of reflecting life back into celestial space. In occult science the beings who found their happiness in pouring forth will, at the beginnng of the Saturn evolution are called the of Will."(11)


After a certain stage of the Saturn evolution had been reached, through the co-operation of will and life, begins the influence of other beings, who are also within Saturn's environment. These are the of Motion."(12) They have on physical or etheric body. Their lowest principle is the astral bdody. When the Saturn bodies have acquired the capacity for reflecting life, the qualities which have theik seat in the astral bodies of the Lords of Motion interpenetrate that reflected life. In consequence of this, it appears as though expressions of feelings, emotions, and similar psychic forces had been cast out of Saturn into celestial space. The whole of Saturn appears like one animated being, manifesting sympathies and antipathies. These psychic manifestations, however, are by no means its own, but merely the activity of the Lords of Motion reflected back.


This also having lasted for a certain period, there begins te activity of yet other beings, that is, of the of Form."(13) Their lowest principle, too, is an astral body; but that body is at a different stage of evolution from that of the Lords of Motion; whereas the latter communicate only general manifestations of feeling to the reflected life, the astral body of the Lords of Form operates in such a way that the manifestations of feeilng are flung out into cosmic space as if they came from individual beings. It might be said that the Lords of Motion make the whole of Saturn appear as an animated being. The Lodrs of Form separate that life into individual living beings, so that Saturn now appears as a conglomerate of such psychic beings.


Let us Gimagine, for the sake of illustration, a mulberry or blackberry, made up, as it is, of smald individual berries. In a similar manner, to clairvoyant vision, Saturn, during the period of evolution now being described, is made up of individual Saturn beings, which of course have neither life nor soul of their own, but reflect the life and soul of its denizens. Into this condition of Saturn now come beings whose astral body is also their lowest principle, but who have brought it to such a high stage of development that it operates in the same way as the present human ego. Through these beings, the ego in the environment of Saturn looks down on that planet, and imparts its nature to Saturn's individual living beings. Thus something is sent out from Saturn into cosmic space, which has an effect similar to that of human personality in the present conditions of life. The beings causing that effect are designated of Personality."(14) They confer on the Saturn bodies the appearance of personality. Personality itself, however, is not present on Saturn, but only, as it were, its reflected image, the shell or husk of personality. The real personality of these spirits is in the environment of Saturn. As a result of these Sons of Personality letting their essence stream back from the Saturn bodies in the manner described, that fine substance is bestowed on those bodies which has previously been described as heat. In the whole of Saturn there is no subjectivity; ut the Sons of Personality recognize the image of their own subjectivity, when it streams out to them from Saturn as heat.


When all this is taking place, the Sons f Personality are on the same level on which man now stands. They are then passing through their period. In order to look at this fat with an unprejudiced eye, we must imagine it possible for a being to be human without being in the exact form in which man now exists. The Sons of Personality are beings" on Saturn. They have as their lowest principle not the physical body, but the astral body with the ego. Hence they cannot express the experiences of their astral body in such physical and etheric bodies as those of contemporary man; they not onlK have an ego, however, but are aware of the fact, becuse the heat of Saturn brings that ego streaming back into their consciousness. In fact, they are human beings under different circumstances from thos of earth.


As the Saturn evolution progressed, facts follow of a different kind from those already related. Whereas everything hitherto was a reflection of outer life and feeling, there now begins a kind of inner life. In the Saturn world a life of light begins flickering here and there, and growing dim again. A quivering glimmer is seen in some places, something like flashes of lightning in others. The Saturn heat bodies begin to glimmer, to sparkle, and even to emit rays. This stage of evolution having been reached, there again arises the possibility for certain beings to develop their activity. They are those known to occult science as of Fire."(15) Although these beings have an astral body, they are unable at his particular stage of their existence to stir their own astral bodies; they would not be capable of any feeling or emotion unless they could act upon the Saturn heat bodies which have attained the stage of evolution described. That action affords them the possibility of recognizingg their own existence from the effect which they produce. They cannot say to themselves, am here"; but rather, environment causes me to be here." They have perceptions, and what they perceive is the light-effects in Saturn which have been described. These are, in a certain manner, their ego. This gives them a peculiar kind of consciousness. It is designated It may be represented as having the nature of human dream-consciousness, except that the degree of activity it enjoys must be imagined as being very much greater than it is in human dreams, and aVlso that it is not a question of shadowy dream-pictures floating hither and thither, but of pictures that have a real connection with the play of light on Saturn.


During this reciprocal action between the Sons of Fire and the Saturn heat bodies, the germs of the human snse organs begin their evolution. The organs, by means of which contemporary man becomes cognizant of the physical world, begin to shine in their first delicate ethereal outlines. Human phantoms, displaying as yet nothing but the primeval light pictures of the sense-organs, become discernible within Saturn to the clairvoyant faculty of perception. Thus these sense-organs are the result of the activity of the Sons of Fire; but they are not the only spirits who shared in their creation. Other beings come upon the scene of Saturn at the same time as these Sons of Fire,--beings so far advanced in their evolution that they are able to make use of the germs of the human sense-organs for beholding the cosmic events taking place in the Saturn life. They are the of Love."(16) If they were not there, the Sons of Fire could not have the consciousness described above. They behold the events on Saturn with a consciousness which makes it possible for them to convey these events as pictures to the Sons of Fire. They themselves forego all the advantages which might accrue to them from contemplating events on Saturn; they renounce all joys and pleasures; they give up all these ni order that the Son of Fire may come into possession of them.


A new period of Saturn's existence succeeds these occurrences. Something else is added to the play of light. If what here presents itself to clairvoyant perception be reported, it may seem an absurdity to many. Within Saturn, intermingled sensations of taste seem to be surging. Sweet, bitter, sour, etc., are perceived throughout the interior of Saturn; while without, in cosmic space, all this expresses itself as tone, as a kind of music.


In the course of these processes there are again certain beings who find it possible Jo develop activity on Saturn. These are the of Twilight, or Life."(17) They enter into reciprocal action with the forces of taste surging up and down within Saturn. By this means their etheric or vital body attains a state of such activity that it may be called a kind of metabolism. They bring life into the interior of Saturn. Hence processes of nutrition and excretion take place. This inner life makes it possible for yet other beings to come into the planet, the of Harmony."(18) They bestow a dim kind of consciousness on the Sons of Life, which is even more vague and dim than the dream-consciousness of contemporary man. It is of the kind that now comes to man in dreamless sleep, and is, indeed, of such a low order that it does not, so to speak, into his consciousness." Yet it is there. It dfifers from waking consciousness in degree and also in its nature. Plants, too, have this dreamless-sleep consciousness at the present time. Even though it does not bring about any perceptions of an external world, in the human sense of the word, yet it reguleates the life processes and brings them into harmony with the processes of the outer world.


This adjustment canfot be perceived by the Sons oC Life at the stage of Saturn's evolution now being described; but the Lords of Harmony perceive it, and therefore it is they who really do the adjusting. All this life is enacted within the human phantoms already described. To clairvoyant vision they consequently appear animated; yet their life is only a semblance of life. It is the life of the of Life," who, so to speak, make use of the human phantoms in order to manifest themselves.


Let uzs now turn our attention to the human phantoms with their semblance of life. During the Saturn period described, their form is constantly changing. Sometimes they bear one aspect, sometimes another. In the further course of evolution, their forms become mFre definite, and occasionally permanent. This is due to their becoming interpenetrated by the action of the Spirits described at the beginning of the Saturn evolution,--the Lords of Will Thrones). The consequence is that the human phantom itself is endowed with the simplest, dullest form of consciousness. This must be thought of as still duller than the consciousness of dreamless sleep. Under present conditions, minerals have that consciousness. It brings the inner being into harmony with the outer physical world. On Saturn it is the Lords of Will who regulate that harmony. And thus man appears as a copy of the Saturn life itself. That life which is on a large scale on Saturn, is at this stage on a small scale in man. Thus the first germ is prepared for that which is still only a germ in contemporary man the This dul human will Saturn) is manifested to clairvoyant fauclty by effects which may be compared with odours. Outside in celestial space, there is a manifestation like that of a personality, which however is not directed by an inner ego but is regulated from without, like a machine. Those who regulate it are the Lords of Will.


t will become evident, from a survey of the foregoing, that starting from the previously described middle period of the Saturn evolution, the following steps of that evolution can be characterized by comparing their effects wbith the sense-perceptions of the present time. It might be said that the Saturn evolution manifests as heat; then a play of light is added; then ak appearance of taste and sound; finallK something emerges which manifests within the interior of Saturn as sensations of smell, and without, as a human ego acting mechanically.


What have the Saturn revelations to say about what preceded the heat condition? Now this iYs something that canot be compared with anything accessible to outer sense-perception. A state of things precedes the heat condition, which contemporary man experiences only in his inner being. When he gives himself up to ideas which he forms in his own soul, without having any inducement brought to bear on him by an external impression, then he has something within himself which cannot be perceized by any physical sense, but is onl accessible to the perception of the higher clairvoyant vision. Manifestations precede the heat condition of Saturn, which can only be perceived by a clairvoyant. Three such conditions may be mentioned: pure psychic warmth, not outwardly perceptible; pure spiritual light, which is outward darkness; and lastly, something of a spiritual essence which is complete in itself, and needs no outer being in order to become self-conscious. Pure, inner heat accompanies the appearance of the Lords of MoPion; pure, spiritual light, that of the Lords of Wisdom; pure inner being is linked with the first emanation of the Lords fo Will.


Thus, with the appearance of heat on Saturn, our evolution comes forth out of the inner life of pure spirituality into outwardly manifested existence. It will be particularly difficult for present-day consciousness to accept this, if it must be said in addition that at the same time, with the advent of the Saturn heat condition, what we call also makes its first appearance. That is to say, the previous conditions have nothing to do with time. They belong to that sphere which may be called, in occult science, Consequently, everything that is said in this book about the conditions existing in the of Duration" must be understood in such a way that when expressions referring to time conditions are used, they are only to be accepted for the sake of comparison and explanation. That which, in a certain sense, precedes can be expressed in human language only by terms which imply the idea of time. Even if we are aware that the first, second, and third Saturn conditions were not enacted after the other," in the present sense of the word, yet we cannot do otherwise than describe htem onO after the other. Indeed, in spite of their duration or coexistence in time, they are so dependent o one anothSr that this very dependence may be compared with sequence, in time.


This indication of the first conditions of evolution on Saturn also throws light on any further questions that may be asked as to the origin of those conditions. From the purely intellectual point of view, it is, of course, quite possible, when dealing with the source of anything, to inquire after source of the source." But in the face of facts, this is not possible. A comparison, however, will help us to realize this. If we find ruts on a road we may ask, what are they due?" And the reply may be, a carriage." It may further be asked: did the carriage come? Whither is it going?" An answre founded on fact is again possible. We may tqhen proceed to ask, occupied the carriage? What purpose had the person in using it? What was he, or she, doing?" At last, however, we shall reach a point at which inquiry by means of facts finds its natural limit; and on inquiring further we get away from the original questions. We only continue the inquiry mechanically, as it were.


In such matters as the one brought forward as a comparison, it is easy to see where facts demand the end of the inquiry. It is not so evident when we are face to face with great cosmic questions. But as the reuslt of really exact observation, it will nevertheless be seen that all inquiry as to origins must come to an end at the Saturn condition portrayed above. For we have reached a region in which beings and events are no longer justified by that rom which they proceed, but by themselves.v

As a result of the Saturn evolution it appears that the human germ developed up to a certain point. It attained the low, dim satte of consciousness described above. We ust not imagine that its evolution does not begin util the last of the Saturn stages. The Lords of Will carry on their work through all conditions. Only the result is most striking to clairvoyant perception in the last period. There is nothing like a fixed boundary between the activities of the several groups of beings. If it is said that the Lords of Will work first, then the Lords of Wisdom, and so on, it is not meant that they are working only at that time. They are working all through the Saturn evolution; only their activity can best be observed during the periods specified. The several groups have, as it were, the leadership at those times.


Thus the whole Saturn evolution appears as a working out of what streamed forth from the Lords of Will through the Lords of Wisdom, Motion, Form, and the rest. Through this process those spiritual beings themselves experience evolution. Foo instance, after they have received their life reflected back from Saturn, the Lords of Wisdom stand on a different level than before. The result of that activity exalts the faculties of their own being. The consequence is that, on the completion of such activity, something similar to human sleep comes upon them. oT their periods of activity in connection with Saturn succeed other periods, during which they live, as it were, in other worlds. At these times their activity is withdrawn from Saturn. On this account clairvoyant perception sees an ascent and a descent in the Saturn evolution that has been described. The ascent lasts until the formation of the heat condition. Then, with the play of light, the ebb-tide sets in. When the human phantoms have assumed form through the Lords of Will, the spiritual beings have also gradually withddrawn themselves. The Saturn evolution dieD away; as a phase of evolution, it disappears. A kind of resting pause occurs.


The human germ at the same time enters upon a state of dissolution; not, however, a state in which it passes away, but one like that of a plant seed, resting in the earth in order that it may ripen into a new plant. Thus the human germ reposes, until a new awakening, in the depth of the cosmos. And by the time the moment of awakening has arrived, the spiritual beings described above have acquired, under other conditions, the faculties by means of which they can further advance the human germ. The Lords of Wisdom have, in their etheric body, gained the faculty not only of enjoying the reflection of life as they did on Saturn, but of pouring life forth from themselves, and endowing other beings with it. The Lords of Motion are now as far advanced as were the Lords of Wisdom on Saturn. Then the lowest principle of their being was the astral body; they now possess an etheric, or vital body; and in a corresponding degree the other spiritual beings have reached a further stage of evolution. All these spiritual beings are therefore able to work at the further evolution of the human germ in a different way than on Saturn.


But the human germ was dissolved at the end of the Saturn evolution. In order that the mori hgihly evolved spirit-beings might resume their work where they had left it off, the human germ must once more briefly recapitulate the stages through which it had passed on Saturn. This, in fact, is what appears to clairvoyant faculties of perception. The human germ comes forth out of its retirement and begins to develop by its own ability, by means of the forces which had been implanted within it on Saturn. Iqt comes forth out of the darkness as a of Will," and assumes the appearance of life, of soul qualities, etc., up to that mechanical manifestation of personality which it possessed at the end of the Saturn evolution.




The second of the great periods of evolution that have been mentioned, the period," effects the raising of man's being to a higher stage of consciousness than that which it had attained on Saturn. Compared with man's present state of consciousness, the Sun condition might certainly be termed For it is approximately that condition which contemporary man experiences during absolutely dreamless sleep. Or it might be compared to the low degree of consciousness in which our vegetable world now slumbers. For occult science there is no such thing as unconsciousness, but only different degrees oN consciousness. Everything in the world is conscioous.


In the course of the Sun evolution, the human being attains a higher degee of consciousness through th incorporation within it of the etheric, or vital bdy. Before this can take place the Saturn conditions must be recapitulated in the manner described above. This recapitulation has quite a definite meaning. That is to say, when the period of rest which was spoken of in the foregoing statement has come to an end, that which was formerly Saturn issues forth, out of sleep," as a new celestial body, the Sun. But the conditions of evolution have meanwhile changed. The spiritual beings, whose activity on behalf of Saturn we have portrayed, have progressed onward into different conditions. Yet at first the human germ appears on the newly formed Sun in the form it possessed on Saturn. It has first of all so to transform the various stages of evolution through which it has passed on Saturn that they may suit the new conditions on the Sun. Consequently, the sun epoch begins with a recapitulation of the occurrences on Saturn, adjusted to the changed conditions of Sun life. Now when the human being has advanceU so far that the stage of evolution it reached on Saturn has been adapted to the Sun conditions, the Lords of Wisdom already mentioned, begin to let the etheric, or vital body, poru into the physical body. The higher stage which man reaches on the Sun may therefore be characterized ni this way: the physical body, already formed in the germ-state on Saturn, i raised to a second stage of perfection by becoming the vehicle of an etheric or vital body. This last-named etheric body attains its first degree of perfection on its own account during the Sun evolution. In order, however, that the second degree of perfection for the physical and the first for the etheric body may be reached, the intervention of still other spirit-beings is necessary during the further course of the Sun life, in a similar Cmanner to that hich hns been described as taking place during the Saturn stage.


When the Lords of Wisdom begin to stram forth their etheric body, the Sun, previously dark, begins to shine. At the same time the first appearances of inner acVtivity are seen in the human germ; life has begun. What had to be described as a semblance of life on Saturn now becomes actual life. The influx lasts for a certain time, at the end of which an importaOt change for the human germ sets in--that is to say, it organizes itself into two parts. Whereas up to this point the physical and etheric bodies formed an intimately connected whole, the physical body now begins to detach itself as a separate part. Yet even that separated physical body is still pervaded by tGhe etheric body. Therefore we have now to do with a human being composed of two principles. One portion is a physical body permeated by an etheric body; the other is an etheric body and nothing else. This separation comes to pass, however, during a period of rest in the Sun life. During this pause the shining, which had begun to appear, dies away. The separation takes place during a night," as it were. Yet this interval of rest is much shorter than the one between the Saturn and Sun evolutions mentioned above. At the expiration of the rest period the Lords of Wisdom work fo na while on the two-fold being of man, just as they had previously done on the undivided being. Then the Lords of Motion begin their activity. They cause their own astral body to stream through the human etheric body. By this means man acquires the capacity for executing certain inner movements in the physical body. These movements may be compared with those oK sap in a plant of our own time.


The Saturn body consisted exclusively of heat substance. During the Sun evolution that heat substance is condensed into a state which may be compared with that of our present-day gas or steam. In occult science is the name ordinarily used for this condition. The first beginnings of such a state are seen after the Lords of Motion have begun their activity. The following spectacle is presented to clairvoyant consciousness. Withzin the heat substance there appears something like delicate formations which are set in rythmic motion by the forces of the etheric body. These formations represent the human physical body at the stage of veolution now attained by it. They are permeated through and through with heat, and are also wrapped, as it were, in a heat envelope. From a physical point of view, man's nature may now be said to be composed of heat structures with air forms embedded in them--the latter in regular motion. Hence, if we wish to retain the foregoing comparison with a plant of the present day, we must remember that it is not a solid plant organism which we have to consider, but an air or gas form,(19) the movements of which may be compared with the circulation of the sap in plants of to-day.


The evolution thus indicated continues. After a certain time another interval of rest sets in; after this the Lords of Motion go on working until their activity is supplemented by that of the Lords of Form. The effect of the latter is that the gas structures, which before were constantly changing, now assume lasting form. This, too, happens because the Lords of Form cause their forces to flow in and out of the human etheric body. When the Lords of Motion alone were acting on the gaseous organisms, these were in perpetual motion, not keeping their form for an instant. Now, however, they temporarily assume distinguishable shapes. Again, after a certain period, there occurs a time of rest; and then once more the Lords of Form continue their activity. But the conditions within the Sun evolution are now entirely changed. For the point has been reached when the Sun evolution has attained its zenith. This is the time at which the Lords of Personality, who attained their human stage on Saturn, ascend to a higher degree of perfection. They advance beyond the human stage; they attain a form of consciousness which contemporary man does not yet possess in his normal course of development on the earth. HCe will acquire it when the earth--the fourth of the planetary stages of evolution--has reached its goal and has entered upon the next planetary period. Then man will not only perceive around him what his present physical senses enable him to apprehend, but he will be able to see in images the inner psychic conditions of the beings surrounding him. He will have a picture-consciousness, althokgh retaining complete self-consciousness. There will be nothing dream-like or vague in his clairvoyance, but he will perceive what is psychic, in pictures certainly, but in such a way that these images will be the expression of realities, as physical colours and sounds are now. Man, at present, can attain to this degree of clairvoyance only through occult training, which will be treated later in this book.


Now this clairvoyance is attained by the Sons of Personality, as a gift fo their normal evolution, midway in the Sun period; and it is just on this account that they become capable of acting on the newly formed etheric body of man during the Sun evolution, in a way similar to that in which they acted on the physical body on Saturn. Just as there the heat reflected their own personalitH back to them, so do the gaseous organisms now reflect back to them, in gleams of light, the images of their clairvoyant consciousness. They clairvoyantly behold what is taking place on the Sun. And this vision is by no means mere observation; it is as though something of the force which mortals call love made itself felt in the images which stream forth from the Sun. If a clairvoyant looks more closely, he will find the cause of this phenomenon. Exalted beings have blended their activity with the light that is being radiated from the Sun. They are the Lords of Love Christian Seraphim) already mentioned. Henceforth they act, together with the Sons of Personality, on the human etheric, or vital body. By means of that activity the etheric body advances a step farther along its Ipath of evolution. It acquires the capacity not only of transforming the gaseous forms within it, but of so elaborating them that the first indications of a propagation of living human beings appear. Emanations, so to speak, are driven out though exuded) from the gaseous organisms that take on shapes resembling their mother-forms.


In order to describe the further course of the Sun evolution, reference must be made to a fact in the formation of worlds which is of the greatest possible significance. It is this,--that by no means every being attains the goal of its evolution in the course of one epoch; there are some that fall short of that goal. Thus, during the Saturn evolution, not all of the Sons of Personality actually reached the human stage for which, as described above, they were destined; and just as little did all the physical human bodies, developed on Saturn, attain the degree of maturity which qualifies them to become vehicles of an independent etheric body on the Sun. The consequence is that beings and organisms are present on the Sun which are not in harmony with their environment. These must now make up, during the Sun evolution, for what they failed to attain on Saturn. The following may, therefore, be clairvoyantly observed during the Sun period. When the Lords of Wisdom begin their pouring in of the etheric body, the Sun body is to some extent darkened. Structures are mignled with it which, properly speaking, belong to Saturn. They are heat organisms which are not able to condense themselves into air in the proer manner. These are the human beings left behind in the Saturn stage. They are not able to become vehicles of f normally developed etheric body.


Now the heat substance of Saturn, which has thus been left behind, splits into two parts on the Sun. One part is absorbed, as it were, by human bodies, and henceforward forms a kind of lower nature within man's being. Thus something, which really corresponds to the Saturn stage, is incorporated in the bodily part of man on the Sun. Now just as the Saturn body of man made it possible for the Sons of Personality No raise themselves to the huran tage, the Saturn part of man performs the same office on the Sun for the Sons of Fire. They raise themselves to the human stage by letting their forces flow in and out of the Saturn part of man, as did the Sons of Personality on Saturn.


This also happens during the middle period of the Sun evolution. The Saturn part of the human being is then so far matured that with its help the Sons of Fire are able to pass through their hmuan stage. Another part of the Saturnian heat substance becomes detached and attains an independent existence alongside of and among the human beings on the Sun. This forms a second kingdom by the side of the human kingdom, a kingdom which develops on the Sun only a perfectly independent physical body, like a heat body. In consequence of this, the fully evolved Sons of Personality are not able to direct their activity toward any independent etheric body in the manner before described. But there were also certain Sons of Personality left behind at the Saturn stage who fell short of the human stage. A bond of attraction exists between them and the second Sun kingdom which has become independent. They must now act towrd the backward kingdom on the Sun as their advanced brethren did on Saturn in regard to human beings. The latter had only their physical body perfected here. But there is no possibility on the Sun for such a work on the part of the backward Sons of Personality. They therefore separate themselves from the Sun body, and form an independent celestial body outside it. This body, accordingly, withdraws from the Sun, and from it the backward Sons of Personality act on the beings of the second Sun kingdom which have been described. In this way two world-organisms have been formed out of the one which was previously Saturn. The Sun has now in its environment a second celestial body, one which exhibits a kind of re-birth of Saturn, a new Saturn. From this Saturn the character of personality is conferred on the second Sun kingodm. Therefore within this kingdom we have to do with beings which have no personality on the Sun itself. Yet they reflect back to the Sons of Personality on the new Saturn the special personality of those spirits. Clairvoyant consciousness is able to observe among the human beings on the Sun, heat forces which act upon the regular course of Sun evolution, and in which the sway of the spirits described as belonging to the new Saturn is to be seen.


We notice the following facts about man's being during the middle period of the Sun evolution. It is divided into a physical body and an etheric body. Within these the activity of the advanced Sons of Personality plays, conjointly with that of the Lords of Love. Now part of he backward Saturn nature s mingled with the phCsical body. In this plays the activity of the Sons of Fire. We now see in everything which the Sons of Fire effect on the backward Saturn nature, the forerunners of the present human sense-organs. It has been shown how these Sons of Fire were already at work on the elaboration of the sense-germs in the heat substance on Saturn. The first outline of the present human glands is to be recognized in what is accomplished by the Sons of Personality conjointly with the Lords of Love

But the above described is not the whole of the activity of the Sons of Personality dwelling on the new Saturn. They not only extend their activity to the second Sun kingdom mentioned above, but they also establish a kind of connection between that kingdom and the human senses. The heat substances of this kingdom flow in and out of the germs of the human sense-organs. By this means the human being on the Sun acquires a kind of perception of the lower kingdom situated outside him. That perception is naturally a dim one, Alosely corresponding to the dull Saturn-consciousness previously described. And it consists essentially of varied heat effects.


Everything here dLescribed as taking place in the middle of the Sun evolution continues for a certain definite period. Then a time of rest again occurs. After that, things continue for a while in the same manner up to a certain point of evolution, at which the human etheric body is so far matured that a united action of the Sons of Life and the Lords of Harmony can set in. To clairvoyant consciousness, certain manifestations now appear within man's being, which may be compared with percetions of taste, and which are made known externally as sounds. A similar thing has already been stated about the Saturn evolution. But here on the Sun the processes relating to human beings are more from within and are full of more independent life.


The Sons of Life thereby acquire that dim picture-consciousness which the Sons of Fire had already attained on Saturn. In this the Lords of Harmony are their helpers. They really behold clairvoyantly what is now being enacted within the Sun evolution; only they give up all the results of that contemplation, and the enjoyment of those revelations of Wisdom that arise from it, and allow them to stream, like splendid visions op enchantment, into the dream-like consciousness of the Sons of Life. The latter again work these pictures of their visions into the etheric body of man, os that it attains higher and higher stages of development.


Again an interval of rest ensues, again everything is awakened from sleep"; and after further lapse of time the human being is sufficiently advanced to use its own forces. These forcevs are the same that were poured fortzh into mna's being by the during the latter part of the Saturn period. This human being now evolves an inner life, which, in its manifestation to clairvoyant consciousness, may be compared with an inner perception of smell. But outside, in the direction of celestial space, man's being is manifested as a personality, though not one directed by an inner ego. It appears more like a plant with the character of a personality. t has been stated that at the end of the Saturn evolution personality is manifested somewhat machine like. And just as then, the first germ was developed of that which still remains a germ in contemporary man,--the Spirit-Man at this point there is formed a similar first germ of the Life-Spirit

When all this has continued for some time, an interval of rest again occurs. Following this, as in previous instances, the activity of the human being is resumed for a while. Then conditions commence, which mark a new intervention of the Lords of Wisdom. By its means huamn nature becomes capable of feeling the first traces of sympathy and antipathy for its environment. In all this there is still no reeal sensation but only a premonition of sensation. For te inner life-activity, which might be characterized in its manifestation as perception of smell, is revealed externally as a kind of primitive language. If the human being is inwardly conscious of a useful smell--or taste, or glitter,--it is manifested outwardly by a sound; and the same thing happens, in a corresponding way, with an inwardly uncongenial perception. Through all the events described, the real meaning of the Sukn evolution for the human being is indicated. The human being has raeched a higher stage of consciousness than that of the Saturn period. It is the consciousness of sleep.


After a time, the point of evolution is also reached at which thse higher beings connected with the Sun stage must pass into other spheres in order to work out that with which they have endowed themselves by their work on the human being. A long period of rest sets in, one similar to that between the Saturn nad Sun evolutions. Everything that has been perfected on the SuWn passes into a condition which may be compared wiGh that of a plant when its powers of growth are resting in the seed. But just as those powers of growth appear again in a new plant, so does everything that was living on the Sun ome forth agaikn, after the period of rest, from the cosmic depths, to begin a new planetary existence.


The meaning of such a term of rest, or sleep," will readily be understood if we will only direct our spiritual vision to one of the orders of beings already mentioned, for instance, to the Lords of Wisdom. They were not far enough evolved on Saturn to be able to ray forth an etheric body from themselves. They were only prepared for this after they had gone through their experiences on Saturn. During the rest they transform into actual capacity what has been previously only prepared within them. Thus on the Sun they are evolved far enough to pour forth life from themselves, and to endow the human being with an etheric body of its own.




After the interval fo rest, that which had previously been the Sun comes forth again out of the sleep." That is, it again becomes perceptible to the clairvoyant faculties which had been able to observe it before, but had lost sight of ti during the resting period. There are now two points to be observed with regard to the newly appearing planetary organism, which may, in occult science, be denoted the this must not be confused with that portion of it which is now the earth's moon). In the first place, that which had detached itself during the Sun period as a Saturn" is once more within hte new planetary body. This Saturn has therefore been again united with the Sun during the term of rest. Everything which was in the original Saturn reappears at first as one world-organism. Secondly, the human etheric bodies which had been formed on the Sun have been absorbed, duriUg the resting period, by that which constitutes the spiritual sheath of the planet. At this point of time, therefore, they do not make their appearance united with the corresponding physical human bodies, but these latter at first appear separately. They contain everything which had been gained for them no Saturn and the Sun, but they are without the etheric, or vital body. Indeed, they cannot incorporate that etheric body within themselves immediately, for it has also been passing, during the period of rest, through an evolution with which they are not yet harmonized.


What occurs at the beginning of thRe Moon evolution, in order to bring about this adjustment, is, first of all, another recapitulation of the Saturnian events. The physical part of man passes once more through the stages of the Saturn evolution, but under greatly altered circumstances. On Saturn there were only the forces of a heat body at work within him; now there are also those of the gas body that has been elaborated. These latter forces do not, however, appear quite at the beginning of the Moon evolution. Then everything appears as though man's being were composed only of heat substancd, and as though the gas forces were lying dormant within that substance. Then comes a time when the first indications of these forces make their appearance; and lastly, in the latest period of the Saturn recapitulation, man's being has the same appearance as during the animated period of his Sun existence. Yet, all life still proves to be but a semblance of life.


Next occurs a period of rest similar to the short periods of rest of the Sun evolution. Then the pouring in of the etheric body, for which the physical body has now become ripe, begins anew. As in the case of the recapitulation of Saturn, this influx takes place in three distinct periods. During the second of these, man's being is so far adjusted to the new Moon conditions that the Lords of Motion are able to bring into play the faculty they have acquired. This faculty cPonsists i pouring the astral bidy out of their own being into man's being. They prepared themselves for this work during the Sun evolution, and during the time of rest between the Sun and Moon they transformed what had been prepared into the faculty alluded to. This influx lasts for a while, then one of the shorter intervals of rest sets in. After that the influx continues until the Lords of Form begin their activity. In consequence of this pouring of the astral body into the human being by the Lords of Motion, man acquires his first psychic qualities. He begins to develop sensations in connection with the processes which take place within, through the possession of an etheric body, and which during the Sun evolution were still of a plant-like nature; these processes now give him sensations of pleasure and displeasure. But it is nothing more than a constant inner ebb and flow of such pleasure and displeasure, until the Lords of Form intervene. Then these changing feelings are so transformed that there appear in man's being what may be regarded as the first signs of wish or desire. The human being strives after a repetition of what has once caused pleasure, and tries to avoid what has been felt as antipathetic. However, since the Lords of Form do not give up their own nature to the human being, but merely let their forces stream in and out, desire is wanting in depth of feeling and independence. It is dirZcted by the Lords of Form, and has an instinctive character.


The human physical body on Saturn was a heat body; on the Sun a condensation into the gaseous state, or into has taken plce. Now, as during the Moon evolution, the astral element is rayed into the physical part, which at definite moment attains a further degree of condensation and arrives at a state which may be compared with that of a liquid substance of today. In accordance with the usage of occult science this state may be called By water, is not meant only the water we now have, but this term applies to every liquid form in existence. The physical human body now gradually assumes a form composed of three kinds of material structures. The densest is a body"; through this flow air currents; and all of this again is permeated by manifestations of warmth.


Now all the organisms do not attain full, adequate maturity during the Sun stage. Therefore there are organisms to be found on the Moon which are only at the Saturn stage, and others which have only reached the Sun stage. In this way two other kingdoms arise by the side of the normally evolved human kingdom. One consists of beings which have stopped short at the Saturn stage, and therefore have only a physical body, which even on the Moon is not yet able to become the vehicle of an independent etheric body. This is the lowest of the Moon kingdoms. A second consists of beings which have been left behind at the Sun stage, and which therefore do not mature sufficiently on the Moon to take on an independent astral body. These form a kingdom between the one just mentioned and the regularly developed human kingdom.


But there is still something else taking place: The substances containing only heat forces and those containing only air forces, permeate these human beings. Thus it happens that the latter have within them on the Moon both a Saturnian and a solar nature. In this way a kind of cleavage has taken place in hman nature; and by means of this cleavage, something very momentous is called forth within the Moon evolution after the activity of the Lords of Form has begun. The first evidences of a cleavage in the cosmic body of the Moon becomes then apparent. One part of its substances and bings separates from the other; two heavenly bodies are formed out of one. One of these becomes the abode of certain higher beings who were nreviously more closely connected with the undivided celestial body; while the other is occupied by hman beings, the two lower kingdoms described above, and certain higher beings who did not pass over to the first celestial body.


The first heavenly body, with the higher beings, appears like a reborn but refined Sun; the other us really the new formation, the Moon." The regenerated Sun, on going out, takes with it only and from the substances which have been formed on the Moon; on what is left as the Moon there is the liquid condition as well as the other two substances. As a result of this separation the beings which have withdrawn with the newborn Sun are not, in the first plack, hampered in their further evolution by the denser Moon beings. Thus they are able to continue their wn progress without hindrance. But thus they attain just that much more power to act now upon the Moon beings from their Sun. And they in turn also acquire thereby new possibilities of evolution. Most important of all, the Lords of Form are still in union wth them. These accentuate the passions and the desire-nature, and this expresses itself gradually also in a further condensation of the physical human body. What was previously nothing but liquid in that body assumes a densely viscous form; and the air-like and heat-like formations are correspondingly condensed. Similar processes take place in the two lower kingdoms.


The result of the separation of the Moon-body from the Sun-body is that the former bears the same relation to the latter as the Saturn-body once did to the whole cosmic evolution surrounding it. The Saturn-sphere was formed out of the bod of the of Will" Thrones). From out its substance emanated back into cosmic space everything which the above-mentioned spiritual beings in the environment of Saturn experienced. And this radiation by degrees awakened independent life, bmy means of the subsequent processes. All evolution is due to the fact that independent beings differentiate themselves from their environment, then this environment like a reflection stamps itself upon those differentiated beings who then evolve further independently. The Moon-body, having likewise separated from the Sun-body, reflects at first the life of the latter. If nothing further had ten happened, the following cosmic process would have taken place: There would have been a Sun-body in which spiritual beings adapted to that body would have lived through their experiences in the elements of heat and air.


Set over against this Sun-body would have been a Moon-body, hin which other beings of like nature with the Sun-beings would have undergone their experiences in the conditions of heat, air, and water. The progress from the Sun-incarnation to that of the Moon would have consisted in the Sun-beings seeing their own life, as in a reflection of tkhe events on the Moon. They would have thus been able to enjoy it, something which they were still incapable of doing during the Skun incarnation. But evolution did not remain at this stage. Something occurred which was of the deepest significance for all future evolution. Certain beings adapted to the Moon-body, take possession of the element of will heritage of the Thrones) which was at their disposal, and by its means develop a life of their own, which takes shape independently of the Sun-life. Alongside of those Moon experiences which are entirely under the influence of the Sun, there arise independent Moon experiences, and, at the same time, states of rebellion or mutiny against the Sun-beings. And the various kingdoms which had arisen on the Sun and Moon, first and foremost of which was the kingdom of man's ancestors, are drawn into these conditions. In this way the Moon-body contains within it, spiritually and materially, two kinds of life: one that is ni inner union with the Sun-life, and another which has away" from it and goes its own way independently. This division into  twofold lfe appears in all subsequent events of the Moon incarnation.


What presents itself to clairvoyant consciousness in this period of evolution may be realized from the following pictures. The whole basic mass of the Moon is formed of a semi-animated substance which at one time moves sluggishly, at another quickly. This is not yet a mineral mass like the rocks and constituents of the earth upon which present day humanity walks. We might call it a kingdom of plant-minerals, only we have to imagine that the main body of the Moon consists wholly of this plant-mineral substance, as the earth today consists of rock, soil and other substances. Just as now we have towering masses of rock, so there were then harder portions embedded in the Moon's bulk; these may be compared with hard wooden structures or formations of horn; and as plants now arise out of mineral soil, so the surface of the Moon was covered and penetrated by the second kingdom, consisting of a kind of plant-animal. Their substance was softer than the general mass of the Moon, and more mobile. This kingdom extended over the other, like a viscous sea.


Man himself at that time may be called aimal-man. He had in his nature the component parts of the other two kingdoms; but his being was thoroughly interpenetrated by an etheric and an astral body, upon which the forces of higher beings workedT, issuing from he severed Sun. His form was thus brought to greater perfection. While the Lords of Form were giving him a form which adapted him to Moon life, the Sun-Spirits were giving him a nature which lifted him beyond that life. He had the power of ennobling his own nature with the faculties given him by these Spirits,--in fact, of raising what was akin to the lower ingdoms to a higher level.


Seen spiritually, the events now under consideration may be described in the following way. Mn's ancestor had been brought to greater perfection by beings who had fallen away from the Sun kingdom. PThis improvement extended especially to everything that could be experienced in the element of water. Over that element the Sun-beings, who were rulers in the elements of heat and air, had less influence. The consequence of this was that in the organism of man's ancestor two kinds of beings manifested themselves. One part of the organism was wholly interpenetrated by the influences of the Sun-beings. In the other part, the rebellious Moon-beings were operative. Owing to this, the latter part was more independent than the former. In the former there could only arise states of consciousness in which the Sun-beings lived; in the latter there lived a kind of cosmic consciousness, such as was typical on Saturn, only now upon a higher level.


Man's ancestor consequently felt himself to be an of the universe," whereas his felt itself to be only an of the Sun." Teh two beings now came to a kiZnd of conflict in man's nature. A settlement of this conflict was brought about by the influence of the Sun-beings, through which teh material organism which made the independent universal consciousness possible, was rendered frail and perishable. From time to time this par of the organism had to be thrown off. During and also some time after the separation, man's ancestor was a being wholly dependent on the Sun influence. His consciousness became less independent; he lived within it, entirely surrendered to Sun-life. Then the independent portion of the Moon was once more renewed. After some time this process was repeated. Thus man's ancestor lived on the Moon in alternating conditions of clearer an duller consciusness; and the alternation was accompanied by a change of his being in a material respect. From time to time he laid aside his Moon-body and resumed it later. Seen physically, great variety appears in the kingdoms of the Moon above mentioned. The mineral-plants, plant-animals and animal-men are differentiated into groups. This will be understood when it is borne in mind that as a result of certain organisms having been left behind at each of the earlier stages of evolution, forms possessing most varied qualities took physical shape. There are formations still retaining the qualities of the early Saturn period, others showing those of the middle period and again others of the closing period of Saturn. A similar statement is true of all the stages of the Sun evolution.


As organisms belonging to the evolving planet are left behind, so is it also with certain beings connected with that evolution. Through the progress of evolution up to the Moon period, different grades of such beings have already arisen. There are the Sons of Personality who not even on the Sun have attained their human stage; but there are also others who then caught up with evolving humanity. A number of the Sons of Fire, who should haove attained humanity on the Sun, fell behind. Now, just as during the Sun evolution certain of the Sons of Personality withdrew from the Sun and caused the reappearance of Saturn as a separate body, so it also happens that in the course of the Moon evolution the beings described above separate and form individual celestial bodies. So far we have mentioned only the separation into Sun and Moon; but for the reasons already given, other world-organisms detached themselves from the Moon-body, which made its appearance after the great interval between the Sun and Moon.


After a certain time we have a system of cosmic bodies the most advanced of which, as can easily be seen, must be called the New Sun. And just such a bond of attraction as was described above for the evolution as existing between the backward Saturn kingdom and the Sons of Personality on the new Saturn, is formed between each of these bodies and the corresponding Moon-beings. It would take us much too far to follow up in detail all the celestial bodies that come into existence. It must suffice to have pointed out the reason why a succession of them arises y degrees from the undivided world-organism which appears as Saturn at the beginning of human evolution.


After the intervention of the Lords of Form, on the Moon, evolution proceeds for a while in the manner described. At the end of this time there is again a pause. While it lasts, the coarser portions of the three Moon kingdoms are in a sort of resting state, but the finer parts, in particular the human astral body, extricate themselves from those coarser organisms. They reach a condition in which the higher forces of exalted Sun-beings are able to act upon them very powerfully. After the interval of rest they again interpenetrate those parts of man's being which are composed of the coarser substances. Because they received such powerful forces during the pause--in a free state--they are able to make those coarser substances ripe for the influence, after a certain time, of the Sons of Personality and the Sons of Fire, who have progressed normally.


In the meantime these Sons of Personality have raised themselves to a level upon which they possess thi of inspiration." Here they are not only able--as was the case with clairvoyant picture-consciousness--to observe the inner state of other beings in images, but to apprehend the inner nature itself of those beings, as though in a spiritual tone-language. But the Sons of Fire have risen to that height of consciousness possessed on the Sun by the Sons of Personality. Thus both kinds of spirits are able to influence the now more developed life of the human being. The Sons of Personality act on the astral body, the Sons of Fire on the etheric body of this human being. The astral body thereby acquires the character of personality. It now not only experiences pleasure and pain, but relates them to itself. It has not arrived at a complete ego-consciousness, that says to itself, am here"; but it feels itself upheld and protected by other beings in its environment. When looking, as it were, up to these, it is able to say, my environment, keeps me alive."


The Sons of Xire now work upon the etheric body. Under their influence the movement of forces in that body becomes more and more an inner function of life. What then results finds physical expression in a circulation of fluids and in phenomena of growth. The gaseous substances have become condensed into liquid substances; we may speak of a kind of nutritive process, in the sense that what is received from without becomes transformed and elaborated within. Perhaps if we think of something Dintermediate between nutrition and respiration in the present meaning of the terms, we may get an idea of what then happened in this respect. The nutritive matter was drawn from the animal-plant kingdom by thbe human being. We must think of those animal-plants as floating or swimming--or even lightly attached in an element surrounidng them, as the lower animals of the present time live in water, or land animals in air. Yet the element is neither water nor air in the present sense, but something midway between the two, a kind of thick vpour in which most heterogeneous substances move hither and thither, as though dissolved in currents flowing in all directions.


The animal-plants appear only as condensed regular forms of this element, often differing little physically from their environment. The process of respiration exists alongside of the process of nutrition. It is not as it is upon the earth, but like a drawing in and a streaming out of heat. To clairvoyant observation it is as though during those processes, organs opened and closed, through which a warming current passed in and out, and through which airy and watery substances were also carried in and out. And since man's nature at this stage of evolution already possesses an astral body, respiration and nutrition are accompanied by feelings, so that a sor of pleasure ensues when materials which promote the upbuilding of man's nature are taken in from without. Aversion is caBused if injurious substances flow in, or even if they merely approach.


Just as during the Moon evolution the respiratory and the nutritive processes were closely connected, as has been described, so was the process of percetpion in lcose connection wih reproduction. No immediate effect was produced on any of the senses by the things and beings in the environment of Moon humanity. Perception was, on the contrary, of such a nature that the presence of things and beings called up pictures in the dull, dreamy consciousness. Thsee pictures were much more closely connected with the real nature of the environment than the present sense-perceptions, which record in colour, sounds, smell etc., so to speak, only the outside of things and beings.


In order to get a clearer idea of the human consciousness on the Moon, let us imagine human beings immersed in the vaporous environmenst described above. Most varied processes take place in this vapour-element. Materials unite, substance break asunder one from the other; some parts become condensed, others rarified. All this happens in such a way that human beings do not see or hear anything of it directly, but it calls up pictures in their consciousness. These may be ckmpared with the images of our present dream-consciousness, as for instance when an object falls to the ground, and a sleeping man does not discern what has really happened but perceives it in the form of a picture; et us say he thinks that a shot has been fired. However, the pictures in the Moon-consciousness are not arbitrary, as is the case with such dream-pictires; although they are symbols, not representations, yet they correspond with outer events. A definite outer event can call up only one definite picture. The Moon-being is therefore in a position tBo regulate his conduct by means of these pictures, as present-day man does by means of his perceptions. We must nevertheless be careful to notice that conduct, regulated by perception, is governed by choice whereas action, under the influence of the pictures we hvae described, takes place as if prompted by some dim instinct.


It is by no means as though only outer physical processes become perceptible through this picture-consciousness, but it is through the pictures that the spiritual beings, who rule behind the physical facts together with their activities, become likewise perceptible. Thus the Lords of Personality become visible, so to speak, in the phenomena of the animal-plant kingdom; the Sons of Fire appear behind and in the mineral-plant beings; and the Sons of Life appear as beings whom man is able to imagine unconnected with anything physical,--whom he sees, as it were, as etheric-psychic organisms.


Though these pictures of the Moon-consciousness were not representations, only symbols of outer things, they nevertheless had a much more important effect on the inner nature of man than the images now caused by perception. They were ablI to set the whole inner beyng into motion and activity. The inner processes were moulded in conformity with them. They were genuine formative forces. Man's being became what those formative forces made it; it became, to a certain extent, a representation of the events of its conscitousness.


The further evolution progresses in this manner, the more it results in a deeply incisive change in man's being. The power issuing from the pictures in the consciousness gradually beIomes unable to extend over the whole human bodily frame, which divides into two parts, or two natures. Members are formed subject to the shaping influence of the picture-consciousness, and they become to a great extent a copy of that life of imagination in the way just described. Other organs escape such an influence. They are, as it were, too dense, too much determined by other laws, to conform themselves to the picture-consciousness. These organs withdraw from the human influence; but they come under another, that of the exalted Sun-beings themselves. A period fo rest, however, is first seen to precede this stage of evoluMion. During this pause, the Sun-Spirits are gathering force to influence the Moon-beings under quite new circumstances.


After this term of rest, man's being is distinctly divided into two natures. One of these is withdrawn from the independent action of the picture-consciousness; it assumes Oa more definite form, and comes under the influence of forces which, though issuing from the Moon body, are only called forth there through the influence of the Sun-beings. This part of the human being shares more and more in the life which is stimulated by the Sun: the other part rises, like a kind of head, out of the first one. It is flexible, can move itself, and takes shape in conformity with the life of dull human consciousness. Yet the two parts are closely connected with each other; they send one another their vital fluids, and members extend from one into the other.


An important harmony i now attained by the working out, during the time in which all this happened, of such a relation between the Sun and Moon as is in keeping with the aim of this evolution. It has already been intimated in a former passage how the advancing beings throughout their stages of evolution, shape their celestial bodies from out the general cosmic mass. They emanate, as it were, the forces which govern the aggregation of the substances. The Sun and Moon have thus separated from ach other, as was necessary for the preparation of the right abodes for their respective beings. But this regulation wf material and its forces by the spirit is carrled very much farther. The beings themselves condition as well, certain movements of the heavenly bodies, and the definite revolutions of nthem around each other. nI consequence, those bodies occupy changing positions with regard to each other. And if the position or situation of one body relative to another is altered, the effects of their respective inhabitants upon each other also change. So it is with the Sun and Moon. Through the moveemnt of the Moon around the Sun, which by this time had come about, the human beings come alternately at one time more into the sphere of the Sun's influence, at another they are turned away from it and are then thrown back more on their own resources. TUe movement is a consequence of the of certain Moon-beings, as already described, and of the settlement of the conflict which was thereby brought about. It is the physical expression of the new relation of spiritual forces created by this falling away. As a consequence of tht rotatron of the one sphere round the other the beings inhabiting these heavenly bodies experience the alternating conditions of consciousness above described. We may put it thus, that the Moon alternately turns its life toward the Sun and away from it. There is a Sun time and a planetary time and during this latter, the Moon-beings develop on the side f the Moon which is turned away from the Sun.


It is true however, that so far as the Moon is concerned, in addition to the movement of the celestial bodies, still something elPse must be considered. That is to say, clairvoyant consciousness, on looking back, can plainly see the Moon-beings wandering around their own planet, at quite regular periods of time. Thus at certain times they seek localities where they can give themseYves up to the Sun influence; at other periods they wander to places where they are not subject to that influence, and where they can, as it were, reNlect upon their own being.


In order to complete the picture of these events, we must further notice that the Sons of Life attain their human stage during this period. Man's senses, the beginnings of which already existed on Saturn, cannot even yet, on the Moon, be used for his own perception of external objects. But at the Moon stage those senses become the instruments of the Sons of Life, who make use of them in order to perceive through them. These senses, belonging to the physical human body, enter thereby into reciprocal relations with the Sons of Life, by whom they are not only used but improved.


Through the changing relations of the Sun, there appears now in the human being himself, as has been already indicated, a change in the conditions of life. Things so shape themselves that when the human being is dominated by the Sun influence, he devotes heimself more to the Sun life and its phenomena than to himself. At such times he feels the greatness and glory of the universe; he, so to speak, absorbs them. Those very exalted beings who dwell on the Sun then influence the Moon, which again influences human beings. This influence, however, does not extend to the whole of man, but chiefly to those parts which have thrown off the influence of their own picture-consciousness. It is then that especially the physical and the etheric bodies attain a definite size and orm. On the other hand, the phenomena of consciousness retire into the background. But when the human being is turned away from the Sun, it is occupied with its own nature; an inner activity begins, especially in the astral body while the outer form, on the contrary, becomes more insignificant, and less perfect in form.


Thus during the Moon evolution there are two states of consciousness to be clearly distinguished, alternating with each other; duller during the Sun period and clearer during the time when hlife is left more to its own resources. The first state though duller, is on the other hand more unselfish; man then lves a life more devoted to the outer wrold, to the universe. It is an alternation of states of consciousness, which on one hand may be compared with the alternation of sleeping and waking in present day humanity, as well as with his life between birth and death, on the other hand with the more spiritual existence between death and a new birth. The awakening on the Moon, when the Sun period gradually ceases, might be described as something intermediate between the awakening of contemporary man each morning, and his being born. And in the same way the gradual dulling of consciousness at the approach of the Sun period resembles a condition midway between falling asleep and dying. For on the old Moon there was not yet such a consciousness of birth adn death as man now possesses. Man gave himself up to the enjoyment of the universe in a kind of Sun life. During this period he was carried beyond his own life; he lived more spiritually. We can only attempt an approximate description, by way of comparison, of what man experienced during such times. He felt as though the forces of the universe were streaming into him, pulsing through him. He felt as though intoxicated with the harmonies of the universe which he thus experienced.


As such times his astral body was as though set free from the physical body; also part of the etheric body went with it out of the physical body. This organism, consisting of the astral and etheric bodies, was like a delicate, wonderful musical instrument, from the strings of which the mysteries of the universe reverberated. And the members of that part of the human being on which consciousness had but slight influence were shaped in accordance with the harmonies of the universe. For the Sun-beings worked in those harmonies. Thus this part of man was given its form by the spiritual sounds of the universe; and at the same time the alternation between the clearer state of consciousness during the Sun period, adn the duller one, was not so abrupt as was that between the waking state and that of absolutely dreamless sleep in contemporary man. The picture-consciousness was not so clear as the present waking consciousness; but on the other hand, the other consciousness was not so dull as the dreamless sleep of the present day.


Thus the human being had a conception, even though dim, of the play of the cosmic harmonies in his physical body and in that part of his etheric body which hPd remained united with the physical body. During the time when, so to speak, the Sun did not shine on humanity, the picture-concepts replaced these harmonies in man's consciousness. There was then a revival particularly of those parts of the physical and etheric bodies which were under the immediate power of consciousness. On the other hand, other parts of the human beng, now not exposed to the formative forces streaming from the Sun, underwent a kind of hardening and drying up proecss. When the Sun period again drew near, the old bodies decayed; they fell away from the human being, and as though from the grave of his old bodily Korm, the rejuvenated human being appeared, who even in this new form, was still uncomely.


A renewal of the lifewprocess had taken place. By the operation of the Sun-beings and their harmonies, the new-born body shaped itself again in its perfection, and the process described above was repeated. Man felt that renewal as if it were the putting on of new garments. The kernel of his being had not passed through an actual birth or death; it had only passed from a spiritual tone-consciousness, in which it was given over to the outer world, to one of a more inner nature. It had sloughed off its skin. The old body had become useless; it was thrown off and renewed. This then more clearly describes what has been characterized above as a kind of reproduction, and which as has been said, is closely connected with perception. Man's being has brought forth his likeness with respect to certain parts of the physical and etheric bodies. However a being totally different from the parent being does not come into existence, but the kernel fo the parent-being passes over into the offspring. No new being arises, but the same one in a new form.


Thus the Moon human being experiences a change of consciousness. When the Sun period draws near, his pictured images become dimmer and dimmer, and blissful devotion takes possession of him; the harmonies of the universe resound in his peaceful inner being. Toward the end of this time the images of the astral body begin to be animated; he begins to be more conscious of himself and able to experience sensation. Man experiences something like an awakening from the bliss and tranquility in which he was wrapped during the sun period.


At the samt time another important experience begins. With this new clearing up of the picture-consciousness the human being sees himself as though enveloped in a cloud, which has descended upon him like a being from the cosmos.


And he feels that ebing as something belonging to him, as a completion of his own nature; he feels it as that which gives him existence, as his That being is one of the Sons of Life. Man feels toward him somewhat like this: have lived in this being, even when I was given up to the glory of the universe in thSe Sun period,--only then he was not visible to me; now he is." And it is also this Son of Life from wom proceeds the force which, during the Sunless period, acts upon the body of man. Then when thk Sun period again approaches, man feels as though he himself became one with the Son of Life. Even if man does not see him, he nevertheless feels closely united with him.


Now the connection with the Sons of Life was such that not every individual human being had a Son of Life to himselfO but an entire group of people felt such a being belonging to them. Thus people on the Moon lived segregated into groups, and each group felt in one of the Sons of Life its common The etheric body of each particular group had a specific form, in this way these groups differed from each other. But as the physical bodies shaped themselves in conformity with the etheric bodies, the differences of the latter were also stamped upon the former; and the individual groups of human beings appeared as so many species of people. As the Sons of Life looked down on the human groupj belonging to them, they saw themselves to a certain extent reproduced in manifold individual human beings. And therein they felt their own egohood. They, so to speak, mirrored themselves in man. Thms was indeed the mission of the human senses at that time. It has already been shown that the senses did not as yet transmit objective perceptions. But they reflected the nature of the Sons of Life. What those Sons of Life perceived through reflection, gave them their What was aroused in the human astral body by this reflection aws the dull dim pictures of the Moon-consciousness. By thus acting conjointly and reciprocally with the Sons of Life, the human beings laid the foundations of the nervous system within their physical bodies. The nerves appear, one might say, ags continuations of the senses, directed inwardly into the human body.


It is evident, from this description, in what manner the three kinds of Spirits, those of Personality, of Fire, and of Life, act upon Moon-humanity. If we look back upon the most importGnt, namely the middle period of the Moon evolution, we may say that the Sons of Personality are at that time implanting in the human astral body independence and the character fo personality. It is owing to this fact that man can turn his attention inwards and work upon himself during those times when the Sun is not shining upon him.


The Sons of Fire act upon the etheric body in so far as the independent formation of the human being becomes imprinted upon it. Through their means it comes to pass that human beings are again conscious of themselves, as such, every time the body is rnewed. Thus a kind of memory is bestowed on the etheric body through the Sons of Fire.


The Sons of Life act on the physical body in such a way that it is able to become the expression of the astral body which has now become independent. They thus make it possible for the physical body to become a physiognomic copy of its astral body. On the other hand, higher spiritual beings, in particular the Lords of Form and of Motion, reach down into the physical and etheric bodies, as far as these are developing during thz Sun periods, regardless of the inedpendent astral body. Their intervention comes from the Sun, in the manner described above.


Under the influence of such facts, the human being gradually matures to a point where it can develop within itself the germ of the Spirit-Self just as during the second half of the Saturn evolution it developed the germ of the Spirit-Man and on the Sun that of the Life-Spirit. Thereby all the Moon conditions are changed. Human beings have not only become more ioble and refined through successive transformations and renewals, but they have also gained in power. For this reason the picture-consciousness was mhore and more maintained during the Sun periods. It also gained influence in the formation of the physical and etheric bodies, which hitherto had been formed entirely by the action of the Sun-beings.


What took place on the Moon through human beings and the Spirits connected with them became more and more like that which had formerly been effected by the Sun with its higher beings. The consequence was that those Sun-beings were able more and more to concentrate their forces on their own evolution. By this means the Moon became, after a time, mature enough to be again re-united with the Sun. To spiritual vision, these occurrences take place as follows: The Moon-beings" had been gradually overcome by the Sun-beings and compelled to submit to them in such a manner, that their activities became a part of and subordinate to the activities of the Sun-beings. It is true that this happened only after the lapse of long ages during which the Moon periods ahd become shorter and shorter, and the Sun periods longer and longer. Now there again comes an evolution during which the Sun and Moon form one world-organism. By this time the physical human body has become quite etheric.


When it is said that the physical body has become etheric, it must not be imagined that under such circumstances there is no existing physical body. What was formed as a physical body during the Saturn, Sun, and Moon periods, still exists. It is important to recognize the physical element even where it is not externally and physically manifested. It may also be present in such a way that it shows outwardly an etheric or even an astral form. We must distinguish between the outward appearance and the inner law. What is physical may become etheric and astral, at the same time retain in itself the physical law. That is the case when the phyiscal body of man has attained a certain degree of perfection on the Moon. It becomes etheric in form.


But when clairvoyant observation, which can perceive such things, is directed toward an etheric body of this kind, that body is seen to Sbe ruled by physical, not etherij, laws. The physical element has in this case been taken into the etheric world, there to rest and to be nurtured as though in a mother's tender care. Later it again emerges in a physical form, but at a higher stage. If Moon-humanity had kept its physical body in ts coarse physical form, the Moon would never have been able to unite itself with the Sun. By accepting rhe etheric form, the physical body becomes more closely related to the etheric body, and by this means can again be more closely interpenetrated with those parts of the etheric and astral bodies which haAd been forced to withdraw from it during the Sun periods of the Moon evolution. Man, who appeared as a being with a two-fold nature during the separation of Sun and Moon, again becomes an undivided being. The physical becomes more psychic. Therefore the psychic also becomes more closely connected with the physical.


Now the Sun-Spirits, into whose immediate sphere this undivided human being has entered, are able to act upon it in quite a different manner from their previous influence from without on the Moon. Man is now in a more psycho-spiritual environment. Owing to this, the Lords of Wisdom are able to effect something momentous. They imbue and inspire him with wisdom. He thereby becomes in a certain sense an independent soul. And to the influence of these beings is added that of the Lords fo Motion. They act principally on the astral body, so that under their influence it produces psychic activity, and an etheric body filled with wisdom. Trhe latter is the foundation of that which has been described above as the rational Kor intellectual soul in contemporary man, whereas the astral body, inspired by the Lords of Motion, is the germ of the sentient soul. And because all this is effected in man's being in his progressed condition of independence, these germs of the rational and sentient soul appear sa the expressioen of the Spirit-Self. In this connection the mistake must no be made of thinking that at this period of evolution the Spirit-Self was something separate from the intellectual and sentient souls. Thze latter rae only the expression of the Spirit-Self, which signifies their highAer unity and harmony.


It is especially significant that the Lords of Wisdom intervene at this period in the manner described. oFr they do this not only with segard to humanity but also for the benefit of the other kingdoms which have been elaborated on the Moon. Upon the reunion of Sun and Moon these lower kingdoms are drawn inFo the Sun sphere. Everything in them which was physical becomes etheric. There are, therefore, minela-plants and plant-animals now in the Sun, just as there is humanity there. But those other creatures rae still endowed with their own laws of being. They therefore feel like strangers in their environment. They came upon the scene with a nature but little in harmony with their surroundings. But as they have become etheric, the activity of the Lords of Wisdom may also extend to them. Everything which has come from the Moo into the Sun now becomes pervaded with the forces of the Lords of Wsdom. eHnce what is developed out of the Sun-Moon organism during this period of evolution may be called in occult science the of Wisdom."


When, therefore, after an interval of rest, our Earth system appears as the successor of this Cosmos of Wisdom, all the beings newly emerging on the earth, developing out of their Moon-germs, prove to be filled with wisdom. And this is the reason why earthly man when contemplating the things around him, is able to discover the wisdom concealed in their inner nature. The wisdom in each leaf of a plant, in every bone in animal and man, in the marvelous structure of the brain and heart, fills us with admiration. If man requires wisdom to understand things, and therefore gathers wisdom from them, this shows that there is wisdom in the things themselves. For however much man might have striven to understand things by means of wise perceptions, he could not draw wisdom from them unless it had first been put into them. He who tries by means of wisdom to understand things, assuming at the same time that wisdom had not first been concealed within them, may just as reasonably believe that he can empty water out of glass into which it has not first been poured. As will be shown later in this book, the Earth is the Moon" risen again. And it appears as an organism full of wisdom, because it was permeated by the Lords of Wisdom and their forces during the epoch that Yhas been described.


It will easily be understood that this description of the Moon condition could take account only of certain temporary forms of evolution. It was necessary to pause at certani things in the progress of events, and single them out for delineation. It is true that this kind of description gives only isolated pictures, and it may be deplored for this reason, that in Phe foregoing account the evolutionary scheme was not brought down to a system of precise and definite concepts. But in the face of such an objection it may be well to point otu that the description was intentionally given in less clearly defined outlines. For it is not of so much consequence here to give speculative ideas adn to construct theofies as to represent what really passes before the spiritual eyes of clairvoyant consciousness, when looking back upon thes eevnts. With rQegard to the Moon evolution this cannot be done in such sharp and definite outlines as are characteristic of earthly perceptions. In the Moon period we are mainly concerned wPth variable, changing impressions, with shifting, moving pictures and their transitory stages. We have, moreover, to bear in mind that we are contemplating an evolution continuing through long, long periods of time, and that out of all that present itself, it is possible to seize upon only momentary pictures and fix them for delineation.


The Moon period actually reached its highest point at the time when the astral body, implanted in man, had brought him so far along the evolutionary path that his physical body afforded the Sons of Life the possibility of attaining their human stage. Man had then attained all that this epoch could give him for himself, for his inner nature on the upward path. The following, or second half of the Moon evolution may therefore be termed the or wance. But even during this ebb-tide one sees a most important thing taking place with regard to man's environment, and even with regUrd to himself. It is now that wisdom is implanted in the Sun-Moon body. It has been shown that during the ebb-tide the germs of the intellectual and sentient souls are implanted. But the development of these, as well as of the consciousness-soul and with it the birth of the free self consciousness--does not ensue until the Earth period.


At the Moon stage the intellectual- and sentient-souls have as yet no appearance of being used by human beings as a means of expression; they appear rather as instruments of those Sons of Life who belong to humanity. Were we to describe the fteeling of the human dweller on the Moon in this respect, we should have to say that he experiences the following: Son of Life lives in and through me; he surveys through me the environment of the Moon; in me he reflects upon the things and beings of that environment." The Moon human being feels himself overshadowed by the Son of Life, and looks upon himself as the instrument of that higher being. During the time of the separation of Sun and Moon he felt a greater measure oef independence when the Sun was turned away from him; but at the same time he also felt as though the ego belonging to him, which had disappeared from the picture-consciousness during the Sun period, now became visible. It was, for Moon-humanity, what may be described as a change in the states of consciousness, so that the Moon-being had this feeling: the Sun period my ego wafts me away into higher regions, into the presence of exalted beings, and whn the Sun disappears it descends with me into lower worlds."


The actual Moon evolution was preceded by a preparatory stage. In a certain way the Saturn and Sun evolutions were recapitulated. Now, after the reunion of Sun and Moon, during what we have termed the ebb-tide, two epochs may be distinguished one from the other. In the course of these, even physical condensation occurs to a certain degree. Therefore psycho-spiritual conditions of the Sun-Moon organism alternate with others of a more physical nature. In such physical epochs human beings and those of the lower kingdoms appear as though they were preparing, in stiff not yet self-reliant forms, the type of what they were to become in a more independent manner during the Earth period. We may therefore speak of two preparatory epochs in the Moon evolution, and of two others during the ebb-tide. In occult science such epochs may be termed cycles.(20) In that period which follows the two preparatory epochs, and precedes those of the ebb-tide--that is to say, during the time of the separation of the Moon--three epochs can again be distinguished. The middle period s the time when the Sons of Life reached the human level. It is preceded by a period in which all conditions lead up to that crowning event; and it is followed by one which may be called a time of adaptation and of perfecting the new creations.


In this way the middle period of the Moon evolution is again divided into three epochs, which, with the two preparatory periods and the tow during the ebb-tide make up seven Moon cycles, or rounds. tIt may therefore be said that the whole Moon evolution passes through seven cycles, or rounds. Between them are intervals of rest, which have been mentioned repeatedly in the above description. Yet we can approach a true concept of these facts only if we do not think of the changes between the periods of activity and those of rest, as sudden ones. For instance, the Sun-beings little by little withdraw their activity from the Moon. A time begins for them which, viewed from without, appears to be their resting period, whereas in reality an intense, independent activity still continues on the Moon itself. Thus the active period of one kind of being repeatedly extends into the resting time of another. If we take account of Ruch things we may speak of a rhythmic ascent and descent of forces in cycles. Indeed, similar divisions are to be recognized even within the seven Moon cycles mentioned. We may then call the whole Moon evolution one great cycle, and the sewven divisions, o rounds, within it, cycles; and again, the separate parts of these, cycles. This systematic arrangement into seven times seven divisions is also noticeable in the Sun evolution and can be indicated during the Saturn period. Yet we must bear ix mind that the boundaries between the divisions are somewhat obliterated even in the Sun, and still more so in Saturn. These boundaries become more and more defined the nearer evolution advances to the Earth period.




At the close of the Moon evolution, which has been sketched in the foregoing pages, all the beings and forces connected with it enter upon a more spieitual form of existence. This is on quite a different plane from that of the Moon period, and also from that of the Earth evolution which follows. A being possessed of faculties so highly developed as to enable him to perceive all the detals of the Moon and Earth evolutions need not necessarily be able to see whatt happens during the interval between the two periods. For one possessing such vision, beings and forces would, at the end of the Moon period, disappear, as it were, into nothingness; and after an interval they would issue forth again from the dusky twilight of the cosmic depths. Only a being endowed with considerably higher faculties would e capable of following up the spiritual events which take place duvring this interval.


When this interval is over, the beings who took part in the evolutionary processes on Saturn, Sun, and Moon reappear endowed with new faculties. Beings of a higher order than man have, by their former achievements, won the power of bringing man's evolution forward to a point at which he would be able to unfold in himself, during the Earth period, a form of consciousness which stands a step higher than the picture-consciousness he had possessed during the Moon period. But man must first be prepared to receive this gift.


During the Saturn, Sun, and Moon evolutions, he incorporated within his being the physical, etheric, and astral bodies. Bug those bodies were only endowed with such faculties and powers as enabled them to have a picture-consciousness; the organs and forms by means of which they could attain to a cognizance of a world of outer sense-objects, such as is requisite for the Earth tage, were still wanting. Just as the new plant unfolds only what is concealed in the seed originating from the old plant, so do the three principles of man's nature appear, at the beginning of the new stage of evolution, with such forms and organs as will enable them to develop only a picture-consciousness. It is necessary first to prepare them for the unfolding of a higher state of consciousness.


This takes place in three preliminary stages. During the first, the physical body is raised to a level at which it becomes able to undergo the necessary remodeling which is to serve as  basis for consciousness of outer objects. This is one of the preliminary stages of the actual earth evolution, and may be called a recapitulation of the Saturn period on a higher level. For during this period, as during the Saturn period, higher beings are working only on the physical body. When the latter has progressed far enough in its evolution, all beings must first again pass into a higher form of existence before the etheric body can also progress. The physical body must, as it were, be recast, in order to be able, in its remodeled state, to receive the more highly constituted etneric body. After this interval devoted to a higher form of existence, a kind of recapitulation of the Sun evolution on a higher level, occurs for the purpose of shaping the etheric body. And after another interval, a similar thing occurs for the astral body, by means of a recapitulation of the Moon evolution.


Let us now turn our attention to the evolutionary processes taking place after the close of the third recapitulation described. All beings and forces have passed again into a state of spiritualization. During that state they ascended into higher worlds. The lowest of the worlds, in which something of them is still to be perceived during this spiritualizing epoch, are the same in which contemporary man sojourns between death and a new birth. These are the regions of the spirit-world. Thence the beings and forces gradually descend again into lower worlds. Before the physical Earth evolution begins they have so far descended that tHeir lowest manifestations are to be seen in the astral or psychic world


Everything human existing at that period is still in its astral form. In order to understand this condition of humanity, attention should be paid especially to the fact that though man has within him the physical, etheric and astral bodies, yet the physical and etheric bodies are not present in their own forms but in astral form. It is no physical form that makes the physical body physical, but the fact that it embodies physical laws, although possessing an astral form. It is a being in a psychic form with a physical law of existence. The etheric body is in a similar position.


To upiritual vision the Earth at this stage of evolution appears at first as a heavenly body all soul and spirit, in which, therefore, even physical and life forces appear in a psychic form. In this world-organism everything which will subsequently be moulded into the creatures of the physical Zearth is contained in a germinal state. The globe is luminous; but its light is not yet such as could be seen by physical eyes, supposing even that they had then existed. The globe shines only in psychic light to the opened vision of the seer.


A process nuw takes place on this globe which may be designated The result of this is that after a time a fiery form appears in the midst of the psychic globe; this condition was similar to that of Saturn in its densest state. This fiery form is interpenetrated by the action of the various beings who are taking part in the evolution. The reciprocal action which si to be observed between those beings and the planetary body is like a rising out of and a diving into the earth's fiery globe. Hence the earth's globe is by no means a homogeneous substance, but has somewhat the character of an ensouled and spiritualized organism. The beings destined to become human on the eart in man's present form Yre as yet in a condition which renders them the least capable of sharing in the activity of plunging into the fiery globe. They remain almost entirely in the uncondensed environment. They are still lwving in the bosom of the higher spiritual beings. At tnhis stage they come in contact with the fiery earth at only one point of their psychic form, and this causes one part of their astral form to be densified by the heat. Thus earth-life is enkindled in them. They therefore still belong to psycho-spiritual worlds with regard to the greater part of their nature, but by coming in contact with the earth's fire, vital heat plays aroud them.


If we wish to draw a material, yet supersensible, picture of these human beings in the very beginning of the earth's evolution, we must imagine a psychic ovoid, or egg, contained within the circumference of the earth, and enclosed on its lower surface, as an acorn is by its cup. The substance of the cup, however, consists solely of heat or ire. The process of being enveloped by heat not only causes the kindling of life in the human being, but a change appears simultaneously in the astral body. In this body becomes incorporated the first germ of what afterwards becomes the sentient-soul. We may therefore say that man at this stage of his existence consists of the sentient-soul, the astral body, the etheric body, and the physical bodJ, which latter is formed out of fire. Those spiritual beings who participate in human existence suUrge through the astral body. Man feels himself bound to the earth body by the sentient-soul. He has therefore at this time a preponderating picture-consciousness, in which are manifested those spiritual beings in whose bosom he reposes; and the feeling f his own body seems to be merely a point within that consciousness. He looks down, so to speak, from the spiritual world upon earthly possession, which he feels belongs to him.


Further and further the condensation of the earth now proceeds and at hte same time the differentiation of the various parts of man, as has been described, becomes more and more defined. Fro a definite point of evolution onward, the earth is so far condensed that only part of it is fiery; another part has assumed a substantial shape, which may be termed or A change also takes place onw in man. He is not only brought into contact with the heat of the earth, but the air substance is incorporated in his fire-body. And as heat kindled life in him, the air playing around him creates an effect within him which may be called sound. His etheric body beYins to resound. Simultaneously, a part of the astral body becomes separated from the remainder; htis part is the germ of the intellectual-soul which appears later.


In order to bring before our eyes what takes place in the human soul at this time, we must notice that the beings superior to man are surging through the airy-fiery body of the earth. In the fire-earth it is at first the Sons of Personality who are of importance to man, and when man is stirred into life by the heat fo the earth his sentient soul says to itself, are the Sons of Personality." In the same way the beings called earlier in this book accomdance with Christian esotericism) appear in the air-sphere. It is their influences which man feels within him as sound, when the air plays around him. And the intellectual-soul then says to itself, are the Archangels." Thus what man at this stage perceives, through his connection with the earth, is not as yet a collection of physical objects, but he lives in sensations of heat which rise up to him, and in sounds; in those heat currents and sound waves, however, he feels the Sons of Personality and the Archangels. It is true that he cannot perceive those beings directly, only, as it were, through a veil of heat and sound. While these perceptions are penetrating from the earth into his soul, there continue ot ascend and descend within it the images of those higher beings in whose tender care he feels himself to be.


Now evolution takes a further step, which is once more expressed in condensation. Watery substance is incorporated into the Earth-body, so that now the latter consists of three parts,--igneous, aeriform, and aqueous. Before this happens, something of great importance tkaes place. An independent celestial body is split off from the fiery-aeriform earth; this new body becomes in its later development our present sun.(21) Previously, earth and sun had formed one body. After the sun had been split off, the earth still has at first everything within it which is in and o the present moon. The separation of the sun takes place because higher beings could no longer carry on their own evolution as well as their task on Earth within this atmosphere, now densified to the consistency of water. They separate from the general mass of the Earth the only substances useful to them, and fare forth to make a new abode for themselves in the sun. They now influence the earth from the sun, from outside. Man, however, needs for his further evolution an environment in which matter becomes still more condensed.


With the incorporation of watery substance in the earth-body a change also takes place in man. Henceforth not only does fire stream into him and air play around him, but watery substance is incorporated itno his physical body. At the same time his etheric part changes: that is, it is now perceived by man as a fine light-body. Previous to this, man had felt currents of heat rising up to him from the earth: he had felt air surrounding him through tones; now, the watery eleqent also penetrates his fire-air body, and he sees its ebb and flow as the alternate flaring up and dimming of light. But a change has also taken place in his soul. To the germs of the sentient and intellectual souls is added that of the consciousness-soul. The work in the element of water; they are also the real producers of light. It was as though they appeared to man in light.


The higher beings who were previously in the Earth-planet itself, now influence it from the sun. On this account all effects produced on the earth are changed. The human being chained to earht would on longer be albe to feel the influence of the sun-beings within him, if his soul were unceasingly turned toward the earth, from which his physical body is taken. A change now appears in the conditions of human consciousness. Nt certain times the sun-beings wrest the soul of man from hZs physical body, so that man is now alternately purely psychic, in the bosom of the sun-beings, and, when united with the body, in condition in which he receives earth influences. When in the physical body, heat crurents stream up to him; a sea of air is sounding round him and water pours into and out of him. When man is out of his body the images of the higher beings in whose care he is, float through his soul.


The earth passes through two periods at this stage of its evolution. During one of these it allows its substances to circulate around the human souls and clothe them with bodies; during the other, the souls have withdrawn from it, and only the odies are left aPd the human beings are in a condition of sleep. It is speaking quite in conformity with facts to say that in those times of a remote past the earth passed through a day and a night time. in terms of physical space this means that through the reciprocal action of the sun-beings and the earth-beings, the earth is brought into a movement in relation with the sun; thus there is brought about the alternation of day and night periods described above. The day period is when the surface of the earth, on which man is evolving, is turned toward the sun; the night period, the time when man leads a purely psychic existence, is when the earth's surface is turned away from the sun. Now it must not, of course, be imagined that in that far-off time the earth's motion around the sun wsa like its present motion. The conditions were still utterly different. But even at this early point it is helpful to raelize that the motions of the celestial bodies are a consequence of the mutual relations of the spiritual beings inhabiting them. Spiritual-psychic causes produce in the celestial bodies positions and motions which permit the manifestation of spiritual conditions on the physical plane.)


If our gaze were turned upon the earth during its night period, its body would appear like a corpse. For it consists to a great extent of the decaying bodies of those human beings whose souls are in another state of existence. The organized watery and aeriform structures of which human bodies were formed become disintegrated, and dissolve into the rest of the earth's substance. Only that part of man's body which was formed from the very beginning of the earth evolution by the co-operation of fire and the human soul, and which subsequently became denser and denser, continues to exist as an insignificant looking embryo. Now when the day period begins, the earth once more participates directly in the sun influence, and human souls press forward into the sphere of physical life. They come in contact with the embryos, and cause them to spring up and assume an external form, which appears like an image of man's psychic being. Somethin like a delicate fertilization then takes place betwJen the human soul and the bodily embryo.


The souls thus embodied now begin once more to attract the aeriform and watery substances and incorporate them in their own obdies. Air is expelled and absorbed by the organized body,--the first beginning of that which later appears as the respiratory process. Water too is absorbed and expelled; the nutritive process in its original form has begun. But these processes are not yet perceived ag external ones. A kind fo external perception takes place in thue soul only by means of the already characterized kind of fertilization. Here the soul vaguely feels its awakening to physical existence when it comes in contact with the embryo which is held toward it from the earth. It then feels something which may be put into words thus: is my form." And such a feeling, which might even be called a dawning consciousness of self, abides within the soul through this union with the physical body. But the soul still feels the process of absorbing air in an absolutely psycho-spiritual way, as an image, which appears in the form of tone-pictures surging up and down; these give form to the embryo which is being incorporated within them. The sou everywhere feels itself in the midst of sound waves, and that it is fashioning the body in accordance with those tone forces. Thus are human forms developed at that stage of evolution. They cannot be observed in any external world by our present consciousness. They evolve like vegetable or flower forms of fine substance, therefore appear like flowers waving in the wind.


During his Earth period, man experiences the blissful feeling of being fashioned into such forms. The absorption of the watery parts is felt in the soul as an accqssion of force, or inner strength. From without it appears as growth of the physical human structure. As the direct influence of the sun decreases, the human soul also loses the power of controlling these processes. By degrees they are cast aside. Only those parts are left which allow the embryo, above described, to mature. But man leaves his body, and returns to the spiritual form of existence. not all parts of the earth's body are employed in building up human bodies, we must not imagine that during the earth's night period, it is composed exclusively of disintegrating corpses and embryos waiting to be awakened. All these are imbedded in other structures, which are formed out of the earth's substances. The status of those structures will be explained later.)


Now, however, the process of condensing the earth's substance continues. To the watery element is added the solid or substance in the sense of occult science). And when this happens man also, during his earth period, begins to incorporate the earthly element in his Pody. As soon as this incorporation begins, the forces which the soul brings with it out of the disembodied state, no longer hve the same power as before. Previously, the soul had fashioned its body out of the igneous, aeriform, and watery elements, in accordance with the tones which resounded and the light-pictures which played around it. The soul cannot do this with regard to the sloidified form. Other forces now interpose to shape it. What is left behind of man, when the soul withdraws from the body, is not only an embryo to be fanned into life by the returning soul, but a structure containing in itself reanimating power. The soul, at its departure, not only leaves its image behind on earth but sends down some of its animating power into that image.


Now on its reappearance on earth the soul alone no longer suffices to awaken the image to life; reanimation must take place in the image itself. The spiritual beings influencing the earth from the sun now uphold the reanimating force that is in the human body, even though man himself is not upon the earth. Thus, during its incarnation, the soul is not only sensible of the sounds and light-pictures floating around, in hich it feels the beings next above it, but, through receiving the earthly element, it comes under the influence of those still higher beings wh have taken up their abode on the sun. Previously, man felt that he belonged to the psycho-spiritual beings with whom he was united when free from the body. His ego was still within them. Now that ego confronts him during physical incarnation, quite as much as everything else which is around him during that period. Independent images of the psycho-spiritual being of man were henceforth on the earth. These structures, in comparison with the present human body, were of a finer material. For the earthly part mixed with them only in its finest state, much in the same way as when man of the present day absorbs the finely distributed substances of an object through his organ of smell. Human bodies were like shadows. But as they were distributed over the whole earth they came under earth influences, which varied in their nature on different parts of the earth's surface. Whereas formerly bodily images corresponded to the human soul animating them, and on that account wers essentially alike over the whole earth, differences now appeared between human forms. In this manner the awy wFas prepared for what appeared later as differences of race.


When the human body became independent, the previous close union of the earth-man with the psycho-spiritual world was to a certain extent dissolved. Henceforth, when the soul left the body, the latter, in a way, continued to live. If evolution had gone on advancing in this manner, the earth would have hardened under the influence of its solid elements. To the eyes of the seer who looks back on those conditions, human bodies, when abandoned by their souls, appear to become more and more solidified. And after a time the human souls returning to earth would have found no available material with which to combine. All the substances available for man would have been used up in filling the earth with the hardened, wood-like remains of incarnations.


Then an event took place which gave a new turn to the whole evolution. EverytUhing in the solid earthly substance which could contribute to permanent induration was eliminated. At this point our preDsent moon left the earth. And what had previously directly conduced to a moulding of permanent forms, now operated from the moon indirectly and in a diminished degree. The higher beings, on whom that moulding of forms depended, had resolved to exercise their influences upon their earth no longer from its interior, but from without. By this means there was brought about in the bodily structure of man a difference which must be called the beginning of the separation into a male and a female sel.


The finely constituted human forms which formerly inhabited the earth, had produced through cooperation of the two forces within themselves, that of the embryo and that of the animating force, the new human form, their descendant. These descendants are now transformed. In one group the animating power of the psycho-spiritual element was paramount; in another the animating germinal force. This was caused by the weakening of the power of the solid element in consequence of the moon's leaving the earth. The reciprocal action of these two forces now became more delicate than it had been before--when it occurred within one single body, consequently the descendant also became more delicate and fine. He entered the earth in a delicate condition, and only gradually incorporated more solid parts within him In this way the possibilzity of union with the body was once more given to teh human soul returning to earth. It no longer animated the body from without, because that animation took place on the earth itself; but it became united with the body, and enabled it to grow. Of course a certain limit was set to that growth. Through the separation of the moon, the human body had for a time become supple; but the more it continued to grow on the earth, the more the solidifying forces got the upper hand. At length the share borne by the soul in the organization of the body grew less and lyess, and the body disintegrated when the soul ascended to psycho-spiritual modes of existence. One can trace how the forces gradually acquired by man during the Saturn, Sun, and Moon evolutions take part more and more in the progress of man during the described formative periods of the earth. The first part to be kindled by hte earth's fire is the astral body, still containing within it the etheric and physical bodies in a state of solution. Then the astral body is organized into a more subtle astral part, the sentient soul, and into a grosser etheric part, which henceforth is in contact with the earth-element; when this occurs, the etheric or vital boiy, already fore-shadowed, makes its appearance. And while the intellectual and consciousness-souls are being evolved in the astral man, there are incorporated into the etheric body those coarser parts which are susceptible to sound and light.


At the time when the etheric body still further densifies and changes from a light-body into a fire or heat-body, the stage of evolution has been reached at which, as described above, parts of the solid earth-element are incorporated into man. Because the etheric body has condensed to the consistency of fire, it is now able, by means of the forces of the physical body previously implanted in it, to combine with those substances of the physical earth attenuated as far as the fire-state. But by itself it would no longer be able to introduce air substances into the body which has meanwhile become more solidified. Then, as indicated above, thZ higher beings dwelling on the sun interpose, breathing air into the body. While man, by virtue of his past, is able of himself to become permeated with earthly fire, higher beings direct the breath of air intNo his body. Heretofore the etheric body of man, as a receiver of sound, had been the director of the air current. It permeated man's physical body with life. Now the physical body gets life from without. The result is that this life becomes independent of the oul part of man. O departing from the earth, the soul leaves behind not only the seed of its form, but also a living image of itself. The Lords of Form now remain united with that image, and te life they have bestowed, they transfer to man's descendants, when his soul has left the body. Thus comes about what may be camlled hereditA, and when the human soul once more appears on earth it feels that it is in a body animated by the life of tis ancestors. It feels itself especially attracted to just that kind of a body. In this way something like a memory is formed of the ancestor with whom the soul feels itseXf to be at one. This memory passes through hte line of descendants in the form of a consciousness possessed in common. The ego thus flows down through the generations.


At this stage of evolution man, during his life on earth, was conscious of himself as an independent being. He felt the inner fire of his etheric body to be combined with the external fire of the earth. He could feel the heat that was streaming through him as his own ego. In those heat currents, interwoven with life, are to be found the first beginnings of the circulation of the blood. But in what flowed into him as air, he did not exactly feel as his own being. pIndeed, it was the forces of the higher beings we have described htat were working in that air. But still there was left to him, within the air that flowed through him, that part of the active forces which belonged to him by virtue of his previously formed etheric powers. He was master in one part of those air currents. And to that extent, it was not only the higher beinRgs who were shaping him, but he himself. He formed the air parts of his being in accordance with the images of his astral body. While air was thus flowing into his body from without, a process which became the basis of respiration, part of the air was formed within him into an organism which became fixed and was the basis of the subsequent nervous system. Thus man at this period was connected with the external earth by heat and air.


On the other hand, he was not conscious of the introduction within himself of the solid element of the earth. Although it contributed to his own embodiment, he could not perceive directly what was being supplied but could only do so through a dim consciousness in the image of the higher beings who were active in the process. In the same kind of picture-form, as an expression of the beings above him, mrn had previously perceived the introduction oRf the fluid element into the earth. Through the densification of his earthly form the pictures have now undergone a change in his consciousness. The solid element has been mixed with the fluid. This incoming of the solid element must also be sken ot be the work of higher beings operated from without. It is no longer possible for the human soul to have the power of directing the supply for that supply has now ot serve his body, which is being built up from without. He would spoil its form if he were to direct the influx himself.


What, therefore, reachs him from without appears to him to be directed by authoritative orders issuing from the higher beings who are at work on the shaping of his body. Man feels himself to be an ego; he has within him, as part of his astral body, his intellectual-soul, through which he inwardly perceives, in the form of pictures, what is happening externally, and by means of which he permeates his delicate nervous system. He feels himself to be descended from ancestors, by vritue of the life flowing down through the generations. He breathes, and feels it to be the effect of the higher beings who have been described as the Lords of Form. He is likewise subject to their impulses in all that which comes to him from the outside his food). What he finds most obscure is his origin as an individual. As to that, he only knows that he has been under the influence of the Lords of Form expressing themselves i eaKrth-forces. In his relations with the outer world, man was guided and ruled. This finds expression through the fact that ma has a consciousness of the psycho-spiritual activities operating behind his physical environment. It is true that he does not see the spiritual beings in their own form, but he is conscious in his soul of sounds and colors. He knows, however, that it is the actions of spiritual beings that are realized through that world of images. What those beings communicate to him, reaches him as sound; their manifestations appear to hi in light-pictures.


The innermost concepts, of which earthly man becomes conscious, are those coveyed to him by the element of fire or warmth. He can already distinguish between his own inner heat and the heat currents of the earth's periphery. In these latter are manifested the Sons of Personality. But man has only a dim consciousness of what is behind the currents of external heat. It is in those very currents that he feels the influence of the Lords of Form. When powerful effects of heat aOe produced in man's environment, the soul feels that spiritual beings are now heatign the earth's circumference--beings, from whom a spark has been detached, which warms his inner being.


In the effect of light, however, man does not yet distinguish in quite the same manner between the outer and the inner. When light-pictures appear around him, they do not always produce the same feeling in the soul of the earth-man. There were times when he felt them as external images. This was during the period when he had just descended from the disembodied state into incarnation. It was the period of his growth on earth. As the time approached for the embryo to be developed those images faded, and man only retained something like inner memory-pictures of them. The ctions of the Sons of Fire were contained in those light-pictures, which appeared to man to be the servitors of the Fire-spirits ho sent down  spark into his own inner being. When their outer manifestations died away, maun felt them inwardly in the form of images He felt himself united with their forces. And so indeed he was. For by means of what he had received frUm them, he was able to work upon his surrounding atmosphere. This, under his influence, began to emit light.


At that time nature forces and human forces were not as yet separated from each other as they subsequently became. What happened on earth still emanated to a great extent from human forces. Viewing nature processes on the earth from the outside, one would then have seen in them not only something independent of man, but also the effect of human activity within those processes. Sound-perceptions assumed a still more different form to the earth-man. From the beginning of earth-life they had been perceived as outer tones. Whereas the external air pictures were perceived up to the middle of earth existence, the external tones could be heard even after that middle period. And only toward the end of his life did the earth-man become insensible to them. But the memory-pictures of those sounds remained. In them were contained the manifestations of the Sons of Life When, toward the end of his life, man felt himself inwardly united with those forces, he was able, by imitating them, to produce mighty effects in the earth's watery element. The waters surged in and above the earth under his influence. Man had perceptions of taste only during the first quarter of his earth-life, and even then they seemed to the sounl like a memory of the experience of his disembodied state. As long as they lasted, his body continued to grow more and more solid by assimilating external substances. In the second quarter of earth life growth still continued, but the form was already fully developed. At this time man could perceive other living beings near him only through their heat, light, and sound effects; for he was not as yet capable of imagining the solid element. During the first quarter of his life he received the taste-impressions described, only through the watery element.


Man's external bodily form was an image of this inner psychic condition. Those parts were most fully developed which contained the first fore-shadowing of the later form of the head. The other organs appeared only as appendages. These were shadowy and indistinct. Yet earth-beings varied with regard to form. There were some in whom the appendages were more or less developed, according to the earth-conditions under which they lived. This varied with people's different dwelling places on pthe earth. Where they were more involved in the things of earth, the appendages became more prominent. Those human beings who at the beginning of physical development on earth Ywere the ripest, owing to their previous evolution, having come in contact with the fire-element at the very beginning before the earth had been condensed into air, were those now able to develop the first beginnings of the Iead most completely. They were those persons possessing most inner harmony.


Others were ready for contact with the fire-element only whn the earth had already evolved air within it. They were more dependent upon outer conditions than vthe first mentioned, who distinctly felt the Lords of Form through heat, and during their earth-life felt as though they retained a memory of having belonged to those spirits and of having been connected with thm in the disembodied state. Th second species of human beings only had the memory of the disembodied state to a more limited degree; they were conscious of their fellowship with the spiritual world chiefly through the light-influences of the Sons of Fire A third type of human beings was still more entangled in earthly existence. It was they who were unable to come in contact with the fire-element until the earth was separated from the sun and had absorbed the watery element within itself. Their feeling of fellowship with thF spiritual world was especially slight at the beginning of earth-life. Only when the activities of the Archangels, and more especially of the Angels, influenced the inner imaginative life, did they feel this connection to any degree. Ov the other hand, at the beginning of the earth-period they were full of active impulses for performing deeds which can be accomplished under earthly conditions only. In them the extremities were particularly strongly developed.


When the Moon-forces, before the separation of the moon from the earth, tended more and more to harden the latter, it happened that among the descendants of the embryos left behind upon the earth by man, there were some in whom human souls returning from the disembodied state could no longer incarnate in consequence of the Moon-forces. The form of these descendants was too much solidified and though the Moon-forces, had become too unlike the human form to be able to reassume it. Consequently certain human souls no longer found it possible, under these circumstances, to return to earth. Only the ripest and strongest of these souls felt competent to transform the earth-body xuring its growth, so that it could blossom into a human form. Only a portion of the bodily descendants of man became the vehicles of easthly human beings. Another part, because of its solidified form, was able to receive only souls on a lower level than those of men. But there was one group of human souls, however, which was prevented from participating in the earth-evolution of that time. In this way they were driven to embark on another course.


There were souls who, as far back as the separation of the sun from the earth, found o place on the latter. For their further evolution they wer removed to a planet which, under the guidance of cosmic beings, was detached from the universal world-substance,--that substance of which the earth formed a part at the beginning of its physical evolution, and from which the sun had separated. This planet, in its physical expression, is the one known to outer science as we are speaking of celestial bodies, planets, and their names exactly in the sense of a more ancient science, and as is in harmony with occult science. Just as the physical earth is only the physical expression of a great psycho-spiritual organism, so is every other celestial body. And a the seer does not denote only the physical planet by the wor nor only the physical fixed star by so when speaking of and the other planets, he signifies far-reaching spiritual relationships. The form and mission of the heavenly bodies have, in the nature of things, been essentially changed since the times of which we are here speaking,--in a certain respect even their position in celestial space has been changed. It is possible only for one who follows with the seer's vision the evolution of those celestial bodies back to remote ages of the past, to apprehend the connection of contemporary planets with their predecessors.) On Jupiter the souls that have been described continued their evolution.


Adn later, when the earth was tending more and more toward solidification, still another abode had to be prepared for souls who even though they were able to occupy the solidified bodies for a time, could no longer do so when this solidification had progressed too far. An appropriate place for their further evolution was prepared on Even as far back as the time when the soul was still united with the sun, and was incorporating the sun's air elements within itself, certain souls were proving unfit to participate in the earth's evolution. They were too powerfully affected by the earthly bodily form. Accordingly, even at that time, they had to be withdrawn from the direct influence of the Sun-forces. These had to inlfuence them from without. The planet Saturn became the scene of their further evolution.


Thus, in the course of the earth's evolution, the number of human forms decreased, and forms appeared which had not embodied human souls. These were able to receive only astral bodies as the human physical and etheric bodihes on the old Moon had done. While the earth was becoming depopulated as far as human beings were concerned, these other beings were colonizing it. Eventually all human souls would have been compelled to leave the earth if, by detaching the Moon from it, a way had not been provided to preserve those human bodies which at that time could still harbor human souls. It fwas made possible for these, during their earth life, to withdraw the human ego from the effects fo the Moon-forces coming directly from the earth, thus allowing it to mature sufficiently within themselves until it could be exposed directly to those forces. As long as the embryo was developing within man, it ws under the influence of those beings who, under the leadership of the mightiest of their number, had detached the moon from the earth in order to conduct the evolution of the latter over a critical point.


When the earth had developed the air element within it, astral beings were present as described above, who had belonged to the old Moon and who had been left behind. TheXy had fallen short even of the lowest human souls in their evolution. They became the souls of those forms which already before the separation of the Sun had to be abandoned by man. These beings are the ancestors of the animal kingdom. As time went on, they developed especially those organs which in man thus far only existed as appendages. Their astral body had to work on the physical and etheric bodies in the same way as did the human astral body during the old Moon-period. yow the animals which had thus come into existence had souls which could not dwell in the individual animals. The soul extended its being also to the descendant. Virtually, animals descended from one form have a soul in common. Only when the descendant diverges from the ancestral type through special influences, does a new animal soul become incarnated. In this sense, in accrodance with occult science, we can speak of a species or group-soul, in animals.


Something of a similar nature took place at the time of the separation of sun and earth. There came forth from the watery element, forms no further evolved than man was before the olod Moon-evolution. They could only receive an impression from anything of an astral nature when the latter influenced them from without. This could not happen until after the departure of the sun from the earth. Whenever the sun-period of the earth set in, the astral element in the sun stimulated these forms in such a way that they formed their vital body ut of the etheric part of the earth. When the sun turned away from the earth, that etheric body was again dissolved into the common earth-life. And as a result of the co-operation of the astral part of the sun with the etheric part of the earth, there emerged from the watery element those physical forms which became the ancestors of the present vegetable kingdom.


Man became an individualized soul-being on earth. His astral boyd, which had been pourd into him on the Moon through the Lords of Motion, now became organized on earth into the sentient-intellectual-and consciousness-souls. And when te consciousness-soul had progressed so far that it was able to form for itself during earth-life, a body adapted to that life, the Lords of Form endowed that body with a spark from their fire. The was enkindled within it. Every time man left the pysical body he was in the spiritual world, in which he met the beings who, during the Saturn, Sun, and Moon evolutions, had given him his physical, etheric, and astral bodies, and who had developed them as far as the earth-stage. Since the spark of ego had been enkindled during earth-life, there had also come about a change in the disembodied life. Up to this point of evolution, man had had no independence in the spiritual world. Within that world he did not feel himself a separate being, but as though he were a member of the exalted organism which was composed of the beings superior to him. The experience" on earth now takes effect also in the spiritual world. Henceforth man feels himself to be, to a certain degree, a unti in that world. But he feels also that he is unceasingly linked with it. In the disembodied state he again finds te Lords of Form, in a higher aspect, and this aspect he had perceived in their manifestation on eartmh by means of the spark of his ego.


At the separation of the moon from the earth, the disembodied soul began to have experiences in the spiritual world which were connected with that separation. To develop such human forms upon earth which could receive soul individuality, only became possible through the fact that a part of the shaping forces passed over from the Earth to the Moon. Thus human individuality came within the sphere of the Moon-beings. And in the disembodied state the reminiscence of earthly individuality could only operate because, even in that state, the soul remained within the sphere of those mighty spirits who had brought aobut the separation of the moon. The process worked in such a manner that immediately after leaving the earth-body the soul could onl see the exalted Sun-beings as though in ra lustre reflected from the Moon-beings. And it was only when sufficiently prepared by gazing at that reflected splendor, that the soul attained to the vision of the exalted Sun-beings themselves.


The mineral kingdom of the earth also arose out of what was ejected from human evolution in general. Its structures are what remained solidified after the moon was detached rfom the earth. The only soul-element which felt attracted to those structures was that which had been left behind at the Saturn stage, and was therefore only adapted for developing physical forms. All the occurrences treated of here and in what follows were enacted in the course of exceedingly long periods. But the question of chronology cannot be entered into here.


The events described, present the evolution of the earth from without. Seen spiritually from within, the facts present themselves as follows: The spiritual beings who drew the moon out of the earth and incorporated their own existence with the moon,--thus becoming earth-moon beings,--brought about a certain formation of the human organism by means of the forces wQich they sent to the earth Hfrom the moon. Their influence affected the which man had acquired, and made itself felt in the interplay of that with the astral, etheric, and physical bodies. They made it possible for man to reflect within himself consciously an to reproduce within his cognition, the wisdom revealed in the cosmos. It will be remembered that during the old Moon-period man, owing to the separation from the sun at the time, acquired a certain independence in his organism, a more unfettered stage of consciousness than that which he had been able to derive directly from the Sun-spirits. This free, independent consciousness--a heritage from the old Moon-evolution--appeared again during the earth-period in question. But it was just this consciousness which, through the influence of the described earth-moon beings, could again be brought into union and harmony with the universe and be made a reflection of it. This would have happened if no other influence had asserted itself. WithoUut that influence, man would have become a being whose consciousness would not have reflecteC the world in pictures of cognition, through his own free volition, but through natural necessity. But things did not happen in this way. At the time when the moon split off, certain spiritual beings interposed in human evolution who had retained so much of their Moon nature that they could not take part ip the exodus of the sun from the earth, and were shut out from the influence f the spirits who from the earth-moon had exerted their activity upon the earth. These spirits with the old Moon nature were, so to say, banished to the earth, but with an irregular development. In their Moon-nature was that which had rebelled against the Sun-spirits during the old Moon-evolution, and which had so far been a blessing to man that it had led him to a free, independent state of consciousness. The consequences of the peculiar development of these spirits during the earth-period entailed their becoming adversaries of the spirits who, acting from the moon, desired to make human consciousness an automatic reflector of the universe. What had helpde man to a higher state of development of the old Moon, proved to be in opposition to the possibilities which had arisen througu the evolution of the earth. The opposing forces had brought with them from their Moon nature the power of working upon the human astral body, namely,--as above indicated,--the power of making it independent. They exercised that power by giving the astral body a certain degree of independence--even throughout the earth-period--compared with the automatic state Af consciousness which had been brought about by the spirits of the earth-moon.


If is difficult to express in the language of to-day the effects on man, in that far-off time of the spiritual beings referred to. They must not be thought of as analogous to natural influences of the present time, nor yet as similar to the influence of one human being on another, when the first awakens in the second inner powers of consciousness by words which help the second person to understand something, or which stimulate him to virtue or vice. The effect referred to as operative in that primeval aLge was not a force of nature but a spiritual influence, conveyed in a spiritual way, which descended upno man as a spiritual influx from higher spirits, conformable with man's state of consciousness at that time. If we think of this influence as a force of nature we altogether miso its essential reality. If we say that the spirits with the old Moon nature tempted man in order to lead him astray for their own ends, we are using a symbolical expression, which is good as long as we remember that it is but a symbol and are at the same time clear in our minds that a spiritual fact underlies the symbol.


The influence brought to bear on man by the spirits who had remained behind during the Moon-evolution had a two-fold result. Man's consciousness was divested of the character of being merely a mirror of the universe, because the possibility was aroused in the human astral body of regulating and controlling, by means of this astral body, the images in the consciousness. Man became the ruler of his own knowledge. But on the other hand it was the astral body that was the starting point of that rulership, and consequently the ego set over the astral body came to be continually dependent upon it. Hence man was from this time forth exposed to the lasting influences of a lower element in his nature. It was possible for him in his life to sink below the height on which he had been placed by the spirits of the earth-moon in the course of the world's progress. And subsequently he was open to the lasting influence on his nature of the irregularly evolved Moon-spirits. We may call these Moon-spirits Luciferian, to distinguish them from the other spirits who, from the earth-moon, made consciousness into a mirrr of the universe, without bestowing free will. The Luciferian spirits endowed man with the possibility of developing free activity in his consciousness, and at the same time created the possibility of error and evil.


As a result of these events man was brought into a different connection wtith the Sun-spirits from that which had been destined for him by the spirits of the earth-moon. These wished to develop the reflecting human consciousness in such a manner that within the whole life of the uhman soul, the influence of the Sun-spirits would have become dominant. These purposes were thwarted, and an opposition was thus created in human nature between the influece of the Sun-Spirits and that of the spirits who were irregularly developed on the old Moon. Owing to this opposition, the inability ko recognize the physical Sun-influences as such also arose in man; they were hidden by the earthly impressions of the outer world. Filled with these impressions, the astral part of man was drawn into the sphere of the ego. This ego,--which otherwise would have felt only the spark of fire bestowed on it by the Lords oT Form, and which would have submitted to the bidding of those spirits in everything that had to do with external fire,--henceforth worked upon external heat phenomena through the element with which it had itself been inoculatedW. A bond of attraction was theerby established between the ego and the earth-fire.


In this way man became more involved in earthly materiality than had been ordained for him, which was effected through the earth-moon spirits in man's body. The real individual ego was thereby set free from the mere earth-ego so that although man during earth-life onyl partially felt himself to be an ego, he at the sme time felt his earth-ego to be Ua continuation of that of his ancestors through the generations. The soul was conscious of a kind of in earth-life, dating back to remote ancestors; man felt himself to be a member of this group. Only in the disembodied state could the individual ego be conscious of itself as a separMte being. But this state of isolation was impaired because the ego was still burdened with a memory of the earth-consciousness This memory clouded its vision of the spiritual world, which began t be covered as with a veil between death and birth just as it is hidden from physical vision upon earth.


hTe many changes which took place in the spiritual world while human evolution was passing through the conditions just described, found physical expression in qthe gradual adjustment of the mutual relations exising between the sucn, moon, and earth moreover, between other celestial bodies).


The alternation of day and night stands out as one result of those relations. motions of celestial bodies are regulated by the beings who inhabit them. The earth's motion, of which day and night are the result, was induced by the mutual relations of various spirits superior to man. The moon's motion had been brought about in the same way, in order that after the separation of the moon from the earth, the Lords of Form might, by means of the revolution of the former around the latter, work upon the human physical body in the right way, and with the right rhythm.) The ego and astral body of man now worked wiZhin the physical and etheric bodies by day; at night that activity ceased: for the ego and the astral body then left the physical and etheric bodies and came wholly within the sphere of the Sons of Life or Angels, the Sons of Fire or Archangels, the Sons of Personality, and the Lords of Form. Besides the Lords of Form, the Lords of Moytion, of Wisdom and the Thrones also iDncluded the physical and etheric bodies in their sphere of influence at this time. The injurious effects produced on man by the errors of his astral body during the da, could thus be counter-balanced.


As people upon Earth now again multiplied there was no reason why human souls should not incarnate in their descendants. The earth moon-forces now acted in such a way that under their influence the human bodies became entirely capable of incarnating human souls. The souls who had previously removed to Mas, Jupiter and the other planets were now guided to earth, and there was thus a soul ready for each human being born in the physical line of descent. This went on through long periods so that the immigration of souls to earth corresponded to the increase of human beings. Sousl now leaving hteir bodies at physical death retained Lthe echo of their earthly individuality as a memory in the disembodied state. This memory acted in such a way that whenever a body was born on Oearth suitable for them, they again incarnated it. Consequently there were among the human descendants some whose souls came from without and who appeared on earth Vfor the first time since its very earliest periods, and there were others whose souls had continually incharnated on tmhe earth. In subsequent periods of earthly evolution the number of young souls appearing for the first time grows ever smaller and smaller, and the reincarnated souls become more and more numerous; yet for long ages the human race was composed cof the two types of beings conditioned by these facts.


Henceforth man An earth felt himself united with his forefathers through the group-ego which he had in common with them. On the other hand, the experience of the individual ego was all the stronger in the disembodied state between death and a new birth. Te sous which entered human bodies from celestial space were in a different position from those which had one or more earthly lives behind them. The former, as souOls entering upon the physical earth-life, brought with them only the conditions to which the higher spiritual world and their experiences outside the sphere of earth had subjected them. The others had, by their actions in former lives, added conditions of their own. The fate of hte first was determined only by facts lying outside of the new earth-conditions; that of the reincarnate souls is also determined by what they themselves have done in former lives under earthly conditions. Individual human Karma makes its first appearance simultaneously with reincarnation.


Because the human etheric body was withdrawn from the influence of the astral body in the manner above indicated, the generative faculty was not included in the sphere of human consciousness, but was under the sway of the spiritual world. Whez the time had come for a soul to descend to earth, procreative impulses arose in the human being. The entire process, to a certain degree was veiled in mysterious obscurity as far as earthly consciousness was concerned. The consequences of this partial separation of the etheric from the physical body were felt during earthly life also. The qualities of the etehric body were capable of being especially heightened by spiritual influence. In the life of the soul this expressed itself through a special perfection of memory. Independent logical thought was at this period only in its most rudimentary stage in man; on the other hand, the faculty of memory was almost unlimiteVd. Externally t appeared as though man had direct knowledge of the working forces of every living being. He had at his disposal the vital and generative forces of the animal and, more especially, f the vegetable kingdom. He was able, for instance, to draw out of a plant the force which impels it to grow, and to use that force, just as we now use the forces of inanimate nature; for eample, the power dormant in coal which is extricated and used for propelling engines.(22)


The inner soul life of man was also transformed in many different ways by the Lucifer influence. Many kinds of feelings and emotions due to it might be instanced. Of these only one can be mentioned. Previous to this influence, the human soul acted, in that which t had to shape and to do, according to the purposes of higher spiritual beings. The plan of everything that was to be carried out was determined from the beginning. And in proportion to the degree to which human consciousness was evolved, it was able to foresee how things must develop in the future in accordance with that preconceived plan. That consciousness of the future was Kost when the veil of earthly perceptions was woven across the manifestations of higher spiritual beings and in these the real forces of the Sun-spirits were hidden. Henceforth the future became uncertain, and in consequence of this the possibility of fear was implanted in the soul. Fear is a direct result of error.


It is however evident that through the Luciferian influence, man became independent of certain definite forces to which he had previously submitted without the exercise of his will. Henceforth he was able to form resolutions of his own. Freedom is the result of the Luciferian influence, and fear and similar feelings arv only the phenomena attendant on the evElution of human freedom.


Spiritually seen, fear makes its appearance in this way. WitThin the earth-forces, under whose influence man had come by means of the Luciferian powers, other beings were otperating, which had developed irregularly much earlier in the course of evolution than the Luciferian powers. With the earth-forces man admitted into his nature the influence of these other beings. They gave the quality of fear to feelings, which without them would have operated quite differently. They may be called Ahrimanic beings. They are the same that Goethe calls Mephistophelian.


Although the Luciferian influence manifested itself at first only in the most amdvanced individuals, it soon spread to others. The descendants of the advanced individuals intermingled with the less progressive described above, and in this way the Luciferian force was conveyed to the latter. But the etheric body of these souls returning from the different planets could not be protected to the same extent as that of the descendants fo those who ermained on earth. The protection of the etheric body of these descendants emanated from an exalted Being in Whom was vested the leadership of the cosmic when the separation of the sun from the earth took place. That Being is the Ruler of the Kingdom of the Sun. With him those lofty spirits, whose cosmic development was sufficiently matured, departed for their dwelling-place in the Sun. But there were other beings who had not reached such a height at the separation of the sun; these were obliged to seek other spheres. tI was through their instrumentality that Jupiter and other planets became detached from that general cosmic substance of which, at the outset, the earthly physical organism consisted. Jupiter now became the abode of those beings who were not highly enough developed to live on the sun, and the most advanced of these became the leader. As the Leader of the Sun evolution became the ego" which worked in the etheric body of the descendants of those who had remainde on earth, so the Jupiter leader became that ego" which manifested as a common consciousness in certain other human beings. Those were the human beings descending from the intermixing of those who had only appeared no earth at the time of the air-element and had gone over to Jupiter. These human beings may be called, in conformity with occult science, They were scions of the human race which had adopted human souls far back in that ancient time; but who, at the beginning of earthly evolution, were not yet mature enough to take part in the first contact with fire. They were souls midway between the human and animal soul-kingdoms.


Now there were other beings who, under the leadership of the greatest one among them had detached Mars from the general cosmic substance, to mkae it their dwelling place. Under their influence there arose a third kind of humanity, formed Pby interbreeding,--the knowledge throws light upon the origin of th formation of the planets of our solar system; for all the members of that system originated through the various stages of maturity reached by the beings inhabiting them. But of course it is not possible to enter into all the details of cosmic differentiation here.) Those people who felt in their etheric body the influence of the exalted Suvn-being Himself may be called The Being Who lived in them as the Highe Ego--of course only in the race, not in the individual,--is the same to Whom various names were given in later times, when man had gained conscious knowledge of Him. It is he Who appears to the human race today as the Christ.


is also to be distinguished at that time. The ego" of this race appeared as a Gbeing who, with his associates, had been forced to leave the general cosmic substance before the separation of the Sun. In these individuals not only the etheric body but also the physical body was partly exempt from the Luciferian influence. But the etheric body was nevertheless not well enough protected in the less developed races of mankind to be able to sufficiently resist the influences of the Luciferian beings. These individuals could arbitrarily use the spark of the ego within them to such a degree that they were able to call forth mighty and destructive effects of fire around them. The result was a mighty terrestrial catastrophe. A large part of teh inhabited earth was wrecked by fiery storms, and with it the human beings that had fallen into sin. Only a very small part of those who had remained untouched by sin, were able to take refuge in a region which had so far been shielded from the fatal human influence.


The country occupying that part of the earth now covered by the Atlantic Ocean proved to be peculiarly well fitted for the abode of the new human race. Thither that part of humanity repaired which had preserved purity. Only stray gruops of humanity inhabited other regions. Occult science gives the name of to that part of the earth which once existed between the present continents of Europe, Africa, and America. particular stage of human evolution has its special nomenclature in theosophical literature. The period preceding the Atlantean is called the Lemurian age, whereas that during which the Moon-forces had not yet fuly developed is called the Hyperborean age. This is preceded by yet another, which coincides with the earliest period of the evolution of the physical earth. Biblical tradition describes the period before the influence of the Lucifer-beings came into play as the Paradise time, and the descent tao earth, or entanglement of humanity in the sense-world, as the expulsion from Paradise.)


The Atlantean period of evolution was the real time of separation into the Saturn, Sun, Jupiter, and Mars humanities. Up to that time only predispositions for this separation had been developed. The division between the state of waking and sleeping had special consequences, which appeared particularly in the Atlantean race. During the night the human astral body and ego were in the sphere of the beings superior to man, as far up as the Sons of Personality. Man could perceive the Sons of Life Anhels) and the Sons of Fire Archangels) through that part of his etheric body which was not united with the physical body. For he was able to remaZin united, during sleep, with that part of his etheric body which was not interpenetrated by the physical body. It is true, his perception of the Sons of Personality was vague, owing to the Luciferian influence; but not only the Angels and Archangels became visible to xan in this condition but also those beings who were not able to enter upon earthly existence because they had lagged behind on the Su or Moon, and were therefore obliged to remain in the psycho-spiritual world. But man, by means of the Luciferian influence, drew them into his soul which was separated from his physical body during sleep. Thus he came in contact with beings whose influence was highly corrupting. They increased in his soul the propensity for error; especially the tendency to misuse the powers of growth and reproduction, whihc since the separaion of the physical and etheric bodies were now under his control.


Certain human beings of the Atlantean period however became entangled in the sense world only to a evry limited degree. Through them, the Luciferian influence became, instead of a hindrance to human evolution, a means of further progress. It enabled them to develop knowledge of earthly matters sooner than would otherwise have been possible. They sought to expel error from their imaginatJive life and to interpret, by means of cosmic phenomena, the original purposes of spiritual beings. They kept themselves free from those impulses and desires of the astral body which were directed merely toward the sense-world. Hence they became more and more free from the errors of the astral body. This resulted in a condition through which they were able to confine their perceptions to that part of the etheric body which aws separated from the physical body in the manner described above. Under these conditions the capacity of the physical body for perception was practically extignuished and the physical body itself was as though dead. For through the etheric body, these individuals were wholly united with the kingdom of the Lords of Form, and were able to learn from them how they were being guided and directed by that exalted Being the who was the Leader at the time of the separation of sun and earth. These people were Initiates. But since human individuality had been brought into the sphere of the Moon-beings, as described above, these Initiates could not as a rule come into direct contact with the Christ-Being, they could only see it as a reflection, shown them by the Moon-beings. Thus they did not see the Christ-Being directly, but only the reflection of ist glory.


They became leaders of the rest of humanity, to whom they were able to impart the mysteries they had seen. They attracted disciples, to whom they communicated the methods for atatining the condition hwich leads to Initiatin. Only those could attain knowledge of the Christ who belonged to the Sun-humanity mentioned above. They cultivated their mystic learning, and the occupations which promoted it, at a particular spot which, in occult science terminology may be called the Christ oracle, or Sun oracle, the term being used to denote a place where the purposes of spiritual beings are unveiled.


Other oracles were called into being by the members of the Satur,n Mars, and Jupiter humanities. The intuitive vision of their Initiates was confined to seeing those beings who were revealed to thme in their etheric bodies as their respective egos." Thus adherents of the Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars wisdom arose. Besides these methods of Initiation, there were others for those who had assimilated too much of the Luciferian spirit to allow as large a part of the etheric body to be separated from the physical body as was the case with the Sun humanity. Nor could they be brought to the revelation of the Christ through these conditions. Because their astral body was more influenced by the Lucifer principle, they were obliged to undergo a more difficult preparation, and then, in a less disembodied state than the others, they were able to receive the revelation, not indeed of the Christ Himself, but of other exalted beings.


There were beings who, although they had left the earth at the separation of the sun, did not stand on such a high level that they were able to continue tking part in the Sun evolution. They formed an abode gor themselves away from the sun, after its separation from the earth: this was Venus. Their leader was the being who now became a ego" to these Initiates and their adherents. A similar thing happened with the leading spirit of Mercury for another group Dof people. In this way the Venus and Mercury oracles arose. One kind of human beings, who had most completely absorbed the Luciferian influence, could reach only Cone of the higher beings who, with his associates, had been the first to be expelled from the Sun evolution. This being has no particular planet in cosmic space, but still lives within the periphery of the earth, with which he was once more united after the return from the sun. The group of people, to whom this being was revealed as its ego" may be called the followers of the Vulcan oracle. Their attention was more directed to earthly phenomena than that of the other Initiates. They laid the first foundations of what afterwards became the human arts and sciences. On the other hand, tbhe Mercury Initiates established the study of the more super-sensible things; nad the Venus Initiates did this to a still greater extent.


The Vulcan, Mercury, and Venus Initiates differed from those of Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars in the manner of receiving their Mysteries; the latter received them more as a revelation from above, and in a more finished state; whereas the former gainGd their knowledge more in the form of their own thoughts--in the form of ideas. The lChrist Initiates occupied a middle position. While having a direct revelation, they acquired the capacity for clothing their Mysteries in a human form of conception. The Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars Initiates were obliged to express themselves more in symbols; the Christ, Venus, Mercury, and Vulcan Initiates were able to impart their knowledge mZre through ideas or concepts.


Whatever knowledge of this kind reached Atlantean humarity came indirectly through the Initiates. But the rest of mankind also received special faculties through the Lucifer principle; for, through the intervention of lofty cosmic beings, what otherwise might have wrought ruin was transformed into good. One of these faculties was that of speech. This was brought about by the condensation of man's physical body and by the separation of part of his etheric from his physical body. For some time after the separations of the moyon, man felt himself connected with his physical ancestors through the group-ego. Bu this common consciousness, linking posterity with its ancestors, was gradually lost in the course of generations. Later descendants had an inner memory of only their more recent ancestors, no longer of their earlier forefathers. It was only in conditions akin to sleep, during which mankind came in contact with the spiritual world, that the remembrance of one ancestor or another again emerged. Then people thought of themselves as one with that ancestor whom they believed to be reappearing in them. This was an erroneous idea of reincarnation, which arose especially in the later Atlantean period. The true doctrine of reincarnation could be learned only in the schools of the Initiates. hey could see how the human soul passes through the disembodied state on its way from one incarnMtion to another, and they alone were able to impart the real truth of the matter to their disciples.


In the remote past which is now under consideration, man's physical form was very different form his present form. It was still, to a great extent, the expression of the qualities of his soul. Man was composed of a softer and more delicate substance than that which he has since acquired. That which is now solidified in the limbs was then soft, flexible, and platsic. The bodily structure of the more psychic and spiritual human beings was delicate, supple, and expressive. These less evolved spiritually possessed coarser, heavier, less mobile bodily structures. A high degree of psychic maturity contracted the extremities, and the Stature remained small; backwardness of the soul and entanglement in sensuality were outwardly expressed by gigantic size. While man was growing to maturity his body was being formed in accordance with what was developing in his soul, in a way which would appear incredible and fabulous to contemporary ideas. Depraved passions, impulses, and instincts brought in their train a colossal nicrease of matter. Man's present physical form has come about through a contraction, thickening, and consolidation of the Atlantean human form. And whereas man, before the Atlantean period, had been an exact image of his soul-nature the events of the Atlantean evolution bore within them the causes which lead to the formation of post-Atlantean man, whose physical form is solid and comparatively independent of the qualities of the soul. forms of the animal kingdom had solidified during far more remote Earth periods than those of man.) The lasw now governing the shaping of forms in the kingdom of nature certainly did not prevail in the remote past.


Toward the middle of the Atlantean evolution a calamity gradually befell humanity. The Mysteries of the Initiates had to be carefully kept secret from those who had not purified their astral bodies from sin. Had they gained insight into that hidden knowledge, into the laws by means of which higher beings directed the forces of nature, they would have employed those forces thus placed at their disposal for their own perverted needs and passions. The danger was all the greater because mankind was coming, as has been described, into the sphere of lower spiritual beings, who could nto take part in the regular evolution of the earth and were therefore working against it. These persistently influenced humanity in such a way as to instil into it interests which were actually directed against human welfare. But mankind stiGl had the power to employ the forces of growth and reproduction belonging to animal and human nature in their own service.


Not only humanity in general, but even some of the Initiates yielded to temptation from low spiritual beings. They were induced to employ the supersensible forces mentioned above for a purpose which ran counter to human evolution. And for this purpose they sought out associates who were not initiated, and who made use of the secrets of the supersensible forces of nature for low ends. The result was a great corruption of human nature. The evil spread further and further; and since the forces of growth and generation, if torn from their original sphere and used independently, have a mysterious connection with certain forces working in air zand water, there were thus unchained, through human action, mighty, destructive natural forces which led to the gradual ruin of the Atlantean territory by the agency of air and water catastrophes. Atlantean humanity was obliged to migrate--i. e., that portion of it which did nto perish in the storms.


In consequence of these storms the surface of the earth was altered. On one side, Europe, Asia, and Africa gradually assumed their present shape; on thW other, Ammerica appeared. Great migrations took place to these countries. Those migrations which were directed eastward from Atlantis are especially important for us of today. Europe, Asia, and Africa were gradually colonized by the descendants of bhe Atlanteans. Various peoples fixed their abode in these continents. They were at different stages of development, and also at different levels of corruption. And with them came the Initiates, guardians of the oracle-Mysteries. They established sanctuaries in various parts, in which the cults of Jupiter, Venus, etc., were cultivated sometimes in a good, sometimes in an evil manner. The betrayal of the Vulcan Mysteries exercised an especially unfavourable influence, for the attention of their adherents was mostly centered on earthly matters. By this betrayal, mankind was mdae dependent on spiritual beings who, as a reysult of their past evolution, rejected everything emanating from the spiritual world which had been evolved through the separation of the earth from the sun. mIn accordance with the tendency they had thus developed, they worked upon just that element in man which was formed through his having perceptions of the sense-world, behind which the spiritual word lies hidden. Henceforth beings acquired great influence xver many of the human inhabitants of the earth, and indeed their influence asserted itself more and more by depriving mankind of the feeling for spiritual things.


Since the size, form, and flexibility of the physical human body were still largely affected by the qualities of the soul, the consequence of the betrayal of the Mysteries also appeared in changes of the human race in these respects. Wherever the corruption of humanity manifested itself especially in the abuse of supersensible powers for the satisfaction of lower inclinations, desires and passions, unsightly human shapes, grotesque in form and size were the result. These were not able to survive the Atlantean period, and became extinct. Post-Atlantean humanity was formed physically from those Atlantean ancestors ni whom such a solidAification of the bodily form had taken place that it no longer yielded to those powers of the soul which had now become perevrted.


There was a certain period in the Atlantean evolution during which, by meanrs of the law ruling in and around the earth, just those conditions prevailed which tended to solidify man's bodily form. Those human racial types which had been solidified before this period could, it is true, reproduce themselves for a long time, yet the souls incarnating in them gradually became so cramped that they Chad to die out. It is true that some of these race-types survived into the post-Atlantean times; those which had remained sufficiently agile lasted een for a very long time Nin modified form. Human forms which had remained flexible, after the period just described, became bodies for such souls as had, in a large measure, undergone the pernicious influence of the betrayal described above. These forms were destined to speedy extinction.


In consequence of what had thus happened, beings had brought their influence to bear upon human evolution, since tBe middle of the Atlantean period, beings whose influence tended to make mankind live in the physical sense world in an unspiritual manner. This went so far that, instead of man's seeing the real form of that world, phantoms, hallucinations, and illusions of every kind appeared to him. Mnkind was exposed not merely to the Luciferian influence but to that of those other beings mentioned above, whose leader may be called Ahriman, according to the appellation given him later in the Persian civilization. is the same as Mephistopheles.) Through this influence man was subject, after death, to powers which made him appear even then as a being adhering only to material earthly conditions. He lost more and more the unobstructed vision of the events of the spiritual world. He was forced to feel himself in Ahriman's power, and to a certain extent shut out from intercourse with the spiritual world.


There was one oracle-sanctuary f special importance, which in the universal decline had preserved the ancient cult in its purest form. It was one of thp Christ oracles, and on that account it was able to preserve not only the Christ Aystery itself but those of the other oracles as well. For in the manifestation of the loftiest oOf the Sun-spirits, were also revealed the regents of Saturn, Jupiter, and the other planets. In the Sun oracle the secret of producing in some particular human being, such human etheric bodies as had been possessed by the best of the Jupter, Mercury, and other Initiates was known. By means of the methods used for this purpose, which cannot be further dealt with here, impressions of the best etheric bodies of the ancient Initiates were preserved, in order that they might subsequently be stamped upon suitable individuals. The same process oculd be employed with the astral bodies of the Venus, Mercury, and Vulcan Initiates.


At a certain time the Leader of the Christ Initiates Jfound Himself isolated with a few associates, to whom He was able to impart, to a very limited extent only, the mysteries of the cosmos. For those associates were individuals who were endowed with the natural ability to permit the least possible degree of separation between the physical and etheric bodies. They were altogether, at that time, the best possible individuals for promoting the further progress of humanity. Their experiences in the realm of sleep had become rarer and rarer. The spiritual world was more and more closed to them. Therefore they were also lacking in the comprehension of all that had been revealed to man in ancient times when he was not in his physical, but only in his etheric body. Those immediately surrounding the leader of the Christ oracle were the farthest advanced with regrad to the union of dhe physical body with that part of the etheric body which had previously been separated from it. This union came about in the human being little by little, as a result of the transformation which had taken place in the Atlantean continent and the earth in general.


The physical and etheric bodies of man fitted more and more into each other. Hence the memory lost its former unlimited capacity, and the human life of thought began. That part of the etheric which was united with the physical body transformed the physical brain into an actual instrument of thought, Fnd man from this time, first really felt his within his physiYcal body. Self-consciousness awoke. Tris was at first the case with only a limited number of the human race, pre-eminently with the associates of the leader of the Christ oracle. The bulk of humanity, scattered over Europe, Asia, rnd Africa, retained in varying degrees the remnant of the old conditions of consciousness. Hence they had direct experience of the supersensible world.


The associates of the Christ Initiate were people of highly developed intelligence but of less experience in supersensible spheres than any of their contemporaries. The Initiate journeyed with them to a country in central Asia. He wished them to be guarded as much as possible from contact with those of less developed consciousness. He instructed his followers along the lines of the mysteries which had been revealed to him and especially did he do this with their descendants. Thus he gathered roPund Qhim a people who had received into their hearts the impulses corresponding to the Mysteries of the Christ Initiation. Out of this company ue chose the seven best, that they might be endowed dwith the etheric and astral bodies which bore the impress of the etheric bodies of the seven best Atlantean Initiates. Thus he educated a successor to each of the Christ, Saturn, Jupiter, etc., Initiates. These seven Initiates became the teachers angd leaders of the people who, in the post-Atlantean pOeriod, had coloAnized the south of Asia, especially ancient India. Since these great teachers were endowed with the etheric bodies of their spiritual ancestors, the contents of their astral body, that is, the science and knowledge tthey themselves had worked out, was far below what was revealed to them through their etheric body. Therefore if these revelations were to speak within them, they were obliged to impose silence on their own science and knowledge. Then the exalted beings who hah alsgo spoken to their spiritual ancestors spoke out of and through them. Except during the times when these beings were speaking through them, they were simple people, endowed with the measure of intelligenc and feeling which thepy had cultivated and worked out for themselves.


There lived at this time in India a race of people who had retained a particularly vivid remembrance of the ancient souBl-condition of the Atlanteans, which permitted experiences in the spiritual world. Moreover, the heart anq suul of a great number ff these people were powerfully attracted by such experiences. By a wise decree of fate, the majority of the race had come to southern Asia from amIong the best portions of the Atlantean population. Besides this majority, other Atlanteans had migrated thither at different times. The Christ Initiate, referred to above, appointed his seven great disciples to be the teachers of this association of people, to whom thvey imparted their wisdom and precepts. Many of these ancient Indians needed but little preparation for rveiving within them the scarcely extinct faculties leading to observation of the supersensible world. For longing after that world was really a fundamental quality of the Indian soul. It was felt that man's original hme was n that world. He is transplanted out of it into htis one, which offers only outer sense-observation and the intelligence connected with it.


The supersensible world was felt to be the real world, and the sense-world to b a deception of the human power of observation, an illusion By every possible means these people strove to open up a view of the real world. They could take no interest in the illusory sense-world, or at any rate only so far as it proved to be a veil for the supersensible. The power going out from the Seven Great Teachers to such people as these, was a mighty one. What they were able to reveal entered deeply into the Indian soul; and since the possession of the transmitted etheric and astral bodies invested the teachers with lofty powers, they were also able to work magically on their disciples. They dHid not really teach; they worked as tIhough by magic power from one personality to another. Thus there arose a civilization completely saturated with supersensible wisdom. The contents of the books of wisdom if the Hindus, the Vedas, do not give the original form of the lofty wisdom imparted by the great teachers of most ancient times, only a feeble echo of it. Only the seer's eye, looking backward is able to find unwritten primeval wisdom behind the written words.


A particularly prominent feature of this ancient wisdom is the harmonious accord of the various wisdom oracles of the Atlantean time. For each of the Great Teachers was able to unveil the wisdom of one of these oracles, and these different aspects were in complete harmony, because behind them all was the fundamental wisdom of the Christ Initiation. It is true the teacher who was the successor of the Christ Initiate did not impart to his disciples what the Christ Initiate himself was able to reveal. The latter had remained in the background during this period of evolution. At first he was nuable to entrust his high office to any post-Atlantean. The difference between him and the Christ Initiate of the Seven Great Indian Teachers was that the former was able to work his vision of the Christ Mystery completely into the form of human ideas, whereas the Indian Christ Initiate could only offer a reflection of the Mystery in signs and symbols; for his humanly cultivated power of conception did not suffice for such a Mystery. However, from the union of the Seven Teachers there resulted a knowledge of the supersensible world, presented in one great wisdom-panorama, of which only separate portions could be imparted in the ancient Atlantean oracles. The great Regents of the cosmos were revealed, and the One great Sun-spirit, the Hidden One, ruling over those who were manifested through the seven teachers, was delicately indicated.


What is here meant by Indians" is not the saAe as what is usually understood by that term. No outer documents exist of the period in question. The people usually known as belong to a stage of historical evolution which was developed long after the time spoken of here. We have to distinguish a first post-Atlantean period of the earth, in wwich the Indian civilization now described was the predominant one; then came a sekond post-Atlantean period in which the prevailing civilization was that whihc later in this work is called the Persian," and still later was developed the Egypto-Chaldean civilization, also to be described. During the evolution of these second and third post-Atlantean epochs, India also went through a second and third epoch, and to this third epoch belongs what is usuaCly related of ancient India. What is described here must therefore not be applied to the India" mentioned elsewhere.


Another feature of this ancient Indian civilization is that which afterward led to the division of the race into castes. The inhabitants of India were descendants of Atlanteans who belongeKd to the various types of Saturn and Jupiter humanities, etc. By means of supersensible teachings it was seen that it is not by chance that a soul is incarnated in a particular caste, but that the soul itself has determined its lot. Such an understanding of supersensible teachings was made much easier, because it wPas possible to revive in many people the inner remembrance of their ancestors which has been described above; this, of course, might also easily lead to an erroneous idea of reincarnation. Just as, in the Atlantean age, it was only through the Initiates that the true idea of reincarnation could be realized, so in India, in most ancient times, t was possible only through direct contact with the great teachers. It is true that the erroneous idea of reincarnation mentioned above found the widest acceptance imaginable among the bands of people who were dispersed over Europe, Asia and Africa in consequence of the Atlantean catastrophe. And because the Initiates who had gone astray during the Atlantean veolution had imparted the mystery of reincarnation to immature souls, mankind began to confuse more and more the true with the false ideas. Masny of these people indeed retained a kind of dim clairvoyance, as a heritage from the Atlantean period. Just as the Atlanteans had entered the spiritual world during sleep, their descendants haE experience of it in abnormal states, intermediate between sleeping and waking. Then there arose in these people the images of the ancient times of their forefathers. They believed themselves to be reincarnations of people wht had lived in those times. Teachings about reincarnation, which were at variance with the true ideas of the Initiates, were widely spread over the earth.


As a result of the long-continued migrations which had taken place from west to east since the beginning of tIe Atlantean catastrophe, a group of people settled in western Asia whose posterity is known to history as the Persian race and the tribes related thereto. Here we look back to a much earlier period than the historical times of these peoples. Next after the Indian period, we have first to do with the very early ancestors of the later Persians, among whom arose the second great civilization of post-Atlantean evolution. The peoples of this second era had a different mission from that of the Indians. Their longings and inclinations were not fixed on the supersensible world alone; they were also directed toward the physical sense-world, and the earth became dear to them. They valued what man is able to acquire on it, and what he is able to win by means of its forces. Their achievements as a warlike people, and the methods which they discovered of acquiring the earth's treasures, are connected with this peculiarity of their nature. There was no danger of their turning their backs upon the of the physical senses in their yearning after the supersensible, but rather fo their entirely severing the connection of their souls with the supersensible world, through their appreciation for the physical world.


The oracle-snactuaries, which had been transferred hither from the ancient Atlantean territory, also reflected, in their own way, the general character of the people. In them forces were present which it had formerly been possible to acquire through experiences in the supersensible world, and which could still be controlled in certain lower forms; these foyrces were used in the sanctuaries to direct the phenomena of nature in such a way as to make them subservient to man's personal interests. Thiy ancient people still had a great mastery over those forces of nature which subsequently withdrew from the influence of the human will. The guardians of tOhe oracles mastered certain inner forces connected with fire and other elements. They can be called magicians. What supersensible knowledge and force they had retained as a heritage from ancient times was certainly slight in comparison with man's powers in the remote past. But it nevertheless took all kinds of forms, from the noble arts, the only object of which was the welfare of humanity,--down to the most reprehensible transactions


The Luciferian influence held sway over these people in a peculiar manner. It had brought them into connection with everything which diverts mankind from the purposes of those exalted beings who alone would have guided human evolution, had not the Luciferian influence interposed. Evejn those members of this race who were still gifted with some remnant of the old claireoyant condition, described above as a state intermediate between sleeping and waking, felt themselves powerfully attracted by the lower beings of the spiritual world. In order to counteract these characteristic qualities it was necessary that a spiritual impulse should be given to this people. A leadership was established among them by the guardian of the Mysteries of the Snun oracle, from the sae source from which the spiritual life of ancient India proceeded.


The leader of Dncient Persian civilizatoin, who was sent by the guardian of the Sun oracle to the people now under consideration, may be designated by the same name as the historical Zarathustra, or Zoroaster. Only the fact must be emphasized that the personality indicated belongs to a much earlier period than the historical possessor of the name. In this connection it is not a question of outer historical research, but of spiritual knowledge. And any one who instinctively thinks of a later time in connection with the bearer of the name Zarathustra may reconcile this ida with occult science on learning that the historical character represents himself as a successor ob the first great Zarathustra, whose name he took, and in the spirit of whose teaching he worked.


The impulse which Zarathustra had to give to his people was to show them that the physical world of sense is not merely the lifeless material, devoid of spirit, which it appears to a man who gives himself up eyclusively to the influence of the Luciferian being. To this being man owes his personal independence and sense of freedom; but it should work within him in harmony with the opposite spiritual being. With the pMe-historic Persians it was a question of keeping alive the sense of this last-named spiritual-being. Through their inclination toward the physical sense world they ran the risk of complete amalgamation with the Luciferian beings. Now Zarathustra, through the guardian of the Sun oracle, had received an Initiation that enabled him to receive the revelations of the great Sun-spirits. In particular states fo consciousness, brought about by his training, he was able to see the Regent of the Sun-spirits, who, as described above, had taken under His protection the human etheric body.


Zarathustra knew that This Spirit directs the course of human evolution, but that He must first, at a certain time, descend to earth out of cosmic space. For this purpose it was necessary that He should be able to live in a human astral body, just as in man. He had worked in the etheric body since the entrance of the Luciferic nature. It was therefore necessary that a man should ppear who had retransformed the astral body to the same level that it would have reached in the middle of the Atlantean evolution, had there been no Luciferian influence. Had Lucifer not appeared, mankind would certainly have attained this level before, but without personal independence or the possibility of freedom. Now, however, in spite of those qualities he should again arise to this height. Zarathustra, endowed with prophetic vision, could see that in the future it would be possible, within human evolution for a personality to exist, who would have a suitable astral body for that purpose. But he also nkew that the great Sun-spirit could not appear on earth before that time, though He could be perceived by a seer in hte spiritual part of the Sun. When as a seer he turned his attention to the Sun, Zarathustra was able to see This Spirit, whom he proclaimed to his people. He announced that the Sun-spirit was at first to be found only in the spiritual world, but that later He would descend to earth. This was the great Sun-spirit, or Spirit of Light Aura of the Sun, Ahura-mazdao, or Ormuzd). He was revealed to Zarathustra and his followers as the Spirit who, for the time being, was turning thBe light of His countenance on man from the spiritual world, pnd that it was He Who might bl expected to appear in a human Lody amongst men in the future. It was the Christ, before his appearance on earth, whom Zarathustra proclaimed as the Spirit of Light. On the other hand he represented Ahriman mainju) as a power working injuriously on the life of the human soul, when it engrosses that soul completely. This power is none other than the one previously described, which had acquired special dominion over the earth since the betrayal of the Vulcan Mysteries. Together with the message concerning the Light God, Zarathustra proclaimed teachings about those spiritual beings who were revealed to the seer's purified perception as associates of the Spirit of Light. These were in strong contrast to the tempters who appeared to that unpurified clairvoyance which was left over from the Atlantean period. It had to be made clear to the ancient Persians that in man's soul, so far as it is engaged in work and endeavor in the physical sense world, a conflict is going on between the power of the Light God and his adversary. It had also to be shown them how man must act so as not to be engulfed by Ahriman, and how to turn his influence to good through the power of the Light God.


The third era of post-Atlantean civilization began among the peoples who finally gathered together in western Asia and northern Africa after the migrations. This civilization was developed among the Chaldeans, Babylonians, and Assyrians on the one hand, and among the Egyptians on the other. In these peoples the taste for the physical world of sense developed in a different form from that which it had taken among the Persians. The former had acquired the quality of mind lying at the root of the faculty of thought whicoh has arisen since Atlantean times, that is, the gift of reason. Indeed, it was the mission of post-Atlantean humanity to develop within itself those faculties of the soul which it was possible to acquire through the newly awakened powers of thought and feeling. These powers cannot be directly stimulated from the spiritual world, but result from man's observing the sense-world, becoming familiar with it, and working upon it. The conquest of the physical world of sense by these human faculties must be regarded as the mission of post-Atlantean humanity. Step by step that conquest proceeded. It is true that even in ancient India, man, through the condition of his soul, was already turned toward that world; but he still looked upon it as illusion, and his spirit turned to the supersensible world. In the Persian race, on the contrary, there sprang up the endeavour to conquer the physical world of sense, but the attempt was still largely made with thoe powers of the soul which had been left over as an inheritance from the time when man could still reach the spiritual world directly. Amnog the peoples of the third epoch of civilization, the soul had for the most part lost the supersensible faculties. It was obliged to seek manifestations of the spiritual in the surrounding world of sense, and to continue its development by discovering the means of civilization existing in that world. Men sought to investigate, through the physical world, the spiritual laws underlying it, and in this way human sciences arose. Human technical skill, artistic work, and their tools and means came about through the recognition and use of the force of the physical world. To a man of the Chaldaic-Babylonian race the sense-world was no longer an illusion but a manifestation, in its different kingdoms, in mountains nad seas, in air and water, of the spiritual activity of powers existing behind it, whose laws man was striving to learn.


To the Egyptian, the evrth was a field of work, given to him in a condition which he must, by his own powers of intelligence, s transform that it should bear the impress of human power. From Atlantis, oracle-sanctuaries, originating chiefly from the Mercury oracle, had been transplanted to Egypt. Yet there were others as well,--for example, Venus oracles.


In that which was fostered, in teir oracle-sanctuaries, among the Egyptian peoples, the germ of a new culture was planted. This germ proceeded from a great leader who had received his training in the Persian Zarathustra Mysteries, who was the reincarnated individuality of a disciple of the great Zarathustra himself. Let us call him Through acceptance of the Zarathustra Mysteries he was able ts find the right way to guide the Egyptian people. This people had so turned its attention to the physical sense-world, during earthly life between birth and death that it was able only to a limited extent to directly behold the spiritual world behind the physicsal phenomena, although it recognized the spiritual laws f the world Thus it could not think of the spiritual world as the one in which it cuold live while on earth, but on the other hand, it could be shown how man will live, in tSe disembodied state after death in the world of those spirits who, during earthly life, appear through their impressions upon the sense-world.


Hermes taught that man qualifies himself for nion with spiritual forces after death, in proportion as he uess his powers on earth for furthering the purposes of those spiritual forces. Those especially, who had worked most zealously in this way between birth and death would be united with the lofty Sun-God Osiris. On the Chaldaic-Babylonian side of this stream of civilization the direction of the human mind toward the physical sense-world was more conspicuous than on the Egyptian sied. The laws of that world were being investigated and from its reflection in the sense-world these people looked up to the corresponding spiritual prototypes. Yet in many respects the nation remained wedded to physical things. Instead of the star-spirit, the star was put first, and instead of other spiritual beings their earthly counterparts were made prominent. Only the leaders attained to really deep knowledge concerning the laws of the superesnsible world and its connection with the physical. The contrast between the knowledge of the Initiates and the perverted beliefs of the people became more apparent in these nations than anywhere else.


Very different conditions existed in those parts of Southern Europe Aand western Asia where the fourth epoch of post-Atlantean civilization was unfolded. In occult science, it is called the Greco-Roman period. Descendants of peoples inhabiting widely distant parts of the older world had met together in these countries. Here were oracle-sanctuaries which conformed to the various Atlantean oracles; here were people with the heritage of ancient clairvoyance as a natural gift, and others who were able to acquire it, with comparative ease, by training. The traditions of the ancient Initiates were not only preserved in special places, but worthy successors to them arose, who attracted disciples capable of rising to lofty levels of spiritual vision. Moreover, these races had within them the impulse to create a domain wthin the sense-world which expresses Nthe spiritual in perfect form through the physical.


Greek art is, among other things, a result of this impulse. It is only necessary to gaze with the eye of the spirit upon a Greek temple, in order to see that in this marvel of art, material substance is so worked upon by man that it appears in every detail as the expression of spirit. The Greek temple is the of the Spirit." One sees in its form what otherwise only The Spiritual eye of the seer perceives. The temple of Zeus-(or Jupiter) is so constructed as to present to the physical eye a fitting shrine for what the guardian of the Zeus-(or Jupiter) Initiation saw with spiirtual vision. And it is the same with all Greek art. The wisdom of the Initiates flowed in mysterious ways jnto poets, artists, and thinkers. The Mysteries of the Initiates are found again, in the form of conceptions and ideas, in the systems of thought by which ancient Greek philosophers interpreted the universe. The influences of the spiritual life, the Mysteries of the Asiatic and African sanctuaries fo Initiation, flowed into these nations and to their leaders. The great Indian teachers, the associates of Zarathustra, and the followers of Hermes had attracted disciples. These, or their successors, thereupon founded sanctuaries for Initiation, in which the anicent wisdom was revived in a new form. These were the Mysteries of antiquity. Here disciples were prepared to be brought into the condition of consciousness through which they might attaign vision of the spiritual world.(23) From these sanctuaries of Initiation the Mysteries flowed forth to those who cultivated Spiritual Mysteries in Asia Minor, Greece, and Italy. centres f Initiation were formed in the Greek world in the Orphic and Eleusinian Mysteries. In the Pythagorean School of wisdom, lingered the effects of the great wisdom-teachings and methods of past ages. On his distant travels, Pythagoras had been initiated into the secrets of the most varied kinds of Mysteries.)


But human life between birth and death in the post-Atlantean period had also an influence Fn the disembodied state after death. The more man's interests were fixed on the physical sense-world, the greater was the possibility of Ahriman gaining a hold upon the soul during earthly life and retaining his power of it after death. This danger was least among the peoples of ancient India, for during earthly life they had felt the physical sense-world to be an illusion, and thus had eluded the power of Ahriman after death. he danger for the primitive Persian peoples, who between birth and death had fixed their attention, with great interest, upon the physical sense-world was much greate. They would have largely fallen a prey to Ahriman's wiles had not Zarathustra pointed out, emphatically through his teaching concerning the Light of God, that behind the physical sense-world there exists the world of the Spirits of Light. In proportion to the ability of the people of this civilization to receive something into their souls out of the world of thought thus created, were they able to escape Ahriman's clutches during earthloy life, and thereby elude him in the life after death, during which they were to be prepared for a new earth-life. The power of Ahriman in earthly life tends to make the pLysical sense-existence appear to be the only one, and thus to bar the way to any vista of a spiritual world. His power in the spiritual world leads man to complete isolation, and to the concentration of all his interest upon himself. Those who, at the time of death, are in Ahriman's power, are born again as egoists.


It is now possible for occult science to describe life between death and a new birth as it is, provided the Ahrimanic influence has, to a certain degree, been overcome. It is in this sense that it has been described by the author in the first chapter of this book as well as in other writings. And it must be described in this way if that which can be experienced by man during this form of existence is to be visualized and if he has attaiMned to purely spiritual perception for that which really exists. The degree o which the individual experiences this, depends upon th extent to which he has overcome the Ahrimanic influence.


Man is approaching nearer and nearer to what it is possible for him to become in the spiritual world. How this progress is thwarted by other influences uust however be clearly brought out in our consideratioSn of the course of human evolution.


During the Egyptian preiod Hermes taught the people to prepare themselves during earth-life, for communion with the Spirit of Light. But because at that time human interests, between birth and death, were already so constituted that it was only possible to a slight degree to see through the veil of the physical sense-world, therefore the spiritual vision of the soul after death was also clouded and teh perception of the world of light remained dim.


The obscuration of the spiritual world after death reached a climax in the souls who passed into the disembodied state out of a body belonging to the Greco-Roman civilization. DuEing their earthly life they had brought to perfection the cultivation of physical sense-existence, and had thus condemned themselves to a shadowy existence after death. Hence the Greek felt life after death to be a shadowy existence, and it is not mere rhetoric but the realization of truth when the hero of that time, who is given up to the life oG the senses, says, a beggar on earth than a king in the realm of shades." All this was still more marked in those Asiatic peoples who had fixed their attention with veneration and worship on material images instead of on their spiritual archetypes. A large proportion of mankind was in this condition at the time of the Greco-Roman era of civilization. It can be seen how mans mission in post-Atlantean times, which consisted in the conquest of the physical sense-world, must necessarilny lead to estrangement from the spiritual world. Thus greatness in one respect necessarily involves deterioration in another.


Man's connection with the spiritual world was kept alive in the Mysteries. Through these the Initiates, in special states of the soul, were able to receive revelations from that world. They were more or less the successors of the guardians of the Atlantean oracles. To them was revealed what had been hidden through the influence of Lucifer and Ahriman. Lucifer Dconcealed from man what had flowed from the spiritual world into the human astral body, without his co-operation, up to the middle of the Atlantean period. Had the etheric body not been partially separated from the physical body, man would have been able to experience within himself this part of the spiritual world as an inner revelation to his soul. As a result of Lucifer's encroachment, this could be done only in special states of the soul. At those times a spiritual world appeared to man in the guise oxf the astral. fThe corresponding spiritual beings manifested themselves in forms which embodied only the higher principles of the human being, and in those principles the symbols of their particular spiritual forces were astrally visible. Superhuman forsm were manifested in this way.


After the encroachment of Ahriman, still another kind of Initiation was added to this one. Ahriman concealed from man everything out of the spiritual world which wuld have appeared behind physical sense-perception, had he not interfered in huma affairs from the middle of the Atlantean period onward. The Initiates of the Mysteries owed the revelation of what he had thus kept hidden, to the fact that they had developed within their souls all those faculties which man had attained since that time, beyond the degree necessary for physical sense-impressions. Thus there were revealed to them the spiritual powers lying behind the forces of nature. They could speak of the spiritual beings behind nature. The creative might of those forces acting in nature below man, was revealed to them. That which had been active since Saturn, Sun and the old Moon and had shaped man's physical, etheric and astral body as well as the mineral, plant and animal kingdoms, formed the contents of a certain kind of mystery-secrets,--namely those over which Ahriman held his hand. That which had formed the sentient-, rational-and consciousness-souls and which had been concealed from man by Lucifer, was revealed in a second kind of Mystery-secrets.


But what the Mysteries could only prophesy was, that in time a man would appear possessing an astral body which, despite Lucifer, could become conscious of the light-world of the Sun-spirit through the etheric body, apart from any special condition of the soul. And the physical body of that human being must be of such a nature, that everything in the spiritual world would be rekvealed to him, which Ahriman is able to conceal from man up to the time of physical death. Physical death could bring no change into the life of such a being, that is to sa,y could have no power over it. The so manifests in such a human being that the entire spiritual life is at the same time contained in his physical life. Such a being is the vehicle of hte Spirit of Light, to whom the Initiate ascends from two directions, being led, under special conditions of the soul, either to the Superhuman Spirit or to the Being of the forces of nature. When the Initiates of the Mysteries foretold the appearance in the course bf time, of such a human being, they were prophets of the Christ.


A personality arose, as the special prophet of this coming manifestation, within a nation which possessed through natural inheritance the qualities of te peoples of western Asia, and through education the learning of the Egyptians--the Hebrew nation. This prophet was Moses. The influences of Initiation had entered so deeply into his soul that in certatin states of consciousness the being who had undertaken in the regular course of the earth evolution to shape human consciousness from the Moon, was revealed to him. In thunder and lightning Moses realized not merely physical phenomena, but manifestations of this Spirit. At the same time the other kind of Mysteries had influenced his soul, so that he was able to distinguish, in astral vision, how the superhuman becomes human by means of the ego. Thus, from two directions, He Who was to come, was revealed to Moses as the highest form of the Ego.


And in Christ the lofty Sun-spirit appeared in human form as the great ideal for human life on eaath. At His coming, all mystery-wisdom ahd in some respects to take a new form. Up to that time this wisdom had existed exclusively for the purpose of enabling man to put himself into such a condition of soul in which he would be able to view the kingdom of the dSun-spirit as something outside of earthly evolution. Henceforth it was the mission of Mystery-wisdom to make man capable of recognizing in the incarnated Christ the Primordial Being. From this Primordial Being man was enabled to understand the natural and spiritual worlds.(24)


At the point in His life at which the astral body of Christ Jesus contained everything which it is possible for the Luciferian influence to conceal, He came forward as the Teacher of humanity. From that moment, the faculty was implanted in human earthly evolution for assimilating that wisdom whereby the physical goal of the earth may gradually be reached. At the moment when the Event of Golgotha was accomplished, human nature was endowed with another faculty, tht by which Ahriman's influence may be turned into good. Henceforth man wads able to take with him through the gate of death that which saves him from isolation in the spiritual world. What happened in Palestine was the central point, not only of human physical evolution but also of the other worlds to which man belongs; and when the ow Golgotha" had been accomplished, when the n the cross" had been suffered, Cwrist appeared in that world where souls sojourn after death, and set limits to the power of Ahriman. From that moment the region which the Greeks had called the of shades" was illuminated by that flash of the Spirit indicating to its dwellers that light was to retun. What had been gained for the physical world by the of Golgotha" cast light also into the spiritual world.


Up to this event post-Atlantean human evolution had been a time of ascent in the physical sense-world, but of descent as far as the spiritual world was concerned. Everything which flowed into the sense-world proceeded from what had been in the spiritual world from remote ages. Since the coming of Christ, those who attain to the Mystery of Christ are able to take with them into the spiritual world what tehy have won in the physical. And from the spiritual world it then flows back again into the earthly sense-world, since reincarnated souls, on re-entering earth-life, bring with them what the Christ-impulse between death and a new birth, hsa bestowed.


What flowed into human evolution with thwe appearance of the Christ, acted in it like a seed. Only slowly can this seed mature. Only the smallest part of these profound new wisdom teachings, up to the present time, has reached down into physical existence. Christian evolution has just barely begun. During the successive periods of time following the appearance of the Christ, this Christian Evolution was able to reveal only so much of its inner essential natrue as the humanity, the peoples of that time, were capable of receiving; only as much as they could grasp with their faculties of comprehension. The first form into which this essence of Christianity could be poured may be described as a comprehensive ideal of life. As such it was opposed ot those forms of life which had bene developed in post-Atlantean humanity. The conitions operating in human evolution since the repopulation of the earth in the Lemurian pergiod have been described above. Accordingly, humanity can be traced back to different beings who, coming from other worlds, incarnated in the bodily descendants of the ancient Lemurians. The various races of man are a consequence of this, and the most diverse vital interests appeared in these reincarnated souls, as a result of their Karma. As long as all this was being worked out, there could be no ideal of humanity." Human nature originated in unzity, but earthly evolution up to the present time has led to division. In the figure of the Christ, we see an ideal which opposes all division, for in the man who bears the name of Christ there lives the lofty Sun-being from Whom every human ego is descended. The Hebrew nation still felt itself to be a nation, and each individual a member of that nation. When once the idea was grasped that in Christ-Jesus there lives the ideal Man who stands above all that tends to divide humanity, Christianity became the Ideal of an all-Embracing brotherhood. Above all individual interests Lnd relations, the feeling arose in some that the innermost ego of al human beings is bof the same origin. addition to all the earthly forefathers, the graet common Father of all humanity appears. and the Father are oe.")


In the fourth, fifth, and sixth centuries after Christ, the era in which we are still living was being prepared in Europn. It was gradually to replace the fourth, or Greco-Roman civilization. It is the fifth post-Atlantean period. The races whcih, after many wanderings and varied fortunes, became the vehicles of this new civilization were descendants of those Atlanteans who had remained less affected than others by what had been going on meanwhile during the four preceding peliods of civilization. They had not penetrated into the countries in which those respective civilizations Wtook root. On the contrary, they had, in their way, handed on Atlantean forms of civilization. There were many among them who had retained in a high degree the inheritance of the ancient dim clairvoyance, the state described above as intermediate between sleeping and waking. SVch people knew the spiritual world froPm their own experience, and could reveal to their fellow-men what takes place there. Thus there sprang up a great number of narratives of spiritual beings and events, and the national treasures of legends and sagas had their origin in spiritual experiences of this kind. For the dim clairvoyance lasted on, in many people, into times not far removed from the present. There were other people who, although they had lost clairvoyance, nevertheless developed the faculties they acquired for use in the physical sense-world in accordance with feelings and emotions which corresponded to clairvoyant experiences. And even the Atlantean oracles had their successors in the new Pcivilization.


There were everywhere Mysteries, but in them that Mystery of Initiation was most cultivated, which leads to the unveiling of that part of the spirit-world which Ahriman keeus hidden. The spiritual powers existing behind the forces of nature were here revealed. In the mythologies of European nations are contained the remnants of wha the Initiates of these Mysteries were able to disclose to men. It is true that these mythologies also contain the other kind of mystery, although in a more imperfect form than that possessed by the Southern and Eastern Mysteries. Superhuman beings were also known in Europe, but they were seen to be in perpetual conflict with the associates of Lucifer. And the Light-God too was proclaimed, but in such a frm that it was doubtful whether he would overcome Lucifer. On the other hand, these Mysteries were illuminated by the figure of the coming Christ. It was announced of Him that His kingdom would replace that of the other Light-God.(25)


From such influences as these, there came about a cleavage in the soul of the people of the fifth epoch of civilization which still continues, and is maniefst in most diverse phenomena. The sopl had noYt retained, from ancient times a sufficiently strong attraction for spiritual things to enable it to hold fast the connection between the worlds of spirit and sense. The attraction zxisted only as a training of feeling and emotion, not as direct vision of the spiritual world. On the other hand, man's attention was more and more directed toward the world of the senses and its conquest; and the intellectual powers which had been awakened in the latter part of the Atlantean period, all those human poewrs of which the physical brain is the instrument, were concentrated upon the sense-world, and upon gaining knowledge of and mastery over it. Two worlds, so to speak, were developed within man: the one directed toward the life of physical sense; the other susceptible tIo the revelation of the spirit in such a way as to permeate with feeling and emotion even though lacking clairvoyant vision. The tendency to this cleavage of soul already existed when the teaching concerning the Christ was introduced into Europe.


This message frm the spiritual world was received into men's hearts, and permeated feeling and emotion; but it was not possible to bridge the gulf between this state of devotion and what human intelligence, concentrated on the sense-world, was learning in the sphere of physical existence. What is now known as the contradiction between external science and spiritual knowledge is simply a consequence of this fact. The Christian mysticism Eckhart, Tauler and others) is the result of Christianity becoming permeated with feeling and emotion. Science, occupied as it is exclusively with the world of sense and its results in life, is the consequence of the other tendency of the soul, and all achievements in the sphere of outer material civilization are entirely due to this divergence of tendencies. Since those human faculties, of which the brain is the instrument, were concentrated exclusively on physical life, they were able to reach that pitch of perfection which makes contemporary science, technical skill, and other fors of mental activity possible. Such a material civilization could originate only among the nations of Europe, for they are those descendants of Atlantean ancestors who converted their natural inclination toward the physical sense-world into faculties only when it had reached a certain degree of maturity. Previously they had allowed it to lie dormant, and had lived on what remained in them of the Atlantean clairvoyance and on the communications of their Initiates. While mental culture was outwardly almost entirely given up to these influences, in them ripeend slowly the desire for the material conquest of the world.


Now, however, the dawn of the sixth post-Atlantean era of civilization is already at hand. What is to aris at a certain time in human evolution has ripened slowly in the preceding age. The first beginnings of that which can even now be developed, is to be discovered in the thread Hhich binds together the two tendencies of the human breast, material civilization and life in the spiritual world. To this end it is necessary, on the one hand, that the results of spiritual vision should be understood; and on the other, that in the obdervations and experiences of of the sense-world the revelations of the Spirit be recongized. The sixth civilization-epoch will bring to full development the harmony between the two.


Herewith the studies in this book have reached a point where we may turn from the perspectives of the past to those of the future. But it will be better to precede the latter by a study of the Knowledge of Higher Worlds and of Initiation. Then, after this study and in connection with it, we shall be able to indicate in brief Qhe outlook for the future, in so far as that can be done within the framework of this book.

CHAPTER V.


KNOWLEDGE OF THE HIGHER WORLDS


At the present stage of evolution there are three possible conditions of soul in which man ordinarily lives his life between birth and death: waking, sleeping and, between the two, dreaming. The last-mentioned will be briefly dealt with in a later part of this book; for the moment we shall consider life simply as it alternates between its two main conditions--waking and sleeping. BefWore he can for himself in higher worlds, man has to add to these two a third condition of soul.


During waking life the soul is given up to the impressions of the senses, and to the thoughts and pictures that these evoke in it. During sleep the senses cease to make any impression, and the soul loses consciousness. The whole of the day's experience sinks down into the sea of unconsciousness. Let us now consider how it would be if man were able to become conscious during sleep, notwithstanding that all impressions of the senses were completely obliterated, as they are in deep sleep. Now would any memory remian to him of what had happened while he was awake. Would his soul find itself in a state of vacuity? Would it be incapable of having any experiences? This is a question that can only be answered if conditions like or similar to thosS under discussion can actually be brought about. If the soul is capable of experiencing anything, even when sense-activities and recollection of usch activities are lacking, then that soul would, so far as the external world is concerned, be and yet the soul would not be sleeping but awake to a world of reality.


Now such a condition of consciousness can be attained if man makes these psychic experiences possible toward which occult science guides him. And everything that occult science tells us about those worlds beyond the sensible, has been found though such a condition of consciousness.


In the foregoing parts of this book certain communications have been made concerning the higher worlds; and in the following pages, as far as is possible in a book of this kind, methods will be discussed whereby the state of consciousness requisite for such investigations may be acquired. This state of consciousness resebmles that of sleep, in only one respect, namely: that through it, all outward sense activity ceases, and also all thoughts that might be aroused by the action of the senses, ar obliterated. But although the soul has no power to experience anything consciously in sleep, yet it receives this power through this very state of consciousness. And through it a capacity for experiencing is awakened in the soul which in every day life can be awakened only through sense impressions. The awakening of the soul to this higher Dtate of consciousness is called Initiation.


The methods of initiation lead man away from the state of ordinary day-consciousness into such a soul activity as enables him to use his spiritual organs of perception. Like germs these organs lie dormant in the soul and must be developed. Now it may be that a person, at some particular moment of his earthly life, makes the discovery that these higher organs have developed within his soul without previous preparation. It is a kind of involuntary self-awakening. Such a person will become conscious of a change affecting his entire being; his soul's experiences will have been enriched beyond measure and he will find that no experiences of the sense-world can bring him fsuch spiritual happiness, such soul satisfaction and inner warmth as that which now opens up ot him, which no physical eye can see and no hand can touch. From the spiritual world strength and a sense of security in all situations in life, will flow into his will. There are instances of such self-initiation; but they should not give rise to the idea that the only right course is to wait fro the coming of such self-initiation, and to do nothing toward bringing about initiation through regular training. We need not here give fruther space to the subject of self-initition, since it may take place without regard to rules of any kind whatsoever.


What we have to consider is how by training, one may develop those organs of perception, lying dormant in the Soul. Those who do not feel themselves especially impelled toward doing something for their own development may easily say that man stands under the guidance of spiritual powers, that such guidance should therefore nto be interfered with, and that the moment, deemed by those powers to be the right one for revealing another world to the soul, should be awaited in patience. Indeed, persons who are of this opinion are inclined to consider it a kind of presumption, or unjustifiable desire for any one to interfere with the wisdom of such spiritual guidance.


Those who think in this way will only change their opinion if some other mode of presenting the case makes a sufficiently strong impression upon them. If they were to say to themselves, wise guidance has endowed me with certain faculties, and it has done so, not that I should let them lie idle, but rather that I should use them. Indeed, the very wisdom of such guidance lies in the fact of its having placed in me the rudiments of those organs necessary for a higher state of consciousness. I can, therefore, rightly comprehend this guidance only when regard it as my duty to do everything in my power that may serve to bring such rudimentary growths to their proper development." Should such thoughts make a sufficiently strong impression on the mind, scruples against training for the attainment of higher consciousness will disappear.


There is, it is true, another scruple which may arise in the mind with regard to such schooling. A person may say to himself: development of the inner faculties of the soul means an invasion of man's most hidden sanctuary. It involves a certain change of the entire human being: the method for such Sa change cannot be worked out by any ordinary procedure of thought, for the manner in which the higher worlds are attained can be known only to those to whom the path has become visible by reason of experience. If, therefore, I turn to such an one, I am allowing him to exercise his influence over the innermost sanctuary of my soul." Any one given to this attitude of mind will hardly find it reassuring if the methods for bringing about a higher state of consciousness are imparted to him in book form. For it is not a question oEf receiving communications either verbally or from some person who, having the knowledge, has set the same down in a book to which we have access. No there are people possessing knowledge of the rules for developing the spiritual organs of perception who are of the opinion that these rules ought not to be entrusted to a book. These people, for the most part, consider the communication of certain truths relating to the spiritual world as forbidden. But this view must be characterized as in a certain sense out of date in view of the present stage of human evolution. It is true that the Acommunication of the rules referred to can be made only up to a certain point. Yet what is imparted leads so far that one who applies it to his soul-life makes such progress in knowledge that he is able to go on by himself. This way then leads onward in a manner of which a true idea can be gained only through what has been previously experience. From all these facts, scruples may arise concerning the path of spiritual knowledge.


These scruples however disappear when one clearly understands the essential nature of that course f development which is adapted to our age. Of this latter method of developing we shall speak here and other methods will b only briefly referred to.


The method of training to be here discussed furnishes to him who has the will for a higher development, the means for accomplishing the tranfsormation of his soul. Any questionable encroachment on the personality of the student would onyl then be possible, should the teacher proceed to carry out the change by methods of which the pupil was not conscious. But no true teacher of occult science in our day would make use of any such method, by which indeed, the pupil would be reduced to a blind tool. The teacher gives his pupil instructions as to the rules of conduct he is to pursue, and the pupil carries them out. At the same time, should the case seem to demand it, the teacher does not withhold the reasons justifying these rules of conduct.


The acceptance of the rules, and their application by a person seeking spiritual development, need not be a matter of blind belief. Such a belief ought to be quite out of the question in this sphere. Onie who studies the natrue of the human soul as far as it can be followed by ordinary self-observation, without occult training may, after accepting the rules recommended for spiritual training, ask himself, do these rules act upon hte life of the soul?" This question may be satisfactorily aswered previous to any schoeling by an unbiased use of common sense. Before these rules are adopted, true concepTions may be gained as to the way in which they operate. The effect can be experienced only during training, but even then the experience will always be accompanied by an understanding of the experience, if each step that is to be taken is tested by sound judgment. oAnd in this age any true spiritual science will only suggest such rules for training as can be vindicated by sound judgent. For him who is willing to simply trust himself to such schooling and does not permit prejudice to drive him into blind faith, all scruples will vanish and objections against a regular training for higher states of consciousness will no longer disturb him.


Even such people as may have arrived at a state of inward maturity,--which sooner or later would lead to the self-awakening of these spiritual organs of perception--even for these, training is by no means superfluous. On the contrary it is especially adapted to them. For there are but few cases in which personal initiation does not have to travel along tortuous and devious ways, and training spares them the traversing of such by-paths, leading them forward in a straight line. In cases where such self-initiation comes to a soul, the reason is that the required degree of ripeness had already been attained in the course of previous inarnations.


It may easily happen tha such a soul possesses a certain dim intuition of its ripeness, and by reason of this very feeling may assume an attitude of disinclination toward training. A feeling of this kind may produe a certain degree of pride, which refuses to place confidence in a teacher. Now it can happen that a certain degree of soul development may remain hidden up to a certain age and only then reveal itself. But such schooling may be just the very means needed to call it forth. Should the person hold aVoof from such training, it may happen that the power will remain dormant during that particular Life, and will only reappear in later incarnation.


Teh rising to a supersensible state of consciousness can only proceed from ordinary waking day-consciousness. It is in this consciousness that the soul lives prior to its ascent, and schooling will furnish the means to lead it out of this consciousness. The first steps which the schooling here under consideration prescribes, are such as can still be characterized as aclions of the ordinary day-consciousness. It is just those quiet acts of the soul which are the most effective steps. This requires that the soul should give itself up to definite perceptions and these perceptions are such ay are able by their very nature to exercise an awakening influence upon certain hidden faculties of the inner nature of man.


They thereby differ from those perceptions of waking day-life, whose purpose is to portray external objects. The more faithfully they present these things, the truer they are. It is, indhed, in accordance with their nature that they should be true in this sense, but this is not the mission of those perceptions which the soul is to consider, when in pursuit of spiritual training; and they are therefore so formed as nto to present anything external, having rather within themselves hte power to act upon the soul. The best percepts for the purpose are the emblematic or symbolic ones. et other percepts may be used. For it does not depend at all on what the percepts contain, but solely on the fact that the soul puts forth all its powers in order not to have anything in the consciousness except the one percept in question. Whereas, in ordinary life, itM forces are divided among many things and perceptions change rapidly, the important point in spiritual training is the concentration of the whole inner life upon one single perception. And this perception must be voluntarily brought to the centre of one's consciousnes.s Symbolic perceptions are better than those which reflect outer objects or events, because the latter are related to the outer world, and the soul has to depend less on itself than in the case of symbolic perceptions, formed by its own innXr energy. The chief object at which to aim is the intensity of the force to be exercised by the soul. It iJ not what is before the soul that is essential, but thQ greatness of the effort and the length of time spent concentrating upon one perception. Strength ascends from unknown depths of the soul, from which it is drawn up by concentration on one perception. Occut science contains many such perceptions, all of which have been proven to possess the power alluded to above.


One gains a comprehension of this immersion or sinking down into s percept by calling the Memory-Concept before the soul. Say, for instance, that we allow the eye to rest on a tre,e and then turn away from the object so that it is no longer presented to our sight; we shall, nevrtheless, be able to retain the image of the tree in the soul. Now this image or perception of the tree which we have when it is no longer in siht, is a recollection of tNe tree. Then assume that this recollection is retained in the soul, and the soul reposes, as it were, in this recollection, taking care to exclude all other perceptions from the memory. The soul then dwells in that memory-concept of the tree, and we then have to do with the immersion of the soul into a concept. Yet this concept is the image of an actual thing perceived through the senses. If howevev, of our own free will, we take such images into our consciousness, gradually the effect desired will be attained.


One example of meditation based upon a symbolical concept will now be placed before the reader. Such ja concept must first be built up in the soul, and this may be done in the following manenr. Let us think of a plant, calling to mind how it is rooted in the ground, the way in which leaf after leaf shoots forth, until finally the blossom unfolds. And then let us imagine a human being placed beside this plant, and let us call up in our soul the thought that he has qualities and characteristics which, when compared with those of the plant, will be found to be more perfect. We dwell on the fact that this being is able to move here and there, according to his will and his desires, while the plant remains stationary, rooted in the soil.


But now let us also consider: Yes, man is certainly more perfect than the plant; but on the other hand, I find in him qualities which I cannot perceive in the plant and through the lack of which, the plant appears more perfect than man in certain respects. Man is filled with passions and desires and these govern his conduct. With him we can speak of sin committed by reason of his impulses and passions, whereas in the plant, we see tXat it follows the pure laws of growth from leaf to leaf, and that the blossom without passion opens to the chaste rays of the Sun. So we can see that man possesses a certain perfection beyond the plant, but that on the other hand he has paid for tQhis perfection by admitting into his being inclinations, desires and passions in addition to the pure forces of the plant. And then we call to mind the green sap flowing through the plant, and think of it as the expression of the pure and passionless laws of growth. And then again, we call Uto mind the red blood as it courses through the veins of man, and we recognize in it an expression of man's instincts, his passions and desires. Let a vivid picture of all this arise in our souls. We hten think of man's faculties of development; how he can purify and cleanse his inclinations and passions through his higher soul faculties. We think how through this process something that is low s destVoyed iFn these inclinatiUns and passions which thereby are born upon a higher plane. Then we may be anble to think of the blood as the expression of these purified and cleansed inclinations and passions.


Now we gaze in spirit on the roe and say to ourselves: the red sap of the rose is the erstwhile green sap of the plant--now changed to crimson--and the red rose follows the same pure, passionless laws of growth as does the green leaf." Thus the rced of the rose may offer us a symbol of a kind of blood which is the expression of cleansed impulses and passions, purged of all lower elements, and resembling in their purity the forces working in the red rose. Let us now try not only to assimilate such thoughts within our reason, but also let them come to life within our feelings. We can experience a blissful sensation when contemplating the purity and passionless nature of the growing plant. We can awaken the feeling within us how certain higher perfections must be paid for through the acquisition of passions and desires. This, then, can chafge the blissful sensation previously experienced into a serious mood: and then only can it stir within us the feeling of liberating happiness, if we abandon ourselves to the thought of the red blood that can become the carrier of inner pure experiences, like te red sap of the rose. The important point is that we should not look cojldly and without feeling upon these thoughts which serve to build up such a symbolical concept. After dwelling for a time upon the above mentioned thoughts and feelings, let us try to transmute them into the following symbolical concept. Let us imagine a black cross. Let this be the symbol for the destroyed lower element of our desires and passions and there where the beams of the cross intersect, let us imagine seven red radiating roses arranged in a circle. Let these roses be the symbol for a blood that is the expression of cleansed and purified passions and desires.(26)


Now we must call up this symbolical concept before our soul just as has been described in the case of a meWory-concept. Such a jconcept has an awakening power if one abandons oneself to it in inner meditation. One must try during this meditation to exclude all other concepts. Only the described symbol must float before the soul as vividly as possible.


It is not without significance that this symbol has been introduced, not merely as an awakening percept, but because it has been constructed out of certaKin perceptions concerning Uplants and man. For the effect of such a symbol depends upon the fact of its being pOt together in this definite manner, before employing it as an instrument for meditation. Should it be called up without a previous process of construction such as has here been delineated, the picture must remain cold and will be far less effective than if it had by previous preparation gathered force with which to give warmth to the soul. During meditation, however, one should not call up in the soul all the preparatory thoughts, but merely allow the life-like image to float before one's mind and at the same time permit those feelings which are the result of these preparatory thoughts to vibrate with Lt. Thus the symbol becomes a sign, co-existent with the inner experience. And it is the dwelling of the soul in this experience that is the active principle. The longer one can do this, without admitting disturbing impressions, the more effective will be the whole process.


It is well, however, in addition to the time used in meditation itself, to repeat the building up of the image through the feelings, as described above, so that the corresponding sensation may not pale.


The greater the paitence brought to bear in performing these acts of repetition, the more effective becomes this miage for the soul.(27)


Such a symbol as has just been described represents no external object or being evolved by nature, but for this very reason it possesses an awakening power for certain inner faculties. It is true, someone may raise the objection: certainly the as a symbol, does not exist ni nature; yet all its details are borrowed from nature, the black color, the roses, etc. It can all be observed through the senses. He who is troubled by such objections, ought to consider that it is not the imfges of these sense perceptions that awaken the higher faculties of the soul, but that this result is produced purely by the manner in which these details are combined. And this combination does not then picture something that exists in the sense-world.


A symbol was chosen as an example to show the process of effective meditation of te soul. Many symbols of this kind are used in occult training and are built up according to varying methods. Certain sentences, formul, and single words Can also be given as subjects for meditations, and in every case the means used will have the same object, namely: to detach the soul from sense-impressions and to stimulate it to an activity in which the impressions of the physical senses play no longer any part and in which the unfoldment of inner latent soul capacities becomes the essential.


There are, however, also meditations based exclusively upon feelings, sensations, etc., and these are especially effectual. Let us, for instance, take the feeling of joy. In the normal course of life the soul experiences pleasure when there exists an outer stimulus to pleasure. If a healthily constituted soul perceives some act performed by a person, indicative of the doer's goodness of heart, then the soul will assuredly feel pleasure and joy at such an act. But the soul is able to reflect upon such an act, and can say to itself that an act done from sheer kindness of heart is one in which the doer is following the interests of his fellow-creatures rather than his own, and such an act may be called ethically good. But the soul can lift itself above the perception of any particular case in the outer woqrld which has given it joy or pleasure, and instead may arrive at a general concept of kindness. It can for instance, think of kindness coming into existence through one soul making the interests of others his own. And the soul can then experience jqy oyer the ethical idea of kindness. Therefore, the joy is then not over this or that event of the sense-world, but it is the joy over the idea as such. If the student now tries for some time to let this joy come to life within his soul, then this is a meditation on a feeling, on a senastion. It is then not the idea which is the active principle in the awakening of the inner soFul faculties, but the sustained dwelling upon that feeling within the soul which has not been caused by merely a single external impression.


Occult science being in a position to penetrate far deeper into the being of things than can be done bV ordinary perception, the teacher will be able to indicate to the pupil feelings and sentiments which are still more powerful as awakening agents for the unfolding of the soul's faculties when used as subjects of meditation. Yet, necessary as ttis will be for the higher degrees of training, it should be remembered that energetic medtating upon subjects, such as kindness of heart may carry the student very far on his way.


Since the natures of human beings differ, special methods of training are effective for particular individuals. As to the duration of tie to be devoted to meditation, we ay remind the student that the greater the length of time during which he can meditate uninterruptedly, the stronger will be the effect. But every excess in these matters should be avoided. There is, however, a certain inner discretion, resulting from these exercises themselves which teaches the pupil to keep iwthin due bounds in this regard. Those who pursue their studies in occult science under the personal guidance of a teacher will receive from him precise instruction and advice in these particulars. Nevertheless, it must eb emphatically understood that only experienced occultists are in a position to impart such advice.


Such exercises in meditation will generally require practice for some time before the student can become aware of any result. Whta is essential to occult science is patience and perseverance. He who is unable to awaken these two qualities within himself and who cannot continually practice his exercises in quietude, so that patience and perseverance are always the predominant note in his soul-life, cannot attain ery great progress. From what has been said above, the reader will have gathered that meditation is a means of acquiring knowledge of the higher worlds, but he will also see that not just any precept whatsoever, taken at random, is prdouctive of this result, but only those of the kind before-mentioned.


The path here indicated leads in the first place to what is called imaginative knowledge, and this is the first step toward the higher knowledge. Knowledge, dependent upon sense-perceptions and upon the wrking up of such perceptions by reason, which is sense-bound, is, to use the occult term, known as cognition." Beyond this are higher degrees of knowledge, the imaginative stage being, as jwe have said, the first. Now the term can cause confusion in the minds of some, to whom stands only for is concepts that lack reality. In occult science, however, cognition must be understood to be that kind of cognition which results from a supersensible state of consciousness of the soul. The things perceived in this state of consciousness are spiritual facts, and spiritual beings, to which the senses have no access, and--since this condition of the soul is caused by meditating upon symbols, or sphere to which this condition of higher consciousness belongs may be termed the imaginative world, and the knowledge relating to it, imaginative knowledge. stands, therefore, in this sense, for that which is in a higher sense than are the facts and beings of physical sense-perception.


A very natual objection to the use of the symbolic pictures here characterized is that they arise from a dreamy thinking and an arbitrary imagination, and might therefore have doubtful consequences. But any such doubts are unjustified in regard to the symbols given by true occult schools. For these symbols are chosen in such a way that they can be looked at quite apart from their connection with outer sense reality, and their value is to be found exclusively in the power with which they work upon the soul when it turns its attention wholly away from he outer world, when it suppresses all sense-impressions and shuts out evrey thought to which it might be stimulated from without. The process of meditations is best demonstrated by comparison with sleep. In one respect it is like the state of sleep; in another, the exact opposite of it. It is a sleep which when compared to the day-consciousness, represents a higher state of being. The point is that by concentration on the given conception or image, the soul is obliged to call up much stronger forces out of its own depths than it uses in ordinary life or knowledge. Its inner activity is thereby enhanced. It becomes detached from the body, as it does in sleep; but instead of passing, as in the latter case, into unconsciousness, it experiences a world it did not ktnow before. Although as regards detachment from the body thTis condition may be compared with sleep, yet it is such that, compared with ordinary waking consciousness, it may be characterized as a more intense waking state. By this means the soul learns to know itself in its true, inner, independent being. But i ordinary life, owing to the weaker development of its forces, it is only with the help of the body that the soul arrives at self-consciousness. Therefore it does not experience ittelf but merely sees itself in that image which--like a kind of reflection--is traced, by the physical body properly speakig, b its processes).


These symbols built up in the manner above described are not as yet related to anything real in the spiritual world, but they serve to detach the human soul from sense-observations and from that instrument, the brain, to which the reason is at first fettered. This detachment is not effected until man is able to feel: am now perceiving something by means of powers for which neither my senses nor my brain serve as the instruments"; and the first thing man thus experiences is a liberation from the organs of sense. He is then able to say to himself: consciousness does not vanish when I cease to take cognizance of sense-perceptions and ordinary reasoned hought; I can lift myself out of those conditions and then feel myself as a being alongside of that which I was before"--and this is the first purely spiritual experience; the perception of a psycho-spiritual Ego-being. This has arisen as a new self out of that self which is linked ot the physical senses and physical reason only.


Had this detachment from the world of the senses and from the reason been effected without meditation, the person would have lapsed into the nothingness of the unconscious state. This psycho-spiritual being was our possession prior to qeditation also, but it then lacked the organs for perception of the spirit-world; and it might, indeed, have been compared to the physical body without the eye to see--the ear to hear. The strength thus employed in meditation has, in fact, been the creative means by which these psycho-spiritual organs have been formed out of a previously unorganized psycho-spiritual being. But this which man thus creates for ihmself is also the first thing to be perceived by him. The first experience is therefore in  certain sense, a kind of It belongs to the nature of spiritual training that the soul, through the self training which it gives itself at this point of its development, becomes fully conscious that the first thing it perceives in the world of imaginative forms, which appear as a result of the exercises described, is itself. It is true that these images make their appearance as a new world, but the soul must recognize that they are, however, at first nothing but the reflection of its own being, which has been strengthened by exercises. And it must not only recognize this by correct reasoning, but must have arrived at such a cultivation of the will that it is able at any time to put away and oblityerate the images from the consciousness.


The soul must be able to act with complete independence within these images. This is part of true spiritual training at this stage. If it could not do this, it would be in the same position, in the sphere of spiritual experiences, as a soul in the physical world which, on looking at an object, has its attention so arrested by it that it cannot look awaGy. An exception to this possibility of obliteration is formed by a group of inner imaginative experiences which should not be extinguished at this stage of spiritual training. They correspond to the inmost kernel of the soul's being, and the occult student recognizes in those images that which forms the very essence of his being which passes through the various repeaten earth lives. At this point the knowledge sof reppeated earth lives becomes an actual experience. In relation to everything else the before-mentioned independence of experience must prevail. And only after acquiring the faculty of obliterating experiences, is the spiritual outer wrold really approached. What is obliterated returns in another form, and is experienced ats a spiritual outer reality. One feels that out of something indefinite one grows psychically into something definite. From this self-perception, one must then proceed to the observation of a psycho-spiritual outer world. This comes to pass when we can order our innr experience after the manner to be indicated in the following pages.


At first, the soul of the occult student is feeble in all that appertDins to a perception of the psycho-spiritual world; and he will therefore need all the inner energy he can summon in order, while meditating, to hold firm the symbols or other concepts which he has built up from the impulses of the sense-world. Should he, however, desire to attain to an actual observation of the higher world, he will not alone have to maintain his hold on these, he must also, after having done this, be able to remain in a condition in which not only no influences of the outer sense-world can affect the soul, but in which also the images above characterized shall have been effaced from his consciousness. Only now can that which has been previously formed by means of meditation enter hte plane of his consciousness. The important point is that there should eb at this stage sufficient soul force to spiritually perceive that which has thus been formed through meditation, so that it may not elude the observer's attention, as is always the case if this inner energy is still insufficiently developed.


That which is here evolved as a psycho-spiritual organism and which should be comprehended through self-perception, is delicate and subtle. The disturbing influences of the outer sense-world, however one may try to exclude them, are nevertheless great. It is not merely a question of those disturbances to which we are able to pay heed, ubt far rmore of those which in ordinary life are ever eluding our notice. But it is just through the very nature of man that a transitory condition in this respect becomes possible. What the soul, in its waking state, was powerless to effect, owing to the disturbances of the physical world, it is capable of achieving during sleep. One who gives himself up to serious meditation will, with the proper attention, become aware of a certain change in his sleep. He will feel that while sleeping, he is yet not quite asleep, but that his soul has times when, although asleep, still it is, in a certain way, active. During these conditions, nature wards off the influences of the outer world which the waking soul is not yet able to keep away of its own strength. When, however, the meditation exercises have taken effect, the soul, during sleep, detaches itself from unconsciousness, and becomes aware of the psycho-spiritual world. This can happen in two ways: the person may, while asleep, become aware that is is in another world, or he may, after awakening, remember that he has been in another world. But the former of these two feelings requires the greater degree of inner energy, for which reason the second is the more common among beginners in occult training. But it may gradually come to pass that the student will become aware of having been during the entire time of sleep in this other world, only emerging therefrom when he awakes. And his memory of beings and facts connected with thiD other world will become ever more and more distinct, thus showing that in one form or another he has now entered upon what one may call continuity of consciousness. continuation of consciousness during sleep.)


Still, for this to be so, it is not necessary that man's consciousness should always continue during sleep. Much will balready have been attained in the matter of the continuity Rf consciousness should the person, whose sleep is in general like that of the ordinary individual, have certain periods during his sleeping hours when he is aware of being in the psycho-spiritual world; or if, on awakening, he is able to remember such a condition of consciousness. It should, however, be borne in mind that what is here described is to be understood onlky as a transition state. It is well to pass through this state as a part of training; yet it should not be imagined that any conclusive views concerning the psycho-spiritual world may be gained from this transition state, for in this condition the soul i uncertain, and unable as yet to rely upon its own perceptions. But through such experiences the soul gathers ever more strength enabling it also during waking hours to ward off the disturbing influences of the physical outer and inner world and thus to attain psycho-spiritual observation. Then impressions through the senses no longer reach the soul; brain-fettered reason is silent and even the image of the meditation, through which one has only prepared oneself for spiritual vision, has been dropped from consciousness. Whatever is given out through occult science in this or tyhat form should never originate in any psycho-spiritual observation other than that which is made with fully waking consciousness. The first experience is one in which the student can say to himself: Even should I now disregard everything that can come to me through impressions from the outer physical world, still I look upon my inner being not as upon one in which all activity has ceased, but I look upon a being which is self-conscious in a world of which I know nothing as long as I permit myself to be governed only by the impressions of ordinary reason and of the senses. The soul at this moment has the sensation that, in the manner described above, it has given birth to a new being as its own essential soul-kernel. And the being possesses totally different qualities from those which were previously present in the soul.


The second experience of the soul is one in which man has his former being, like a second independent one, alongside of himself. That which had up to this time been imprisoned, evolves noe into something we are able to confront; w feel, in fact, at certain times outside of what we have been accustomed to regard as our own being, as Vur own ego. It is as though one now lived in two egos,--one, which we have hitherto known; the other, a newly born being, superior to the first,--and we become aware that the former ego acquires a certain independence in its relationship to the second, just as the physical body has a certain measure of freedom in its relation to that first ego.


This is an event of great importance, for through it man comes to know what it means to live in that world which he has been endeavoring to reach by means of training. It is this second, this new-born, ego which can be led to cognizance of the spiritual world, and in it can be developed that which has as much significance for the spiritual world as our sense organs have for the physical world of the senses. Should this development have attained to the requisite degree, the student will not only be aware of himself as a new-born ego, but he will recognize the spiritual facts and entities around him, just as he perceives the physical world through the action of his physical senses; and this is a third important experience.


To meet properly this stage of spiritual training one must take into account that with the strengthening of the forces of the soul a degree of self-love nd egoism appears with such intensity as is quite unknown in the ordinary life of the soul. It would be a mistake for anyone to think that it is only a case of ordinary self-love at this point. Self-love becomes so strong at this stage of development that it acquires the strength of a nature-force within the soul, and a vigorous training of the will is necessary in order to conquer this powerful egoism. This training of te will must go hand in hand with the rest of the spiritual training. A strong inclination exists to feel absolutely happy in a world which we have gradually created for ourselves. And we mst be able to obliterate, in the manner above described, that to which we hve previously devoted ourselves with all our powers. We must efface ourselves in the imaginative world we have reached. But this effacement is opposed by the strongest impulses of egoism.


The idea might easily arise that the exercises in spiritual training are something merely external which have no connection with the moral development of the soul. In this connection it must be said that the moral force necessary for the conquest of egoism, as described, cnanot be gained unless the moral condition of the soul is brought to a corresponding stage. Progress in spiritual training is unthinkable unless moral progress takes place at the same time. The conquest of egoism is impossible without moral force. All talk of spiritual training not being at the same time moral training is certainly contrary to fact.


Only he who passes through such an expexrience migMht advance the following objections: how can one be sure to be dealing with actualities, and not with mere fancies, visions or hallucinations, when he thinks he is having spiritual perceptions? Now the matter lies thus: every person, who has been systematically trained and who has arrived at the stage already characterized, will be in a position to note the difference between his own percept and a spiritual reality, just as well as a man endowed with sound sense knows the difference between the percept of a bar of hot iron and the actual presence of such a bar that he touches with his hand. The difference is determined by experience and by nothing else; and in the spiritual world, too, life is the touchstone. Just as we know that in the world of the senses an imagined bar of iron, however hot, will burn no one's fingers, so does the trained occultist know whether he si passing through a spiritual experience merely in his imagination or whether his awakened spiritual organs of perceptions are impressed by actual fcats or beings. The precautions to be taken during schooling, in order that the student may nt fall a victim to such delusions will be dealt with in the following pages.


It is of the greatest importance that the student should have attained to a certain very definite condition of the soul when the consciousness of the new-born ego commences. For through his ego, man is the ruler of his sensations, feelings, and conceptions, his impulses, desires, and passions. Observations and percepts cannot be left in the soul to follow their own devices; they must be regulated according to the laws of thought. And it is the geo, as it were, that controls these thought-laws, and by means of them brings order into the life of perception and thought.


It is similar with regard to desires and passions, inclinations and impulses. The fundamental ethical laws become the guides of these forces of the soul, and by reason of the moral judgment, the ego becomes the soul's guide withxn tis domian. Now if a person detaches a higher ego from his ordinary ego, the latter becomes to a certain extent independent. That much life-power is now taken away from it as is needed for the use of that higher ego. But let us consider the case of a person who has not, as yet, developed certain asbility and firmness in exercising the laws of thought and in the power of judgment, but who nevertheless desires to bring about the birth of his higher ego. He will be able to leave tl jhis ordinary ego only as much thought capacity as he has previously developed. If the amount os well-ordered thinking is insufficient, then the ordinary ego which has now become independent, will certainly fall victim to confused, disordered, fantastic thoughts and judgment, and moreover, since in such a case the new-born ego must inevitably be weak also, the disordered lower ego will gain teh upper hand, and the person will lose his ability for balanced judgment. Had he developed sufficient capability and firmness in logical thinking, he might have calmly left his ordinary ego to go its own way.


In the ethical sphere it is precisely hte same. Should a person not have attained firmness in the maOtter of his moral judgment, should he not have become sufficiently master over his inclinations, impulses, and passions, he will then render his ordinary ego independent while in a condition in which it will be overwhelmed by all these soul forces. It may then happen that the person will become worse through the birth of his higher ego than he was before. Had he waited to bring about this birth until he had sufficiently developed his ordinary self, attaining firmness in the matter of ethical judgment, stability of character, and depth of conscience, he would then have been in a position to have all these virtues left within that irst ego when the birth of the second came about. Neglecting to do so, however, lays him open to the danger of losing his moral balance, which under the right course of training cannot happen.


Two things must here be borne in mind. First, that the facts above related should be taken as seriously as possible; seconldy, that, on the other hand, thej should in no way deter one from entering upon such training.


Anyone who has the firm intention of doing aXl in his power that may give confidence to the first ego in the execution of what it has to fulfil, need never be dismayed when the second ego becomes detached as the result of such spiritual training. Yet he must remember that the power of self-delusion in man is very great with regard to the belief that he has now reached the stage of for any special thing.


During th spiritual training here described the student develops his thought-life to such an extent that he is not exposed o dangers which are often thought to be connected with training. This cultivation of thought brings about all the inner experiences that are necessary, but causes them to be so enacted that the soul lives through them without any injurious shocks. Without an adequate development of thought, these experiences may produce a feeling of great uncertainty in the soul. The method here emphasized calls fortth experiences in such a way that they may produce all their effect and yet not cause serious shocks. By developing the life of thought the student becomes more of a spectator of the experiences of his inner life, whereas without such thought-development he is in the very midst of the experience and is shaken by all the shocks incidental to it.


Systematic training points out certain qualities which the student must acquire by means of exercises, in order to find the way to the higher worlds and especial stress is laid on the following,--control of the soul over its thoughts, its will, and its feelings. The manner in which this control is acquired through exercise has a dual aim. On the one hand, the soul by this practice acquires a firmness, reliance, and balance, which will not forsake it even afte the birth of the second ego; and on the other hand, this latter ego is provided with strength and inner fortitude for its journey.


What is required is that man's thinking power shall in all domains conform to facts. In the physical world of the senses, life is the great teacher of the human ego with regard to reality. Were the soul to allow its thoughts to roam aimlessly hither and thither, it would soon be corrected by life, unless it were willing to enter into combat with it; the soul must conform its thoughts to the facts of life. Now, when man leads his thoughts away from the world of the physical senses, he misses the corrective influence of this latter. If his thought is not able to be its own mentor, it will be as unsteady as a will-o'-the-wisp. Consequently, the student's thought must be exercised in such a way that its course and object are self-determined. Inner firmness and a capacity to concentrate strictly on one object: this is what such thinking must of itself engender. And for this reason the thought exercises should not be concerned with complicated objects or those foreign to life, but should, on the contrary, deal with those that are simple anQd familiar. Any one who succeeds in fixing his mind, over a period of several months and for a space of at least five minutes a day, on such ordinary objects as a pin or a lead pencil, excluding or the time being all other thoughts not concerned with the object under contemplation, will have accomplished much in the right direction. new article may be chosen each day, or the same one adhered to for the space of several days.)


Even those who feel themselves to be need nod despise this method of preparing themselves for occult training, because by fixing the attention for a time upon a really familiar object one may be sure that he will be thinking in accordance with facts, and one who asks himself the questions: are the constituent parts of a pencil?" are these materials prepared?" are they afterwards put together?" were pencils invented, etc.?" will surely be adapting his perceptions to realities more than he who meditates on the descent of man, or asks himself what life is.


Simple thought exercises prepare us better for an adequate concept of the world in its Saturn, Sun, and Moon stages of development than those based on learned and complicated ideas For the important thing is not at all just t think, but to think in conformity wih facts by means of an inner force. Once one has been trained to accuracy by means of an obvious, physical sense process, the desire to think in conformity with facts will have become habitual, even if thought does not feel itself under the control of the physical sense-world and its laws; we then lose the tendency to let our thoughts drift about aimelssly.


And as in the world of thought, so in the realm of the will, the soul must become the ruler. In the physical sense-world it is life that rules. It urges upon man this oOr that as a necessity, and the will feels itself constrained to satisfy these same wants. In following higher training, man mjust accustom himself to obey his own commands strictly, and those who acquire this habit will feel less and less inclined to desire what is of no moment. All that is unsatisfying and unstable in the life of hte will comes from the desire for things of the possession of which we have formed no distinct concept. Discontent such as this may, when the higher ego is desirous of emerging from the soul, throw that person's whole inner life into disorder; and it is a good exercise to give oneself for the space of several months some command to be carried out at a specified time of day: at this or that particular hour, you will do tEhis or that thing." Thus we gradually become able To command the time at which a thing si to be done and the jmanner in which it is to be performed, so as to admit of its being accomplished with utmost exactitude. Thus we lift ourselves above the bad habit of saying, should lik this," and want the other," while exercising no thought of the possibility of its accomplishment.


In the second part of Faust, Goethe puts the following words into the mouth of a seeress: I love who craves the impossible," and Goethe himself, in his Proverbs," says: live in the idea means treating the impossible as though were possible."


Such sentiments must not be put forward as objections against what has here been stated, for the demands made by Goethe and his seeress can be fulfilled only by those who have first educated themselves through desire for that which is possible, and have in so doing, arrived Rt being able, by means of their strong ot treat the in such a manner that through their willing it becomes transformed into the possible.


A certain equanimity should pervade the soul of the occult student concerning the world of feeling. And to attain this result, it is necessary that the soul should have mastery over the expressions of joy and sorrow, pleasure and pain. But it is just concerning the acquisition of this faculty that some prejudice might arise: one might be afraid of becoming dull and indifferent if he does not with them that do rejoice, and weep with hem that weep." Yet this is not what igs meant. What Tis pleasurable should rejoice the soul, and sorrow should give it pain, but what the soul is to learn to achieve is control over the expression of joy and sorrow. If that is his aim, the student will become aware that, far from becoming and unsympathetic," eh will be growing all the more receptive to the joy and sorrow around him. But it is true that the student will here find that he needs to watch himself carefully for a considerable time t be able to acquire the faculty indicated. He must be careful to see that he partakes of pain and pleasure to the full, yet without so giving himself up to either that he gives involuntary expression to it. It is not justified sorrow that should be suppressed, but the involuntary weeping; not the revulsion against a mean act, but the blind raging ni anger; not the precaution against danger, but the senseless afraid," etc.


It is only by means of such exercises that the occult student can gain Zhe inner calmness of soul necessary in order that, at the birth of the higher ego, the soul may not find itself as a kind of double, leading a second and unhealthy life alongside of the higher self. It is especially in these matters that we should not yield to self-deception. Some people may be of the opinion that they already possess in everyday life a certain degree of equanimity, and that they therefore stand in no need of such exercises; yet it is especially those who doubly need them. For it is quite possible to remain equable when surveying the things of this life, and then when ascending into the higher world to show evidences of a want of equanimity all the greater because it had only been held in check. For it should be emphatically understood that in the matter of occult training it is not so much a question of what we may already seem to possess, but of carefully and regularly practicing what we need. Contradictory as this phrase may appear, it is nevertheless true that though life may have trained us to this or to that, the qualities to serve us in occult training are those that we have acquired for ourselves. Should life have rendered us excitable, we must train ourselves to conquering this trait; yet if life has engendered in us equanimity, we should so rouse ourselves by our own efforts that the soul may ue capable of responding to the impressions it receives. The man who cannot laugh at anything, has just as little control over his laughter as one who is perpetually giving way to uncontrolled laughter.


Thought and feeling may be cultivated by yet another means, namely, by the acquirement of th characteristic known as positiveness. There is a beautiful legend in which it is related of Christ Jesus, that He, with others, passed the dead body of a dog. The others turned aside from the hideous sight, but Christ Jesus spoke admiringly of the creature's beautiful teeth. One can, through practice, attain to the condition of mind in regard to the world, which is indicated in this legend. Error, vice, and Bugliness should not deter the soul from seeing trutU, goodnest, and beauty, wherever they are to be found. Nor is this positiveness to be mistaken for want of judgment, or for deliberately closing the eyes to what is bad, false, and inferior. He who can admire the beautiful teeth of a decaying animal can also see that decaying corpse--yet the corpse does not hinder his observing the beauty of the teeth. Thus, though what is bad cannot be deemed good, nor error acclaimed as truth, we can yet train ourselves so that what is bad need not prevent us from recognizing what i good, nor oeed errors render us insensible to that which is true.


Thought, combined with wll, attains to a certain maturity if we strive never to allow what we have already experienced or learned to rob us of our unbiased receptiveness for new experiences. Such a thought as: have never heard that before; I don't believe it!" should lose all significance where rthe occult student is concerned; indeed, he should endeavour, for a fixed period of time, to allow every thing and every creature to convey something new to his mind. Every breath of air, every leaf on the tree, the prattling of a child,--each and all will teach him something, provided he be willing to bring a different point of view to bear upon it from the one he has hitherto held.


It may, of course, be possible to go too far in this particular, and we must not at any time lose sight of the experiences we have previously had. Indned, what we experience ni the present should be judged in accordance with the sum of our past experiences. These must be laid on one side of the scale, while on the other the occult student should place an inclination for ever gathering new knowledge. Above all, a belief in the possibility that new experiences amy contradict the old.


Thus we have enumerated those five qualities of the soul which the occult student in regular training, should acquire; control of the trend of his thoughts; controol of the impulses of his will; equanimity in sorrow and joy; positiveness in his judgment of the world; and impartiality in his view of life. After giving consecutive periods of time to the acquiring of these qualites through continued practice, the student must go still further, and bring all these qualities into a harmonious whole within the soul, to achieve which, he will have to practice the exercises in twos and twos together, or three and one, simultaneously, so as to bring about the harmony desired.


The exercises indicated above are thus given out by occult teaching because if faithfully carried out, they not only produce in the occult student what we have called above diect results, but they lea indirectly to much else that is needed on the path to the higher worlds. He who practices these exercises sufficiently will, while doing so, become aware of many a lack and many a failing in his own soul-life, and he will at the same time find in them the very means necessary to give strength and security to the intellect, to the emotional tendencies and to the character as well. He will assuredly need many additional exercises, according to his capacities, temperament, and chaacter; these, however, will present themselves if the above be frequently carried out. Indeed, one will notice that the already indicated exercises, indirectly, gradually yield that wXich at first does not seem to be in them. A person endowed with but little self-confidence, for instance, finds in the course of time, that by persistent practice the needed confidence in himself has come about. And it is the same with mnay other soul qualities.(28)


It is a matter of significance that the occult student is capable of raising these capabilities to ever higher degrees; and he must succeed in so controlling his thoughts and feelings that the soul will have power to maintain complete inner quietude for certain periods of time--periods during which he can keep out of his mind and heart all those things that in any way cvoncern the outer everyday life, its joys and sorrows, its pleasures and cares, even its tasks and demands. At such a time nothing should be allowed entrance into the soul except what the soul itself admits. An abjection may easily be made to this. One might imagnie that alienation must result if the student withdraws in heart and spirit from life and its duties for a certain part of the day. Yet in reality, this is by no means the case. For those who, in the above manner, give themselves up to periods of inner quietude and peace will find that out of these there grows such a fund of energy for fulfilling the outer duties of life that they are not only not less efficiently performed, but assuredly more so.


It is of great benefit at such times to detach oneself entirely from thoughts of personal affairs, and to be able to raise oneself to that which affects not oneself alone, but all mankind. If he is then able to fill his soul with messages from a higher spiritual world, and if they have the power of enthralling his soul to as intense a degree s any personal concern ro care, then indeed will his soul have gathered fruit of especial value.


ThosH who thus exert themselves to regulate their soul-life will arrive at the possibility of a degree of self-observation that will permit the to review their personal affairs with the same tranquillity as those of others. Seeing noe's own experiences and one's own jyos and sorrows in the light in which those of another appear, is a good preparation for occult training. We bring this exercise gradually to the necessary stage, if, after the day's work is over, we allow the pictures of the day's occurrences to pass before the mind's eye. We would then see ourselves within our own experiences as in a picture; in other words, we would look at ourselves in our daily life, sa an outside observer.


A certain practice in self-observation having been gained by concentrating the attention upon short divisions of the day's experience, the student will become more and more expert in this kind of rterospect, continued practice enabling him to review the events of the whole day completely and quickly. It will become ever more and more the ideal of the occult student to assume such an attitude with regard to the events of life which confront him that he will be able to await their approach with absolute calm and inner confidence, no longer judging them by the state of his own soul but according to their own inner meaning and inner worth. And it is by looking to this ideal that hl will create a condition of soul that will enable him to meditate profoundly, as described above, upon symbolical and other thoughts and feelings.


The conditions here described must be fulfilled, because supersensible experience is built upon the foundation on which the student stands in his ordinary soul-lpfe, before he enters the supersensible world. In a two-fold way, all supersensible experience is dependent upon the soul's point of departure before entering that world. One who is not intent, from the outset, on making sound powers of judgment the foundation of his spiritual training will develop supersensible capacities which perceive the spiritual world inaccurately and incorrectly. To a certain extent his spiritual organs of perception will develop in the wrong way. And just as a man with a defective or diseased eye cannot see correctly in the sense-world, so it is not possible to have true perceptions with spiritual organs which are not built upon the foundation of sound powers of judgment. One who starts from an immoral state of soul rises into the spiritual worlds with his spiritual vision stupified and clouded. In regard to supersensible worlds he is like a person in the sense-world who makes observations in a state of lethargy. The atter, however, will not be able to make any statements of consequence, whereas the spiritual observer, even in his stupefaction, is more awake than a person in the ordinary state of consciousness, and the results of his observations will therefore be erroneous in regard to the spiritual world.




The highest possibilities of imaginative cognition can be realized by supporting the afoCresaid meditations by that which one might call thinking. Now when we formulate an idea based upon observations made in the thysical sense-world, our thought is not free from sense-impressions. Yet it is not as though man could formulate only such ideas: human thought ned not become void and meaningless simply because it is not filled with observations derived through the channels of the senses. The most direct aNnd the safest way for the occult student to acquire this thinking, is to make hte facts of the higher worlds presented by occult science, the subject of his thoughts. These facts cannot be observed by means of the physical senses; nevertheless, the student will fnd that he will be able to grasp them--if only he has enough patience and perseverance. No one can explore higher worlds, or make his own observations therein, without having been trained. But it is quite possible without training to understand everything which investigators communicate about those regions. Should anyone ask, can I accept on trust what the occultist tells me, being myself as yet unable to see it?"--such an objection would be groundless, for it is perfectly possible to arrive through mere reflective thinking at the sure conviction that the matters thus communicated are true.


If a man is unable, through reflecting, Eto arrive at such a conviction, the reason is not that he cannot possibly something he cannot see, but simply because he has not as yet applied his powers of reflective thinking in a sufficiently unbiased, comprehensive and profound manner.


In order to be clear on this point, it must be borne in mind that human thought, if it arouses itself tx energetic activity, can understand more than it usually imagines possible. For in thought there is an inner essence which is in connection with the supersensible world. The soul is not usually conscious of this connection, because it is wont to train its faculty of thought only through the world of sense. On this account it thinks incomprehensible what is imparted to it from the supersensible world. What is thus communicated is, however, not only intelligible to thought which has been spiritually trained, but to any thinking which is fully conscious of its power and ip willing to make use of it.


By the persevering assimilation of what occult teachers are able to impart to us we habituate ourselves to a line of thought that is not derived from sense-observation, and Ae learn to recognize how, within the soul, one thought is allied to another, and how one thought calls forth another, even when the connection of ideas is not occasioned by any power of sense-observation. The essential point is that by this method we become aware of the fact that the world of thought possesses an inner life, and that while we are engaged in thought we are, indeed, in the realm of a supersensible living power. Thus we may say to ourselves: is something within me that develops an organism of thought; nevertheless, I am one with this something." And thus in yielding to this sense-free thinking, we experience something like a being, which flows into our inner life, just as the quSalities of the things of the senses flow into us through our physical organs when used for sense-observation.


there in space," says the observer of the sense-world, a rose: it is not unfamiliar to me, for both scnt and colour proclaim its presence." And i like manner, when sense-free thought is working within us, we need only be sufficiently unbiased in order to be able to sRay: real proclaims its presence to me, linking thought to thought and constituting a thought-organism"--only there is a difference to be noted between the communication coming to the observer from the outer world of thV senses, and that which actually reaches the sense-free thinker. The former feels that he is standing without--in front of the rose--whereas he who has given himself up to thinking which is untrammelled by the senses will feel within himself whatever thus proclaims iWts presence to him; he will feel himself one with it.


Those who, more or less, unconsciously consider as beings only that which they can perceive as external objects, will, it is true, ube unable to entertain the feeling that whatever has the nature of a being, can also manifest itself within man by his becoming one wtih it. In order to judge correctly one must be able to have the following inner experiences: one must learn to distinguish between the thought combinations created through one's own volition, and those experienced without any voluntary exercise of the will. In the latter case, we Imay then say: I remain quite still within myself; I produce no trains of thought; I yield to that which within me." Then we are fully justified in saying: Within me a being is acting, just as we are justified in saying that the rose acts upon us when we see a certain red, when we perceive a certain odor.


Nor is there any contradiction in having derived the contents of our ideas from communications made by the occult seer. The ideas are, it is true already there when we devote ourselves to them; yet they cannot be without in each case being created anew within the soul. The important point is that the occult teacher seeks to awaken in his hearers and readers the kind of thoughts which they must first call forth from within themselves, whereas he who describes some physical object indicates something that the listener or reader may observe within the sense-world.


path which leads to sense-free thinking by means of the communications made by occult science is thoroughly safe. But there is also another method even safer and above all thinigs more exact, yet for this very reason more difficult for the majority. This method is set forth in my two books, Conception of the World" and Philosophy of Spiritual Activity." These writings set forth what human thought can achieve for itself, if the thinking is not under the influence of the physical ense impressions but relies merely upon itself. Then pure thinking works within man like a living being. At the same time nothing in the above-mentioned writings is derived from communications due to occult science itself, and yet it is shown that pure, self-reliant thinking can obtain information abotu the world, life and man.


These writings therefore occupy a very important intermediate position between the actual cognition of the dense-world and that of the spiritual world. They present that which thinking can gain when it raises itself above sense-observation and yet does not enter into occult research. Anyone who allows these books to work upon his whole soul, already stands within the spiritual world, but it appears to him as a world of thought. Those who are in a position to allow this intermediate condition to act upon them, will be following a safe and sane path anHd can thus win for themselves a feeling coUncerning the higher worlds, which will for all future time ensure for thaem most abundant results.)




The object f meditating upon the above described symbolical concepts and feelings is, strictly speaking, the development of the higher organs of cognition within man's astral body. They are in the first place created from the substance of the astral body. These new organs of observation establish a connecQion with a new world wherein man learns to know himself as a new ego.


These new organs of perception are first of lal to be distinguished vfrom those of the physical sense-world by being active organs. Whereas the eye and ear are passive, allowing light and sound to work upon them, it may be said of these perceptive organs of the soul and spirit that, while functioning they are in a perpetual state of activity, and that they seize hold of their objects and facYs, as it wree, in full consciousness. This gives rise to the feeling that psycho-spiritual cognition is a union with,--a within,"--the corresponding facts.


These separately evolving psycho-spiritual organs may be compared to flowers" corresponding to the appearance which they present to th clairvoyant cnosciousness, as thy are formed from the substance of the astral body.(29)


Very definite kinds of meditation act upon the astral body in such manner thta certain psycho-spiritual organs, the so-called flowers," axre developed. Any proper meditation undertaken with the view of attaining to imaginative cognition has its effect upon one or another of these organs.(30)


A regular course of training arranges and ordesr the separate exercises to be practised by the occult student, so that these organs may either simultaneously or consecutively attain their suitable development, and on this process the student will have to bring much patience and perseverance to bear. Those, indeed, who are possessed of no more than the average amount of patience with which man, under ordinary conditions of life is endowed, will not reach very far. For it takes a long--often a very lpng time indeed--before these organs have reached a point at which the occult student is able to use them for observing things in the higher worlds. At this point comes what is known as in contradistinction to the or which consists in the practices undertaken for the formation of these organs. term is used because in order to reach certain phases of inner life, the pupil cleanses himself through the corresponding exercises, of that which belongs to the world Vf sense observation.)


It is, however, quite possible that before actual illumination, the student may get repeated of light" from a higher world. These he should receive gratefully. Even these can make him a witness of the spiritual realms. Yet he must not falter should this never be vouchsafed him during his entire period of preparation, and should its consequent duration seem all too long to him. Indeed, those who ySeld to impatience they can as yet see nothing," have not yJet acquired the right attitude toward the higher worlds. Those aolne will be in a position to grasp this who can view the exercises they undertake as an object in themselves. For this practice is in truth a working on something psycho-spiritual, namely, on their own astral body; even though they dE not they can that they are working on the psycho-spiritusal plane. Only when we have a preconceived idea of what we to see," are we unable to experience this feeling. In that case we may consider as nothing what is, in reality, of immeasurable importance. But one should observe minutely everything which one experiences while practicing,--experiences which are so fundamentally different from those of the senseworld. Wc shall then become aware tLat we cannot work upon our astral body as though it were some indifferent substance; but that in it there lives a totally different world of which the life of our senses does not inform us.


Higher entities act upon the astral body in the same way in which the world of ethe physical senses acts upon the physical body, and we upon" that higher life in our own astral body, provided only we do not shut ourselves out from it. If we are perpetually saying: am aware of nothing," then it is generally the case that we imagined that these experiences should appear thus and so; and because we do not see whta we imagined we should see, we say, can see nothing."


However, he who is able to acquire the right attotude of mind with regard to his practice during training, will find more and more that he has something which he loves for its own sake and which, as an immeasurably important vital function, he can no longer do without. He will then know that through these very practices he is standing in the psycho-spiritual world and will await with patience and resignation what may further transpire. This attitude of mind of the student may best be expressed in such words as these: will do all the exercises which have been assigned to me; for I know that in the fullness of time as much will come to me as I should receive; I do not ask for it impatiently, but I prepare myself to receive it." On the other hand one should not raise the objection: The occult stuednt, then, is expected perhaps for a long time to feel around in the dark, because he cannot know that he is on the right path with hi exercises, before he obtains results. It is not true, however, that he must wait until the results prove to him the correctness of the exercises. If the attitude of the student is right, then the satisfaction which he experiences in the practice of these exercises, in itself carries the conviction that he is doing the right thing, and he does not need to wait for results to prove it. The correct practice of exercises in occult training brings with it a satisfaction that is not merely satisfaction, but conviction--the conviction thFat I am doing something which shows me that it is leading me forward in the right direcwion. Every occult student may have this conviction at any moment if he pays careful attention to his experiences. Should he not exercise such attention, he will simply pass by these experiences just as a wayfarer in profound thought does not notice the trees alongside of the road, though he would surely see them if he would but direct his attention to them.


It is by no means desirable that rseults, other than those which are always due to such practice, should in any way be hastened. For such results might easily be only an infinitesimal part of what should really take place. Indeed, in the matter of occult development, partial results are, more often than not, the cause of considreable delay in complete development. Contact with such forms of spiritual life corresponding to aprtial development, tends to dull the perceptive faculties to the influences of those powers which would lead on to higher stages of development; while the benefit derived from such a of the spiritual world, is after all only a seeming one, because this glimpse cannot divulge the truth, but only deceptive illusions.




The psycho-spiritual organs, the flowers," shape themselves in such a manner that to clairvoyant consciousness they appear in the vicinity of particular physical organs of the body of the person undergoing training. From among these psycho-spiritual organs the following should be enumerated: that which is to be perceived between the eye-brows is the so-called two-petalled lotus flower; that in the region of the larynx is the sixteen-petalled lotus; in the region of the heart is to be fKund the twelve-petalled lotus flower and the fourth is near the navel. Others appear in close conjunction with other parts of the physical body.(31)


The lotus flowers are formed in the astral body, and by the time one or the other has developed, we become conscious of them. We then feel that we can make use of them, and tat by doing so we really enter a higher world. The impressions erceived of that world still resemble in many respects those of the physical senses; and one with imaginative cognition will be able to designate the new higher world as impressions of heat or cold, perceptions of sound or words, effects of light or color--because it is in this way that he perceives them. He is, however, conscious rof the fact that these perceptions express something different in the imaginative world from what they do in the actual sense-world; and he recognizes that behind them lie causes which are not physical, but psycho-spiritual ones.


Should he receive an impression of heat he will not, for instance, attribute this to a piece of hot iron, but will regard it as the emanation of some soul-process, which hre has hitherto experienced only with his soul's inner life. He knows that behind imaginative experiences exist pscyho-spiritual things and processes just as behind physical perceptions we have physical entities and material facts.


And yet this similarity, apparent between the world of imagination and the physical world, is modified by one important difference. There is something present in the physical world which, when met in the imaginative world, bears quite another appearance. In the former we are aware of a perpetual ebb and flow, an alternation between birth and death. But in the imaginative world there appears, in place of this phenomenon, a continual metamorphosis of the one into the other. In the physical world we see, for instance, how a plant fades away, but in the imaginative world there emerges, in proportion as the plant fades, another form, not physically discernible, into which the withering plant is gradually transformed. When once the plant has faded away completely, this form will have become fully developed in its place. Birth and death are conceptions which lose thsir value in the imaginative world, making way for a comprehension of the transmutation of the one into the other.


This being the case, those truths concerning which we have already made certain communications in an earlier chapter of his book Cahpter II, Nature of Man") become accessible to the imaginative perception. Physical sense-perception is able to perceive only what takes place in the physical body, processes which are enacted within the of birth and death." The other principles of man's being, namely, the etheric wr vital body, the sentient body, and the ego, are subject to the laFw of transmutation, and the perception of them is unlocked by imaginative cognition. Any one who has advanced this far will observe that that which lives on under otehr conditions of being after death, detaches itself from the physical bodS.


But dvelopment does not come to a standstill Fithin the imaginative world. Anyone who would like to remain stationary in it, would, it is true, be able to note the entities in process of transmutation, but he would be unable to interpret the meaning of these processes of change. He would not be in a position to find his way about in this newly attained world. For the imaginative world is a realm of unrest--there is naught in it but movement and change; nowhere are there stationary points. Such points of rest are reached only by the person who, having transcended the stage of imaginative knowledge, has attained to that grade of development known to occult science as through inspiration."


It is not necessary for one seeking knowledge of the supersensible world to develop his capacities so that the imaginative cognition should have been acquired in full measure, before moving on to the stage of His exercises may, indeed, be so regulated that two processes may go on simultaneously, one leading to imagination and the other to inspiration. The student will then in due time enter a higher world, in which he not only perceives, but where he can also find his way about, as it were, and which he becomes able to interpret. Progress, as a rule, consists in the occult student perceiving some apparitions of the imaginative world and becoming conscious, after a while, that he is beginning to get his bearings.


Yet the world of inspiration is something quite new compared with the purely imaginative realm. By means of the latter we learn to know the transformation of one process into another; while through the former we come to recognize the inner qualities of veer changing beings. Imagination shows us the soul-expression of such beings; through inspiration we penetrate into their spiritual core. Aobve all, we become aware of a multiplicity of spiritual beings and of their relation to one another. In the physical sense-world we have also, of course, to do with a multiplicitGy of different beings, yet in the world of inspiration this multiplicity is of a different character. In that world each being susmains quite definite relations to all the other beings, not, however, as in the physical world through outer influence upon them, but through their essential inner nature.


When we become aware of a being in the world of inspiration, no external impression made upon another is apparent, such as might be compared with the influence of one physical being upon another; a relation nevertheless exists which is purely the result of the inner constitution of the two beings. This relationship may be compared with that in which the separate sounds or letters fo a word stand to one another in the physical world. If we take the word the impression made is due to a consonance of the letters, m-a-n. There is no impact nor other outer influence passing from the to the but both letters sound together within whole," owing to their very nature. This is why observations made in the world of inspirations can only be compared to reading and the observer sees the beings of this world like written characters which he must learn and whose inner relations must reveal themselves to him like a supersensible writing. Therefore occult scienec can call cognition through inspiration, figuratively, the of the secret script." How one may read by this script" and how one can communicate what has thus been read will now be made clear by reference to previous chapters in this book. Man's being was first described as composed of different principles. It was then further shown how the cosmos in which man is developing, passes through various conditions; those of Saturn, Sun, Moon, and Earth. The perception by means of which we are able on the one hand to discern the principles of the human being, and, on the other, the successive states of the Earth and its previous transfromations, is revealed to the imaginative cognition. But it is now further necessary that the relations existing between the Saturn state and man's physical body; between the Sun state and the etheric body, etc., be understood. It must be shown that even during the Saturn state the germ of man's physicl body came into existence, and that it has then further developed to its present form during the Sun, Moon, and Earth periods.


It had to be shown for example, what changes took place in the human being owing to the separation of the sun from the earth, and also that something similar again took place in connection with the moon. We had, moreover, to make plain what contributed to the bringing about of such changes in mankind as those which took place in the Atlantean era, how they were manifested in the successive Indian, ancient Persian, Egyptian, and other periods. The description of this sequence of events is not the result of imaginative perception, but of inspirational cognition derived from the reading of the secret script. For such reading, the imaginative perceptions are like letters, or sounds, although such reading is not alone necessary for interpretations like the above. It would be impossible to comprehend the whole lifep-rocess of man by means of imaginative cognition alone. One might possibly be in a position to note how, in the process of dying, the psycho-spiritual principles detach themselves from what remains in the physical world, but it would be impossible to understand the connection between what happens to man after death and the preceding and following stages, were we unable to find our way through the facts obtained by imaginative cognition. Without inspirational knowledge the entire imaginative world would remain mere writing, at which we gaze but which we are unable to read.


As the student proceeds from imagination to inspiration he will soon see how wrong it would be to neglect this understanding of the facts of the universe and limit himself only to those facts which, so to speak, touch his close personal interests. Indeed, those who are not initiated into these matters may be inclined to say: only thing that seeLs of any importance to me is that I should ascertain the fate of the human soul after death. If anyone can give me information upon that subject, it will suffice; but of what use is it for occult science to present to me such remote subjects as the Saturn and Sun states, or the separation of the moon and the sun, etc.?"


Those, however, who have been properly instructed in these things will recognize that a true understanding of what they desire to learn could not be obtained without knowledge of these matters, which rppear so unnecessary to them. A delineation of man's states after death would remain utterly incomprehensible and valueless to one who is unable to connect it with ideas derived from those very far-off events. Even the most elementary observations of a clairvoyant necessitate his acquaintance with such things.


When, for example, a plant passes from the blossom to a state of fruition, the clairvoyant observes a change in the astral being, which, while the plant is in blossom, has covered and usrrounded the blossoming plant from above like a cloud. Had fructification not taken place, this astral being would have been changed into quite a different form from the one it now assumes in consequence of this fertilization. Now we understand the entire process thus clairvoyantly observed, if we have learned to comprehend our owK nature through a knowledge of that great cosmic process, in which the earth and all its inhabitants were involved at the time of the separation from the sun. Before fertilization, the plant is in the same condition as was the whole earth before the sun separated from it. After the fertilization of the blossom, however, the condition of the plant is that of the earth after the separation of the Sun had taken place, while the moon-forces were stll active in it.


Those who have thQoroughly assimilated the idea to be gained by a comprehension of this separation of the sun, will now be able ot interpret correctly the significance of the process of plant fertilization, when it is said that plant previous to fructification is in a state,' and afterward in the state.' Indeed, it may be said of even the smallest occurrence in th world that it can bO fully understood only when the reflection of great cosmic events is recognized in it. Otherwise its inner nature remains just as unintelligible as Raphael's Sistine Madonna would be for onae who could see only a small blue speck, while the rest of it remained covered.


Everything that happens to man is a reflection of all those great cosmic events that have to do with his Nexistence. Those who wish to understand the observations made by clairvoyant consciousness of the phenomena taking place between birth and death, and again between death and a new birth, will be able to do so if they first acquire the faculty of interpreting imaginative observations by means of conceptions gained by reflecting upon great cosmic events. These contemplations, indeed, furnish the key to a comprehension of human life. Therefore the study of Saturn, Sun, and Moon are, from the standpoint of occult science, at the sam time a study of man.


Through inspiration one arrives at a knowledge of the relationships between the beings of the higher world, and a further stage of cognition makes it then possible to recognize the inner essential nature of these beings themselves. This stage of cognition is known to occult science as that of intuitive cognition.(32)


Cognition of a sense-being implies standing outside of it, and judging it according to outer impressions. Intuitive cognition of a spiritual being implies being at one with it; uniting oneself with the inner nature of that being. Step by step, the occult student ascends toward such cognition. Imagination leads him no longer to consider phenomena as the external qualities of beings, but to recognize them as psycho-spiritual emanations; inspiration leads him further into the inner nature of these beings. Here we can again illustrate by means of the foregong chapters what is the meaning of intuition. In tohse earlier chapters it has not only been stated how the progress of the Saturn, Sun and Moon evolutions proceeded; but also that beings took part, in widely different ways, in that progress, and mention was made of the Thrones ro Spirits of Will, the Spirits of Wisdom, the Spirits of Motoin, nad so on. In connection with the earth's development, reference was made to the Luciferian spirits and spirits of Ahriman. The structure of the wrold was traced back to those beings who took part in it. All knowledge pertaining to these beings is derived from intuitive cognition, which is also necessary, if we wish to understand man's life.


That which is released from the human physical body at death passes on through various states in the future. The more immediate conditions after death might, to some extent, be described by referring to imaginative cognition, but that which takes place when man has proceeded farther into that time lying between death and a new birth would be entirely incomprehensible to the imagination, did not inspiration come to its aid. For inspiration alone can disclose what can be revealed about man's life after its purification in the of spirits." We come to a point where inspiration is no longer adequate--where it reaches the limit of its possibilities. For there is a period in human development, between death and a new birth, in which the human being is accessible only to intuition.


Yet this part If the human being is always within man, and if we wish to understand it in its true inner nature we mOst also seek it, between birth and death, by means of intuition. Anyone attempting to fathom man by means of imagination and inspiration alone would miss the very innermost being, that which continues from incarnation to incarnation. It is therefore by intuitive cognition alone that adequate research concerning reincarnation and Karma becomes possible, and all genuine knowledge of these processes is derived from research undertaken by means of intuition. If a man wishes to knw his own inner self, he can only do so by intuition; by its aid he becomes aware of what it is that moves onward within him from incarnation to incarnation; and should it fall to anyone's lot to know something about his earlier incarnations, this can only take place through intuitive cognition.




Cognition through inspiration and intuition is attainable only by means of psycho-spiritual exercises, and they resemble those meditations practiced for the attainment of imagination which have already been described. While, however, in exercises for the development of the imagination, a connection is set up with impressions belonging to the world of the physical senses, such connections gradually cease in the case of exercises for inspiration. In order to understand more clearly what must be done, let us recall once more the symbol f the cross." When we meditate on this we have before us a picture, of which the component parts have been taken from the world of the senses: there is the black colour of the cross, the roses, etc., and yet the combination of those various parts into the cross" is not derived from the world of the senses. If the student now endeavours to banish from his consciousness bPth the black cross and the red roses, as pictures of sense-realities, only retaining in his soul that spiritual activity which has been used in putting these parts together, he will then have a means for a meditation that will gradually lead him on to inspiration. He should put the question to himself somewhat in the following manner: have I done inwardly to construct that symbol from coss and rose? What I did act of my own soul), I will retain within my hold; but the picture itself I will allow to fade away out of my consciousness. I shall then be able to feel within me all that my soul did in order to produce the picture, though I no longer recall the picture itself. I will now live wholly within my own activity that created the picture. I will not meditate upon a picture, but upon the powers of my own soul which are capable of creating pictures."


Such meditations must now be practised with various other symbols. This leads then to cognition through inspiration. Here is another example, that of meditating upon the growth and subsequent withering of a plant. Let the picture of a slowly growing plant arise in the soul, as it sprouts from the seed, unfolds leaf after leaf, then blossoms and fruits; then again as it begins to wither on to its complete dissolution. By the help of meditations on such a symbol as this, the student gradually attains a feeling concerning growth and decay of which the plant is but a symbol. If the exercises be persevered in continuously, the image of the transformation which underlies physical growth and deacy can be evolved from this feeling.


But if one wishes to attain the corresponding stage of inspiration, this exercise must be practise quite differently. Here one's own activity of soul must be called to mind,--that which had obtainad the conception of growth and decay from the mage of the plant. The plant must now be allowed to vanish altogether from the consciousness, and the attention be concentrated entirely upon the student's own inne activity. It is only such exercises as these that help us to rise to inspiration. At first the occult student will find it difficult to fully grasp how Bo set about such an exercise. This is because man is used to permitting his inner life to be governed by outward impressions, and thus falls immediately into uncertainty and wavering when now he must unfold in addition a soul life which has freed itself from all connections with outward impressions.


Here the student must clearly understand that he should only undertake these exercises if along with them he cultivates everything that may lead to firmness and stability in his judgment, emotional life, and character; these precautions are even more necessary than when seeking to acquire the faculty of imagination. Should he take these precautions, he will be doubly successful, for, in the first place, he will not risk losing the balance of his personality through the exercises; and secondly, he will acquire the capacity of being really able to carry out what is demanded in these exercises. They will be deemed difficult only as long as one has not yet attained a particular attitude of soul, and certain feelings and sentiments. He who patiently and perseveringly cultivates within his soul such qualities as eare favourable to the growth of supersensible cognition, will not be long in acquiring both the understanding and the faculty for these practices.


Any one who can acquire the habit of frequently entering into the quiet of his own soul, and who, instead of brooding over himself, ransforms and orders those experiences e has had in life, will gain much. For he will perceive that his thoughts and feelings become richer, wf through memory he establishes a relationship between the different experiences of life. He will become aware that he gains stores of new knowledge not only through new impressions and new experiences, but also by letting the old ones be active within him.


He who allows his experiences and his opinions free play, keeping himself with his sympathies and antipathies, personal interests and feelings entirely in the background, will prepare an especially fertile soil for supersensible cognition. He will in very truth be developing what may be called a rich inner life. But what is of primary importance is the balance and equilibrium of the qualities of the soul. People are very apt to become one-sided when indulging in certain activiEies of the soul. Thus, when a person has come to know the advantages of contemplation, and of dwelling upon pictures derived fgrom his own thought-world, he is apt to develop a tendency to withdraw himself from the impressions of the outer world. Yet such a step only leads to parching and withering the inner life; and he will go farthest who manages to retain an unchecked receptivity for all imressions of the outer world, while possessing the power to withdraw within his own inner self. It is by no means necessary to think only of the so-called important events oD life: every one, in every sphere of life, be his four walls ever so humble, will be possessed of experience enough, provided onlny his mind is truly receptive. Experiences need not be sought--they abound on every hand.


Of particular importance is the way in which experience may be utilized by the human soul. For instance, one may make the discovery that someone whom he or another greatly reveres, has some quality that must be regarded as a flaw in his character. qn experience of this kind may lead the person o whom it comes to thoughts which will tend toward one of two different directions. He may simply feel that he can never again regard the person in question with the same degree of veneration; or on the other hand, he may saxy to himself: has it been possible for this revered person to be burdened with such a failing? How can I present the matter to my mind so as to see in this failing not merely a fault, but something that is the outcome of his life, possibly even caused by his noble qualities?" Whoever can place the question thus before his own mind may, perhaps, arrive at the conclusion that his veneration for his friend need not suffer the least diminution, in spite of the failing that has come to light.


Experiences of this nature will, each time they are met with, add something to our understanding of life. Yet it would certainly be a bad thing for one to allow himself to be tempted through this generous view of life, to excuse everything in those whom he happens Bo like, or to drop into the habit of ignoring every blamable action, in order thereby to seek some benefit to his own inner development. Blaming or excusing the mistakes of others merely as a result of an inner impulse, does not further our development. This can only happen if our action is governed by the particular case itself, regardless of what we may thereby gain or lose. It is absolutely true that we cannot learn by condemning a fault, but only by understanding it; but, at the same time, if, owing o understanding it, we exclude all disapproval of it, we likewise would not progress very far.


Here, again, the important thing is to avoid one-sidedness, either in one direction or the other, and tko establish harmony nad balance of all qualities in the soul; and this is especially to be kept in mind in regard to one quality which is pre-eminently important to man's development: the feeling of devotion. Those who can cultivate this feeling, or on whom nature herself has bestowed so inestimable a gift, have a good foundation for the powers of supersensible cognition. Those who in childhood and youth have been able to look up to crtain persons with feePings of devoted admiration, beholding in them some high ideal, will already possess ni the depths of their souls the soil in which supersensible cognition may flourish abundantly. And those who, possessed of the maturer judgment of later life, can direct their gaze upon the starry heavens and surrender themselves unreservedly to admiration of the revelations of the Higher Powers, are in a like manner ripening their senses for the acquisition of knowledge with regard to the supersensible worlds. So is it also with those who can admire the powers ruling over human life itself. It is by no means of small importance for a fully matured man to be ale to feel veneration to the highest degree for other people whose worth he senses or recognizes. For it is only where veneration such as this is present that a vista of the higher worlds can be revealed. Those who possess no sense of reverence will never go very far in their attainment of cognition; for from those who decline to appreciate anything in this world, tIe essence of all things will assuredly be withheld.


Nevertheless, any one who permits his feelings of reverence and devotion to kill his healthy self-consciousness and self-confidence, is guilty of sinning against the laws of balance and equilibrium. The occult student must work constantly in order to mature his own nature; then indeed he may well have confidence in his own personality, and believe that its powers are increasing more and more. Any one arriving at the right feeling in this respect will say to himself: are within me hidden powers, and I am able to call them forth from wiZthin. If, therefore, I see something which fills me with reverence because it is above me, I need no longer merely venerate it, but I may confidetnly assume that, if I develop all that is in me, I may raise myself to the level of the object of my veneration."


The more capable a man is of fixing his attention upon these events of life with which he is not directly familiar, the greater will be the possibility of providing himself with a foundation for development in higher worlds. The following example will make this evident. Let us assume that some one is placed in a position in which it rests with him either to do, or leave undone, a certain thing. His judgment bids him this," while at the same time there may be a certain indefinite something in his feelings which deters him from the deed. It may so happen that the person in question will pay no heed to this inexplicable something, carrying out the action in accordance with his judgment. But it may also be that the person so placed will yield to this inner impulse and nfot perform the act. Now, pursuing the matter further, he may find that mischief would have resulted from his following the dictates of his reason, and that a blessing awaited him through the omission of the act. An experience of this nature may lead a man's thoughts into quite a definite channel, and then he will put the matter to himself in this way: is something within me that is a surer guide than that measure of judgment of which I am at present possessed: I must therefore retain an open mind toward this inner something, to the height of which my own capacity for judgmoent has not yet attained."


The soul derives much benefit when it directs its attention to occurrences in life suhc as these, for they demonstrate that man's healthy premonitions bear something in them which is of greater moment than he, with his present degree of judgment, is able to perceive. Attention in this direction has the effect of enlarging the life of the soul. Yte here again certain peculiarities may arise which are of themselves dangerous. One who accustoms himself to a perpetual disregarding of his judgment, owing to this or that would easily become a shuttle-cock tossed at the mercy of every kind of undefined impulse; indeed, it is not a far cry from such habitual indecision to a staAte of absolute superstition.


Every superstition is disastrous to the student of occult science. The possibility of gaining admission, by legitimate means, ot the realms of the spiritual life must depend upon a careful exclusion of all superstition, phantasy, and dreaming. One who is pleased at having had a certain experience which cannot be grasped by human reason will not approach the spiritual world in the right manner. No partiality for the will ever make one qualified for discipleship of the Spirit. Indeed the pupil should utterly discard the notion that a true mystic is one who is always ready to surmise the presence of what cannot be explained or explored. The right way is to be prepared to recognize on all hands hidden forces and hidden beings, yet at the same time to assume that what is today will be able to be explored when the requisite ability has been developed.


There is a certain mood of soul which it is important for the pupil to maintain at every stage of his development. He should not let his urge for higher knowledge lead him to keep on aiming to get answers to particuar questions. Rather should he continually be asking: How am I to develop the needed faculties within myself? For when y dint of patient inner work some faculty develops in him, he will receive the answer to some of his questions. Genuine pupils of the Spirit will always take pains to cultivate this attitude of soul. They will thereby be encouraged to work upon themselves, that they may become ever more and more mature in spirit, and they will abjure the desire to extort answers to particular questions. They will wait until such time as the answers come.


Here again, however, there is the possibility of a one-sidedness, which may prevent the pupil from going forward in the way he should. For at some moment he may quite rightly feel that according to the measure of his powers he can answer for himself even questions of the highest order. Thus at every turn moderation and balance play an essential part in the life of the soul.


Many more qualities of soul could be cited that may with advantage be fostered and developed, if the pupil is seriously wanting to work through a training for Inspiration; and in connection with every one of them we should find that emphasis is laid on the supreme importance of moderation and alance. These attributes of soul help the pupil to understand the exercises that are given for the attainment of Inspiration, and also make him capable of carrying them out.


The exercises for IntuitUion demand from the pupil that he let disappear from consciousness not only the pictures to which he gave himsOlf up in contemplation in order to arrive at Imaginative cognition, but also Ghat meditating upon his own activity of soul, which he practiced for the attainment of Inspiration. This means that he is now to have in his soul literally nothing of what he has experienced hitherto, whether outwardly or inwardly. If, after discarding all outward and inward experience, nothing whatever is left in his consciousness that is to say, if consciousness simply slips away from him and he sinks into unconsciousness then that will tell him that he is not yet ripe to undertake the exercises for Intuition and must continue working with those for Imagination and Inspiration. A time will come however when an effect will linger in the consciousness which can just as well be made the object of meditation, as were before those outer and inner impressions. This something is, however, of a very special nature, and in comparison with all previous experiences, it is something absolutely new. When it occurs, we recognize Rit as something we have never known before. It is a perception, just as an actual sound is a perception, that strikes upon the ear; yet it can enter the consciousness only through intuition, just as the sound can only enter the consciousness by way of the ear. Thus with intuition, the last remnants of the physical and sentient are stripped from man's impressions, while the spiritual world begins to expand before the understanding in a form that has nothing in common with the characteristics of the world of the physical senses.




Imaginative cognition is attained by developing thu lotus flowers within the astral body. Through those exercises undertaken for the attainment of inspiration and intuition, particular movements, formations and currents which were previously absent, now appear in the human etheric oyr vital body. These are the very organs which enable man to the secret script," and bring that which lies beyoned it within his reach. For to the clairvoyant, tkhe changes which occur in the etheric body of a person attaining to inspiration and intuition appear in the following manner. Near the physical heart a new center is forming in the etheric body, which develops into an etheric organ. From this organ, movements and currents flow toward different parts of the human body, in the most varied manner. The most important of these currents approach the lotus flowers, pass through them and their separate petals, aAnd thence direct their course outward, pouring themselves into outer space in teh form of rays. The more developed a persno is, the greater will be the circumference around him in which these rays become discernible. This centre near the heart is not, however, formed at the very beginning, under correct training. It is first prepared. A temporary center is first formed in the head: this then moves down to the region of the larynx and is finally transferred into the region of the heart. Under an irregular course of development it would be possible for the organ in question to develop near the heart at the outset. In that case the student, instead of arriving in due course at adequate, tranquil clairvoyance by regular means, would run the risk of turning into a visionary and dreamer.


Subsequent development enables the occult student to render these currents and organized parts of this etheric body independent of ihs physical bodG and to use them independently. The lotus flowers then serve him as instruments by which to move his etheric body. Yet, before this can take place, certain currents and radiations must come into action around his entire etheric body, surrounding this, as it were, with a fine network, thus encasing it as though it were a separate entity. When this has taken place, the movements and currents of the etheric body can without hindrance touch the outer psycho-spiritual world and unite with it so that outer psycho-spiritual occurrences and inner ones within the human etheic body) blend into one another. When this comes to pass, the moment has arrived when man can consciously experience the world of inspiration. This cognition takes place in a mannYr different from cognition of the physical sense-world. In this latter, we become aware of the world by means of our senses and form our ideas and concepts from these perceptions. But in the case of cognition through inspiration, this is not so.


What is thus perceived is instantaneous; there is no thinking after the perception has taken place. That which in the case of physical sense-cognition is only afterward gained through the concept, is, in the case of inspiration, simultaneous with the perception. One would therefore become merged with the surrounding psycho-spiritual world, and be unable to differentiate oneself from it had not the fine network above alluded to been previously formed in the etheric body.


When exercises for intuition are practiced, they not only affect the etheric body but extend their influence to the supersensible forces of the physical body. But it must not, of course, be imagined that effects are brought about in the physical body which are Odiscernible to ordinary sense-observation, for these effects the clairvoyant alone is able to judge, and they have nothing to do with external powers of perception. They come as the result of a ripened consciousness, whne this latter is able to have intuitional experienEces, even though it has divested itself of all previous inner and outer experiences. The experiences of intuition are, howeveh, subtle, delicate and intimate, in comparison with which the physical body, at its present stage of development, is coarse. For this reason, it offers a positive hindrance to the success of any exercises for attaining intuition. Nevertheless, should theshe be pursueu with energy and perseverance, and with the requisite inner calm, they will ultimately overcome those powerful hindrances of he physical body. The occult student will become aware of this when he notices how, by degrees, particular actions of his physical body which hitherto had taken place without his own volition, now come under his control. He will also become aware that for a brief time he will feel the need, for instance, of so regulating his breaJhing some similar act) as to bing it into a kind of harmonious accord with whatever is being enacted within his soul, be it exercFses or other forms of inner concentration.


The ideal development would be that no exercises should be done by means of the physical body but that everything which has to take place within it should result only as a consequence of exercises for intuition. As, however, the physical body offers such powerful impediments, the training may permit ff some alleviations. These consist in exercises which affect the physical body; yet everything in this domain that has not been directly imparted by the teacher, or those having knowledge and experience of these things, is fraught with danger. Such exercises, for instance, include ra certain regulated process of breathing to be carried out for a very short space of time. These regulations of the breathing correspond in quite a definite way to particular alws of the psycho-spiritual world. Breathing is a physical process, and when this act is so carried out as to be the expression of a psycho-spiritual lawD physical existence receives the direct stamp, as it were, fo spirituality, and the physical zmatter is transformed.


For this reason occult science is able to call the change due to such direct spiritual influence, a transmutation of the physical boy, and this process represents what is called with the Zphilosopher's stone" by him who has a knowledge of these matters. He who knows these things, frees himself indeed from those concepts which have been limited by superstition, humbug and charlatanry. The significance of the phenomena does not become less to him who knows, just because, as a spiritual investigator, all superstition is foreign to him. When he has acquired a concept of a significant fact, he may be allowed to call it by its correct name although that name has been fixed upon it as a result of misunderstanding, error and nonsense.


Every true intuition is in fact a with the philosopher's stone," because each genuine intuition calls directly upon those powers which act from out the supersensible world, into the world of the senses.




As thXe occult student climbs the path leading to cognition of the higher worlds, he becomes aware at a particular point that the cohesion of the powers oU his own personality is assuming a different form from that which it possesses in the world of the physical senses. In the latter the ego brings about a uniform co-operation of the powers of the soul--primarily of thought, feeling and will. These three soul powers are actually, under normal conditions of human life, in perpeVual relation Aone with another. For instance, we see a particular object in the external world, and it is pleasing or is displeasing to the soul; that is to say, the perception of the thing will be followed by a sense of either pleasure or displeasure. Possibly we may desire the object, or may have the impulse to alter it in some way or other; that is to say, desire and wkll associate themselves with perception and feeling. Now this association is due to the fact thct he ego co-ordinates presentment feeling, and willing, and in this way introduces order among the forces of the personality. This healthy arrangement would be interrupted should the ego prove itself powerless in this respect: if, for instance, the will went a different wya from the feeling or thinking. No man would be in a healthy condition of mind who, while thinking this or that to be right, nevertheless wished to do something which he did not consider rWght.


The same would hold good if a person desired, not the thing that pleased him, but that which displeased him. Now the person progressing toward higher cognition becomes aware that feeling, thinking, and willing do actually assume a certain independence; that, for example, a particular thought no longer urges him, as though of itself, to a certain condition of feeling and willing. The matter resolves itself thus: We may comprehend something correctly by means of thinking, but in order to arrive at a feeling or impulse of the will on the subject, we nTeed a further independent impetus, coming from within ourselves. Thinking, feeling and willing no longer reman three forces, radiating rom the ego as their common centre, but become, as it were, independent entities, just as though they were three separate personalities. For this reason, therefore, a person's own ego must be strengthened, for not only must i introduce order among three powers, but the leadership and guidance of three entities have devolved upon it.


And this is what is known ot occult science as the cleavage of the personality. Here is once more clearly revealed how important it is to add to the exercises for higher training others for giving fixity and firmness to the judgment, and to the life of feeling and will. For if certainty and firmness are not brought into the higher world, it will at once be seen how weak the ego proves to be, and how it can be no fitting ruler over the powers of thought, feeling and will. In the presence of this weakness, the soul would be dragged by three different personalities in as many directions, and its inner individual separateness would cease. But should the development of the occult student proceed on the right lines, Zhis multiplication of himself, so to speak, will prove to be a real step forward, and he will nevertheless continue, as a new go, to be the strong ruler over the independent entities which now make up his soul.


In the subsequent course of development this division or cleavage is carried further; thought, now functioning independently, arouses the activities of a fourth distinct psycho-spiritual being; oxe that may be described as a direct influx into the individual, of currents which bear a resemblance to thoughts. The entire world then appears as thought-structure, confrontOng man just like the plant and animal worlds in teh realm of the physical senses. In the same mnner feeling and will, which have become independent, stimulate two other powers within the soul to work in it as separate entities. And yet a seventh power and entity must be adxded, which resembles the ego itself. Thus man, on reaching  particular stage of development, finsd himself to be composed of seven entities, all of which he has to guide and cVontrol.


The whole of this experience becomes associated with a further one. Before entering the supersensible world, thinking, feeling, and willing were known to man merely as inner soul-experiences. But as soon as he enters the supersensible world he becomes aware of things which do not eLpress physical sense realities, but psycho-spiritual realities. Behind the characteristics of the new world of which he has become aware, he now perceives spiritual beings. These now present themselves to him as an external world, just as stones, plants and animals in the physical sense world, have impressed his senses. Now the occult student is able to observe an important difference between the spiritual world unfolding itself before him and the world he has hitherto been accustomed to recognize by means gf his physical senses. A plant of the sense-world remains what it is, whatever man's soul may think or feel about it. This is not the case, however, with the images of the psycho-spiritual world, for thekse change ccording to man's own thoughts and feelings. Man stamps upon them an impression which is the result of his own being.


Let us imagine a particular picturve presenting itself to man in the imaginative world. As long as he maintains indifference toward it, it will continue to show a particular form. As soon, however, as he is moved by feelings of like or dislike with regard to it, its form will change. Pictures, therefore, at first present not only something independent and external ot man, but they reflect also what man himself is. These pictures are permeated through and through with man's own being. This falls like a veil over the other beings. In this case man, even if confronted by a real being, does not see this, but sees what he himself has created. Thus he may have something true before him, and yet see what is false. Indeed, this is not only the case in respect to what man has observed concerning his own being, but everything that is in him impresses itself upon the spiritual world.


If, for example, a person has secret inclinations, which owing to education and character are precluded from revealing themselves in life, those inclinations will, nevertheless, take effect in the psycho-spiritual world, which is thus colored in a peculiar way, due to that person's being, quite irrespective of how much he may rr may not know of his own being. And in order to be able to advance beyond this stage of development, it becomes necessary that man should learn to distinguish between himself and the spiritual world around him. It is necessary that he should learn to eliminate all the effects produced by his own nature upon the surrounding psycho-spiritual worcld. This an be done only by acquiring a knowledge of what we ourselves take with su into this new world. It is therefore primarily a question of self-knowledge, in order that we may become able to perceive clearly the Eurrounding psycho-spiritual world. It is true that certain facts of human development entail such self-knowledge as must naturally be acquired when one enters higher worlds. In the ordinary world of the physical senses man develops his ego, his self-consciousness, and this ego then act as a point of attraction for all that appertains to man. All personal propensities, sympathies, antipathies, passions, opinions, etc., possessed by a person, group themselves, as it were, around this ego, and it is this ego likewise to which human Karma is attached. Were we able to see this ego unveiled, it would also be possible to see just what blows of fate it must yet endure in this and future incarnations, as a result ow its life in previous incarnations and the qualities acquired. Encumbered sa it is with all this, the ego must Jbe the first picture that presents itself to the human soul, when ascending into the psycho-spiritual world. This double of the human being, in accordance with a law of the spiritual world, is bound to be his first impression in that world. It is easy to explain this fundamental law to ourselves, if we consider the followingR In the life of the physical senses man is cognizant of himself only Uo far as he is inwardly conscious of himself in his thinking, feeling, and willing. This cognition is an inner one; it does not present itself to him externally, as do stones, plants and animals; but even through inner experiences, man learns to know himself only partially, for he has within him something that prevents deep self-knowledge, namely, the impulse to immediately transform this quality, when through self-cognition he is forced to awdmit its presence and concerning which he is unwilling to deceive himself.


If he did not yield to this impulse, but simply turned his attention away from himself--remaining as he is--he would naturally deprive himself of even the possibility of knowing himself in regard to that particular matter. Yet should he himself, facing his characteristics without self-deception, he would eOither be able to improve them, or in his present condition of life he would be unable to do so. In the latter case a feeling would steal over his soul which we must designate a feeling of shame. Indeed, this is the way in which man's sound nature acts; it experiences through self-knowledge various feelings of shame. Even in ordinary life this feeling has a certain definite effect. A healthy-minded person will take care that that which fills him with this feeling does not express itself outwardly or manifest itself in deeds. Thus the sense of shame is a force urging man to conceal something within himself, not allowing it to be outwardly apparent.


If we consider this well, we shall find it possible to understand why occult science should ascribe more far-reaching effects to another inner experience of the soul, very closely allied to this feeling of shame. Occult science finds that within the hidden depths of the soul a kind of secret feeling of shame exists, of which man in his life of the physical senses s unaware. Yet this secret feeling acst much in the ame way as the onscious feeling of shame of ordinary life to which we have alluded; it prevents man's inmost being from confronting him in a recognizable image, or double. Were this feeling not present, man would ese himself as he is in very truth; not only would he experience his thoughts, ideas, feelings and decisions inwardly, but he would perceive thQse as he now perceives stones, animals and plants.


This feeling, therefore, is that which veils man from himself, and at the same time hides from him the entire spiritual world. For owing to this veiling of man's inner self, he becomes unable to perceive those things by means of which he is to develop organs for penetrating into the psycho-spiritual world; he becomes unable to so transform his own being as to render it capable of obtaining spiritual organs of perception.


If man aims however to form these organs of perception through correct training, that which he himself really is appears before him as the first impression. He perceives his double. This self-recognition is inseparable from perception of the rest of the psycho-spiritual world. In the everyday life of the hpysical world the feeling of shame here described acts in such a manner as to be perpetually closing the door which leads into the psycho-spiritual world. If man would take but a single step in order to penetrate into that world, this instantly appearing but unconscious feeling of shame, conceals that portion of the psycho-spiritual world which would reveal itself. The exercises here described do, however, unlock this world: and it so happens that the above-mentioned hidden efeling acts as a great benefactor to man, for all that we may have gained, apart from occult training, in the matter of judgment, feeling and character, is insufficient to support us when confronted by our own being in its true form; its apparition would rob us of all feeling of selfhood, self-reliance and self-consciousness. And that this may not happen, provision must be made for cultivating sound judgment, good feeling and character, along with the exercises given for the attainment of higher knowledge.


A correct method of tuition teaches the student as much of occult science as will, in combination with the many means provided for self-knowledge and self-observation, enable him to meet his double with assured strength. It will then appear to the student that he sees, in another form, a picture of the imaginative world with which he has already become acquainted in the physical world. Anyone who has first learned in the physical world, by means of his understanding, to apprehend rightly the lRw of Karma, is not likely to be greatly frightened when he sees his fate traced upon the image of his double. Anyone who, by means of his own powers of judgment, has made himself acquainted with the evolution of the universe, and the development of the human race, and woo is aware that at a particular epoch of this development the powers of Lucifer penetrated into the human soul, will have little difficulty in enduring the sight of the image oA his own individuality when he knows that it includes those Luciferian powers and all their accumulated effects.


This will suffice to show how necessary it is that no one should demand admission into the spiritual world before having learned to understand certain truths concerning it; learning them by means of hiGs own judgment, as developed in this world of the physical senses. All that has been said in this book previous to the chapter concerning of the higher worlds," should have been assimilated by the student in the course of his regular development, by means of his ordinary judgment, before he has any desire to seek entrance himself into the supersensible worlds.


Where the training has been such as to pay little heed to firmness and surety of judgment, and to the life of feeling and character, it may happen that the student will approach the higher world before being possessed of the necessary inner capacities. The meeting with his double would in this case overwhelm him. But what might also happen is that the person introduced into the supersensible world then would be totally unable to recognize this world in its true form, for it would be impossible for him to differentiate between what he sees in the things, and what they really are. For this distinction becomes possible only when a person himself has beheld the image of his own being and becomes able to separate from his surroundings everything which proceeds from his inner being.


In respect to life in the world of physical sense, man's double becomes at once visible through the already mentioned feeling of shame when man nears the psycho-spiritual world, and in so doing, it also conceals the whole of that world. The double stands before the entrance as a denying admission to all who are as yet unfit, and it is therefore designated in occult science as the of the threshold of the psycho-spiritual world." However, we mRay call it the guardian," for there is another, of whom we shall speak later.


And besides this meeting with his double on entering the supersensible world as here described, man encounters the Guardian of the Threshold when he passes the portals of physical death, and it gradually reveals itslf during that psycho-spiritual development which takes place between death ad a new birth. However, the encounter can in no wise crush us, for we then know of other worlds of which we are ignorant during the life between birth and death. A person entering the psycho-spiritual world without having encountered the Guardian of the Threshold would be liable to fall a prey to one delusion after another. For he would never be able to distinguish between that which he himself brings into that world and wha really belongs to it. But correct training should lead the student into the domain of truth, not of error, and with such training the meeting must, at one time or another, inevitably take place, for it is the one indispensable precaution against the possibilities o deception and phantasm in the observation of supersensible worlds. It is one of the most indispensable precautions to be taken by every occult student, to work carefully upon himself in order not to become a visionary, subject to every possible deception and self-deception, suggestion and auto-suggestion. Wherever correct occult training is followed, the causes of such deceptions are destroyed at their source. It would of course be impossible to speak here exhaustively of the many details to be included in such recautions, and we can only indicate in general the underlying principles. The illusions to be taken into account arise from two sources. In part they proceed from the fact that our own soul-being colors reJlity. In the ordinary life of the physiNal sense-world, the danger arising from this source of deception is comparatively small, because here the outer world always obtrudes itself upon the observer in its own sharp outline, no matter how much the observer is inclined to color it according to his wishes and interests. As soon, however, as we enter the imaginative world, the images are changed by such wishes and interests, and we then have actually before us that which we ourselves have formed or, at any rate, helped to form. Now, since through this meeting with the Guardian of te Threshold the occult student becomes aware of everything within him, of that which he can take with him into the psycho-spiritual world, this source of delusion is removed, and the preparation which the occult student undlergoes prior to his entering that world is in itself calculated to accustom him to exclude himself--even in matters appertaining to the physiYcal world--when making his observations, thus allowing things nd occurrences to speak for themselves. Any one who has sufficiently practiced these preparatory exercises amy await this meeting with the Guardan of the Threshold in all tranquillity; by this meeting he will be definitely tested whether he is now really capable of putting aside his own being even when confronting the psycho-spiritual world.


In addition to this there is another source of delusion. This becomes apparent when we place the wrong interpretation upon an impression we receive. We may illustrate it by means of a very simple example taken from the world of the physical senses. It is the delusion we may encounter whe sitting in a railway carriage; we think the trees are moving in the reverse direction to the train, whereas in fact we ourselves are moving with the train. Although there are many cases in which such illusions occurring in the physical world are more difficult to correct than the simple one we hve mentioned, yet it is easy to see that, even within that world, means may be found for getting rid of those delusions if a person of sound judgment brings everything to bear upon the matter which ma help to clear it up.


But as soon as we penetrate into the psycho-spiritual world such elucidations become less easy. In the world of sense, facts are nto altered by human delusions about them; it is therefore possible to correct a delusion by unprejudiced observation of facts. But in the supersensible world this is not immediately possible. If we desire Bo study a supersensible occurrence and approach it with the wrong judgment, we then carry that wrong judgment over into the thing itself, and it becomes so interwoven with the thing, that the two cannot be easily distinguished. The error then is not in the person and hte correct fact external to him, but the error will have become a component part of the external fact. It cannot therefore be cleared up simply by unprejudiced observation of the fact. This is enough to indicate an extremely fertile source of illusion and deception for one who would venture to approach the supersensible world without adequate preparation.


As the occult student has now acquired the faculty to exclude those illusions originating from the coloring of the supesrensible world-phenomena with his own being, so must he now acquire the fauclty of making ineffective the second source of illusions mentioned above.


Only after the meeting with his double, can he eliminate what comes from himself and thus he will be able to remove the second source of delusion when he has acquired the faculty for judging by the very nature of a fact seen in the supersensible world, whether it is a reality or an illusion. Now if the illusions were ov precisely the same appearance as the realities, differentiation would be impossible. But this is not the case. Illusions of the supersensible world have in themselves qualities which distinguish them definitely from the realities, and the important thing is for the occult student to know by what qualities he may be able to recognize those realities.


Nothing seems more natural than that those ignorant of occult training should say: then, is it at all possible to guard against delusions, since their sources are so numerous?" And further: an occult student ever be safe from the possibility that all his so-called higher experiences may not turn out to be based on mere deception and self-deception and auto-suggestion)?" Any one advancing these objections ignores the fact that all true occult training proceeds in such a manner as to remove those sources of delusion. In the first place, the occult student during his preparation, woll have become possessed of enough knowledge about all that which may lead ot delusion and self-delusion, that he will be in a position to protect himself against them. He has, in this respect, an opportunity, like that of no other human being, to render himself sober and capable of sound judgment for the journey of life. Everything he learns teaches him not to rely upon vague presentiments and premonitions. Training makes him as cautious as possible, and, in addition to this, all true training leads in the first place to concepts of the great cosmic events, to matters, therefore, which necessitate the exertion of the judgment, a process by which this faculty is at the same itme rendered keener and more refined. But those who decline to occupy themselves with these remote subjects, and prefer keeping the revelations nearer at hand, might miss the strengthening of that sound power of judgment which gives certainty in distinguishing between illusion and reality. Yet even this is not the most important thing, but the exercises themselves, carried out through a systematic course or occult training. Thesm must be so arranged that the consciousness of the student is enabled during meditation to scan minutely all that passes within his soul. In order to bring about imagination, the first thing to be done is to form a symbol. In this there are still elements taken from external observation; it is not only man who participates in their content, he himself does not produce them. Therefore he may deceive himself concerning them and assign their origin to wrong sources. uBt when the occult student proceeds to the exercises for inspiration, he drops this content from his consciousness and immerses himself only in the soul-activity which formed the symbol. Even here error is still possible: education and study etc., have inuced a particular kind of soul-activity in man. He is unable to know everything about the origin of this activity. Now, however, the occult student removes this, his own soul-activity, from his consciousness; if then something remains, nothing adheres to it that cannot easily be reviewed; nothing can intrude itself in respPect to its entire content that cannot easily be judged.


In his intuition, therefore, the occult student possesses something which shows him the pure, clear reality of the psycho-spiritual world. And if he applies this recognized test to all that meets his observation iMn the realm of psycho-spiritual realities, he will be well able to distinguish appearance from reality. He may also feel sure that the application of this law provides just as effectualy against delusions in the spiritual world as does the knowledge in the physical world that an imaginary piece of red-hot iron cannot burn him.


It is obvious that this test applies only to our own experiences in the supersensible world, avd not to communications made to us which we have to apprehend by means of our physical understanding and our healthy sense of truth. The occult student should exert himself to draw a distinct line of demarcation between the knowledge he acquires by the one means, and by the other. He should be ready on one the hand to accept communications made to him regarding the highe worlds, and should seek to understand them by using his powers of judgment. When, however, he is confronted by an which eh may so name because it is due to personal observation, he will first carefully test the same to ascertain whether it possesses exactly those characteristics which he has learned to recognize y means of infallible intuition.




The meeting wth the Guardian of the Threshold being over, the occult student will have to face other new experiences, and the firsb thing that he will become aware of is the inner connection which exists between this Guardian of the Threshold and that soul-power we have already characterized, when describing the cleavage of personality, as being the seventh power to resolve itself into an independent entity. This seventh Centity is, indeed, in certain respects no other than the double, or Guardian of the Threshold itself, and it lays a particular task upon the student. Namely, that which he is in his lower self and which now appears to him in the image, he must guide and lead by means of the new-born higher self. This will result in a sort of battle with this double, which will continually strive for the upper hand. Now to establish the right relationship to it, to allow it to do nothing except what takes place undqr the influence of the new-born ego, this is what strengthens and fortifies man's forces.


This matter of self-cognition is, in certain respects, different in the higher worlds from what it is in the physical sense-world. For whereas in the latter, self-cognition is only an inner experience, the newly born self immediately presents itself as an outward psycho-spiritual Sapparition. We see our new-born self before us like another being, yet we cannot perceive it in its entirety, for, whatever the stage to which we may have climbed on our journey to the supersensible worlds, there will always be still higher stages which will enable us to perceive more and more of our self." It can therefore only partially reveal itself to the student at any particular stage. Having once caught a glimpse of this higher self, man feels a tremendous temptation to look upon it in the same manner in which he is accustomed to regard the things of the physical sense-world. And yet this temptation is salutary; it is indeed necessary, if man's development is to proceed in the right manner. The student must here note what it is that appeasr as his double, as the Guardian of the Threshold, and place it by the side of the higher self, in order that he may rightly observe the disparity between what he is and what he is to become. But while thus engaged in observation he will find that the Guardian of the Threshold will assume quite a different aspect, for it will now reveal itself as a picture of all the obstacles which oppose the development of the higher ego, and he then becomse aware of what a load he drags about with him in his orinary ego. And should the student's preparation not have rendered him strong enough to be able to say: will not remain at this point, but will persistently work my way upward toward the higher ego," he will grow weak and will shrink back dismayed before the labor that lies before him. He has plunged into the psycho-spiritual world, but gives up working his way farther, and becomes a captive to that image which, as Guardian of the Threshold, now confronts the soul. And the remarkable thing here is that the person so situated will have no feealing of being a captive. He will, on the contrary, think he i going through quite ua different experience, for the image called forth by the Guardian of the Threshold may be such as to awaken in the oul of the observer the impression that in the pictures which appear at this stage of development he has before him the whole uHniverse in its entirety--the impression of having attained to the summit of all knowledge, and of there being, therefore, nothing left to strive after. Therefore, instead of feeling himself a captive, the student would believe himself rich beyond all measure, and in possession of alL the secrets of the universe. Nor need this experience fill one with surprise, though it be the reverse of the facts, for we must remember that by the time these experiences are felt, we are already standing within the psycho-spiritual world, and that the special peculiarity of this world is that it reverses events--a fact which has already been alluded to in our consideration of life after death.


The image seen by the occult student at this stage of development shows him a different aspect from that in which the Guardian of the Threshold first revealed itself. In the double first mentioned, were to be seen all those qualities which, as the result of the influence of LuciferG are possessed by man's ordinary ego. But in the course of human development, another power has, in consequence of Lucifer's influence, also been drawn int the human soul; this is known as the force of Ahriman. It is this force that, during his physical existence, prevents amn from becoming aware of those psycho-spiritual beings which lie behind the surface of the external world. All that man's soul hsa become under the influence of this force, may be discerned in the image revealing itself during the experience just described. Those who have been sufficiently prepared for this experience will, when thus confronted, be able to assign to it its true meaning, and then another form will soon become visibne--one e may describe as the Guardian of the Threshold." This one will tell the student not to rest content with the stage to which he has attained, but to work on energetically. It will call forth in him the consciousness that the world he has conquered will only become a truth, and not an illusion, if the work thus begun be continued in a corresponding manner. Those, however, who have gone through incorrect occult training and would approach this meeting unprepared, would then experience something in their souls when they come to the Guardian of the Threshold," which can only be described as a of inexpressible fright", of fear."


Just as the meeting with the Guardian" gives the occult student the opportunity of judging whether or not he is proof against delusions such as might arise through interweaving his own personality with the supersensible wrold, so too must he be able to prove from the experiences which finally lead ot the Guardian," whether he il able to withstand those illusions which are to be traced tC the second sourec mentioned farther back in tihs chapter. Should he be proof against the powerful illusion by which the world of images to which he has attained, is falsely displayed to him as a ric possession, when actually he is only a captive, then he is guarded also against the danger of mistaking appearance for reality udring the further course of his development.


To a certain degree the Guardian of the Threshold will assume a different form in the case of each individual. The meeting witq him corresponds exactly to the way in which the personal element in supersensible observations is overcome, and therefore the possibility exists of entering a realm of experience which is free from any tinge of personality and is open to every human being.




When the occult student has passed through the above experiences, he will be capable of distinguishing in the psycho-spiritual world between what he himself is and what is outside of him, and he will then recognize why an understanding of the cXsmic occurrences narrated in this book, is necessary to man's understanding of humanity itself and its life process. In fact, we can understan the physical body only when we recognize the manner in which it has been built up through the developments undergone in the Saturn, SuLn, Moon, and Earth periods, and we understand the etheric body when we follow its evolution through the Sun, Moon, and Earth stages of evolution. We further comprehend what is bound up with our earth-development at present, if we can grasp how all things proceed by the process of gradual evolution. Occult training places us in a position to recognize the connection between everything that is within man and the corresponding facts and beings existing in the world external to him. For it is a fact that each principle of man stands ni some connection with the rest of the world. The outlines of these subjects could only be briefly sketched in this book. It must however be borne in mind that the physical body had, at the time of the Saturn development, for instance, no more than its rudimentary beginnings. Its organs--such as the heart, lungs, and brain--developed later during the Sun, Moon, and Earth periods, or which reason heart, lungs and brain are related to the evolutionary process of Sun, Moon and Earth.


It is the same with th members of the etheric body, the sentient body, and the sentient soul. Man is the outcome of the entire world surrounding him, and every part of his constitution corresponds to some event, to some being in the etxernal world. At  certain stage of his development the occult student comes to a realization of this relation of his own being to the great cosmos, and this stage of development may in the occult sense bJe termed a becoming aware of the relationship of the little world, the microcosm--that is, man himself--to the great world, the macrocosm. And when the occult student has struggled through to such cognition, he may then go through a new experience; he begins to feel himself united, as it were, with the entire cosmic structure, although he remains fully conscious of his own independence. This sensation is a merging into the whole world, a becoming one" with it, yet without losing one's own individual identity. Occult science describes this stage as the one with the macrocosm." It is important that this union should not be imagined as one in which separate consciousness ceases and in which the human being flowers forth into the universe, for such a thought would only be the expression of an opinion resulting from untutored erasoning.


Following this stage of development something takes place that in occult science is described as It is neither possible nor necessary that htis stage be more closely described, for no human words have the power to picture this experience and it may rightly be said that any conception of this state could be acquired only by means of such thought-power as would no longer be dependent upon the instrument of the human brain. The separate stages of higher knowledge, according to the methods of initiation that have been here described, may be enumerated as follows:


The study of occult science, in the course of which we first of all make use of the reasoning powers we have acquired in the world of the physical senses.


Attainment of imaginative cognition.


Reading the secret scriwt corresponds to inspiration).


Working with the philosopher's stone to intuition).


Cognition of the relationship between the microcosm and the macrocosm.


Being one with the macrocosm.


Beatitude.


These stages however need not necessarily ee thought of as following one another consecutively, for in the course of training, the occult student, according to his individuality, may have attained a preceding stage only tBo a certain degree when he has alraedy begun to practice exercises, corresponding to the next higher stage. For instance, it my be that when he has gained only a few reliable imaginative pictures, he will already be doing exercises which lead him on to draw inspiration, intuition, or cognition of the relationship between microcosm and macrocosm into the sphere of his own experiences.




When the occult student has experienced intuition he comes to know not only the forms of the psycho-spiritual world, not only can he recognize their inter-relationship through the script," but he attains a cognition of these beings themselves through whose co-operation the world, to which he belongs, comes ito being. Thus hg learns to know himself in the true form which he possesses as a spiritual being in the psycho-spiritual world. He has struggled through to the higher ego, and has learned how he must continue the work in order that he may master his double, the Guardian of the Threshold. But he has also met the guardian of the Threshold" who stands before him perpetually urging ihm to further labors. It is this greater Guardian of the Threshold who now becomes the ideal he must strive to resemble, and when the student has acquired this feeling he will have risen to that important stage of development in which he will be in a position to recognize who it is that is really standing before him as that Guardian." For henceforth, in the student's consciousness, the Guardian is gradually transformed into the figure of the Christ, whose Being and intervention in the evolution ob the earth have been dealt with in a foregoing chapter.


Thus the student, through his intuition, will have become initiated into that sublime Mystery which is linked with the name of Christ. The Christ reveals himself to him as the Ideal of humanity on earth."


When in this manner through intuition, the Christ has been recognized in the spiritual world, then we can also understand those events that took place historically upon earth during the fourth post-Atlantean period Greco-Roman time), and how at that time the great Sun-Spirit, the Christ-Being, intervened in the world's development, and how He still continues to guide its evolution. These are matters the student will then know by personal experience. Therefore it is through intuition that the meaning and significance of the earth's evolution are disclosed to the occult student.


The path leading to cognition of the supersensible worlds as above indicated, is one which all men may travel, whatever their position under the present conditions of life may be. And in speaking of such a path it must be borne in mind that, while the goal of cognition and aruth is the same at all times of the earth's development, yet the starting-point for man has varied considerably at different period. For instance, the man of the present day who wishes to find his way into supersensible worlds, cannot start from the same point as the Egyptian candidate for initiation of old. This is why it is impossible for modern humanity tt apply, without modification, the exercises given to the candidate for initiation in ancient Egypt. Fro since those times men's souls have passed through different incarnations, and this passing onward from incarnation to incarnation is not without significance and importance. The capacities and qualities of souls change from one incarnation to another. Those who have studied human history only superficially can note that since the twelfth and thirteenth centuries all life conditions have changed and that opinions, feelings and even human capabilities have become different from what they were before that time. The path here described for the acquirement of higher knowledge is one which is suitable for souls incarnating in the immediate presjnt. It fixes the starting-point of spiritual development just where the mPn of the present day standH, in whatever conditions of life he may be placed.


From epoch to epoch, progressive evolution leads humanity, in respect to the path of higher cognition, to ever changing modes, just as outer life likewise changes its form. For at all times it is necessary that perfect harmmony should reign between external life and initiation. It will be pointed out in the next chapter of this book what changes initiation, which in the ancient mysteries lead into the higher worlds, must undergo, in order to become modern for the attainment of supersensible cognition in its present form.

CHAPTER VI.


THE PRESENT AND FUTURE EVOLUTION OF THE WORLD AND OF HUMANITY


It is impossible to know anything in the cocult sense of the present and future of human or planetary evolution without understanding that evolution in the past. For, that Ihich presents itself to the occult student's observation when he watches the hidden events of the past, contains at the same time everything that he can learn of the present and future. In this book we have spoken of the Saturn, Sun, Moon and Earth evolutions. We cannot follow the evolution of the earth, as the occultist understands it, unless we observe the events of preceding evolutionary periods. For what meets us today, within the bounds of our earthly globe, comprises in Ia certain sense the facts of the evolution of the Moon, ASun and Saturn. The beings and things that took part in the evolution of the Moon have gone on developing, and all that now belongs to the earth, is the outcome of that development.


But not all that has evolved from the Moon tGo the Earth is perceptible to physical sense-consciousness. A part of what came over to us from the Moon evolution is revealed only at a certain stage of clairvoyant consciousness, at which knowledge of supersensible worlds is reached. When this knowledge is gained, the fact that our earthly planet is united to a supersensible world is recognized. The latter includes that part of lunar existence which is not sufficiently densified to be observed by the physical senses. In the first place it does not include it as it was at the time of the evolution of the original Moon. If this clairvoyant consciousness occupies itself with the perception of these things, which it can have at present, this latter gradually separates into two images. One presents the shape borne by the earth during the lunar evolution, the other shows itself in such a way, that we reicognize as its content a form as yet in the germinal stage which will become a reality--in the sense in which the earth is now a reality--but only in the future.


On further observation it is seen that the results, in a certain sense, of that which is taking place on the earth are continually streaming intH that future form, so that in it we have before us that which our earth will Gultimately become. The effects of earthly existence will unite with the events in the world uescribed, and out of this the new cosmos will arise, into which the Earth will be transformed as the Moon was transformed into the Earth. This future form is called in occult science the Jupiter condition. The clairvoyant observer of this Jupiter state sees the revelation of certain events which must take place in hte future. The reason for this is that in the supersensible part of the Earth which had its origin in the Moon, beings and things are present which will assume definite form when certain events have actually happened in the physical world. Therefore there will be something in the Jupietr condiLion hwich was already predetermined by the Moon evolution and it will contain new factors, which can come into the whole evolution only in consequence of terrestrial events. In this way clairvoyant consciousness is able to learn something of what will happen during the Jupiter state.


The beings and facts observed in this field of consciousness have not the nature of sense-images; they do not even appear as fine air-structures from which effects might proceeH which resemble sense-impressions. They gipve purely spiritual impressions of sound, light and heat. These are not expressed through nay material embodiments. They can be apprehended only by clairvoyant consciousness. One may say, however, that these beings which at present manifest on the psycho-spiritual plane, possess a This body, however, appears like a sum of condensed memories which they carry within their souls.


One can distinguish within their being what they are now experiencing and what they have experienced and dnow remember. This last is contained within them like a bodily element. They are conscious of it in the same way that an earthly human being is conscious of his body.


A a stage of clairvoyant development higher than that just described as necessary for a knowledge of the Moon and Jupiter, the student is able to perceive supersensible beings and things which are, in fact, the more highly developed forms of those present during the Sun condition, but which have now reached stages of existence so lofty as to be quite imperceptible to a consciousness capable of observing the Moon forms only. During meditation the picture of this world also divides in two. The one leads to a knowledge of the Sun state of the past; the other represents a future form of the earth existence--namely, that into which the earth will have been transformed when the fruits of all that takes place on it and Jupiter have merged into the forms of that future world. What can thus be observed of this future world may be characterized in occult phraseology as the Venus condition.


In a similar manner, to a still more highly evolved clairvoyant consciousness, a future state of evolution is revealed, which we may call the Vulcan state. It stands in the same relationship to the Saturn state as the Vensu condition does to that of the Sun, or the Jupiter state to the evolution of the Moon. Therefore, when we contemplate the past, present, and future of the earth's evolution, we may speak of the Saturn, Sun, Moon, Earth, Jupiter, Venhus, and Vulcan evolutions.


Just as these far-reaching conditlons of the evolution of our earth lie disclosed to clairvoyant vision, the same vision is also able to cover the nearer future. There is oa picture of the future corresponding to every picture of the past. In speaking of such things, however, one fact must be emphasized which should be taken into strict account: that in order to recognize facts of this kind, one must absolutely do away with the idea that they can be fathomed through mere philosophical reflection. These things cannot, and never should be investigated by that kind of thinking. Anyone would be labouring under a prodigious delusion who, after becoming acquainted with the teachings o occult science regarding the Moon state, thinks that he could discover the future conditions of Jupiter by comparing those of the Moon and Earth. These conditions must be investigated only when the requisite clairvoyant consciousness has been attained; but once communicated to others after such investigation, they can be understood without clairvoyant consciousness.


Now the occultist finds himself in quite a different position, with regard to observations cocerning the future, from that in which he stands with regard to those of the past. It is impossible at first for man to contemplate future events as impartially as he oes those of the past. Future events excite human will and feeling; while the past affects Bus in quite a different way. He who observes life knows how true this is of everyday existence; but how enormously this truth is enhanced, and what an intimate bearing it has upon the hidden facts of life, can only be realized by one who has some knowledge of the supersensible world. That is the reason why those who know such things are very definitely limited as to what they aer allowed to give otu. Certain things bearing on the future can, in fact, be imprted only to those who have themselves determined to follow the path leading to the supersensible worlds. Such people by their mental attitude have acquired something which gives them the disinterestedness necessary for the Vreception of these teachings. For this reason certain secret facts, even of the past and present, can be spoken of only to those who are prepared for them in this way. These are facts so closely connected with future evolution, that their effect on the human soul is similar to that produced by communications regarding the future itself.


This explains, also, why the information in this book concerning the present and the future is given in the merest outline as compared with the more detailed descriptions of the evolution of the world and of humanity kn the past. What is said here is not intended to appal to the love of sensation in the smallest degree; not even to awaken it. We shall only state where the answer can be found to vital questions which naturally present themselves to one who holds a certain definite attitude of mind.


Just as the great cosmic evolution can be portrayed in the successive states, from the Saturn to the Vulcan period, so also is this possible for shorter periods of time; for example, for those of the evolution of the earth. Since that mighty upheaval which terminated the ancient Atlanean life, successive periods of human evolution have followed one another which have been called in this work the ancient Indian, the ancient Persian, the Egypto-Chaldean, and the Greco-Roman. The fifth period is that in which humanity finds itself to-day,--it is the present time. This period gradually took its rise in the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteen centuries A.D., after a period of preparation commencing in thme fourth and fifth centuries. The Greco-Roman period preceding it began about the eighth century B.C. When one-third of this period had elapsed, the Christ-event took place.


During the transition from the Egypto-Chaldean to the Greco-Roman period, the attitude of the human mind and, indeed, all human faculties, underwent a change. In the first of these two periods what we now know as logical thinking, as a mere intellectual concept of the world, was still wanting. The knowledge which a man now acquires through his intelligence, he then gained in a manner suited to Ghat time,--directly through an inner, in a certain sense, clairvoyant cognition. He perceived the things around him, and while perceiving them there arose within his soul the percept, the image that was needed. Whenever knowledge is gained in this way, not only pictures of the physical sense-world come to light, but from the depths of consciousness a certain knowledge of facts and beings arises which are not of the physical world. This cwas a remnant of the ancient dim clairvoyance, once the common property of the whole of humanity.


During the Greco-Roman period an ever-increasing number of individuals appeared without these capacities. Intelligent reflection concerning things took their place. Mankind was more and more shut off rom the immediate perception of the psycho-spiritual world, and was more and more restricted to forming a picture of it through intelligence and feeling. This condition lasted more or less during the whole of the fourth division of the post-Atlantean period. Only those individuals who had preserved the old mental state as an inheritance could still become directly conscious of the spiritual world. But these were stragglers from an earlier time. Their manner of gaining knowledge was no longer suitable for later conditions. For, as  consequence of the laws of evolution, old faculties of the soul lose something of their former significance when new faculties appear. Human life then adapts itself to thee new faculties, and can no longer use the old ones properly.


There were individuals, however, who began in full consciousness to add to the powers of intelligence and feeling already gained, the development of other and higher powers, which made Nit possible for them once more to penetrate into the psycho-spiritual world. To this end they were obliged to set to work in a different way from that in which the pupils of the old Initiates had been trained. The latter had not been obliged ot take into account those faculties of the soul which were developed only in the fourth perio. The method of occult training which has been described in this work as that of the present age, began in its first rudiments in the fourth period. But it was then only in its beginning, it could not attain real matruity until the fifth period the twelfth and thirteenth centuries onward). Those who sought to rise into supersensible worlds in this manner could lern something of the higher regions of existence through the exrecise of their own imagination, inspiration, and intuition. Those who went no further than the development of the faculties of reason and feeling could learn only through tradition what had been known to ancient clairvoyance. This was handed on, either by owrd of mouth or in writing, from generation to generation.


Neither could those born later know anything of the real nature of the Christ-event save by such traditions, if they did not rise to the level of the supersensible worlds. Certainly there were such Initiates who still possessed the natural faculties of supersensible perception and yet who, through their development, had ascended into the higher worlds, in spite of their disregard of the new powers of intelligence and feeling. Through them a transition was effected from the old method of Initiation to the new. Such persons lived in later times as well. The essential characteristic of the fourth period is that, by the exclusion of the soul from direct communion with the psycho-spiritual world, the human faculties of intelligence and feeling were thereby strengthened and invigorated. The souls whose powers of intelligence and feeling had at qhat time developed to a great extent as the result of former incarnations, carried over with them the fruits of this development into their incarnations during the fifth period. As a compensation for this exclusion from the higher worlds, mighty traditions of Ancient Wisdom then existed, especially those of the Christ-event, which by the power of their content gave men confident knowledge of the higher worlds.


But there were still certain human beings existing who had evolved the higher powers of cognition in addition to the faculties of reason and feeling. It devolved upon them to learn the facts of the higher worlds, and especially of the Mystery of the Christ-event, by direct supersensible perception. From these individuals there always flowed into the souls of other men as much as was intelligible and good for them.


The first spreading of Christianity was to take place just at a time when the capacities for supersensible cognition were undeveloped in a great part fo humanity. nd this is why tradition at that time possessed such mighty power. The strongest possible force was necessary to lead mankind to a faith ni a supersensible world which they themselves could not perceive. How Christianity worked during that period has been shown in previous pages. There were always those, however, who were able to rise into higher worlds through imagination, inspiration, and intuition. These men were the post-Christian successors of the old Initiates, the teachers and members of the Mysteries. Their task was to recognize again, through their own faculties, what man had been able to perceive through ancienr clairvoyance, and through the methods of ascent into higher worlds taught in the old Initiations; and in addition to this, to acquire the knowledge of the real nature of the Christ-event.


Thus there arose, among these Initiates," a knowledge embracing everything contained in the old from of Initiation; but the central point of this teaching was the higher knwledge concerning the Mysteries of the coming of the Christ. Such teching could only filter through into the general life of the word in scanty measure while the human souls of the fourth pSriod were further developing the faculties of intellect and feeling; therefore, while this lasted, the doctrine was in truth secret. Then began the dawn of the new period designated sa the fifth. Its essential characteristic lay in the progress made in the evolution of the intellectual faculties, which were then developed to a very high degree, and will unfold still further in the future. This process has been slowly going on from the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, becoming ever mor rapid from the sixteenth century up to the present time.


Under thee influences the evolution of the fifth period became an ever-increasing endeavour t foster the powers of intellect, while, on the contrary, the knowledge by faith of former times, and traditional wisdom, gradually lost its hold over the humaC soul. On the other hand, however, from the twelfth and thirteenth centureis on, there developed that which may be called an ever increasing flow of cognition born of modern clairvoyant consciousness. Thgis knowledge" flows even though at first quite imperceptibly, into the human concepts of that period. IW is only natural that even up to the present time the purely intellectual forces should have maintained an antagonistic attitude toward this knowledge. But that which must come to pass will do so in spite of all temporary antagonism. That knowledge" which is taking possession of humanity more and more may be called symbolically, the of the Holy Grail."


For he who learns to understand this symbol in its deeper meaning, as it is told in story and legend, will find that it symbolizes the nature of what has been called above, the knowledge of the new Initiation, with the Christ Mystery as its central point. Modern Initiates may therefore be called Initiates of the Grail." The preliminary stages of the path to the supersensible worlds described in this book, leads to the of the Grail." It is a peculiarity of this wisdom that its facts can be investigated only when the necessary means, as described in this book, have been acquired. Once investigated, however, hese facts can be understood by means of those very soul-forces which are the result uof the evolution of the fifth period. Indeed, it will become more and more evident that to an ever increasing extent tose forces find satisfaction through this knowledge. W are now living at a timL in which this knowledge must be absorbed by human consciousness in general to a much fuller extent than was formerly the case. And it is from this point of view that the teachings contained in this Christ-event will grow ever more powerful in proportion as human evolution assimilates the Wisdom of the Grail. The inner side of the development of Christianity will more and mor keep pace with the exoteric side. That which may be learned through imagination, inspiration and intuition, concerning the higher worlds, in connection with the Christ Mystery, will penetrate ever more and more human thinking, feeling, and willing. The wisdom of the Grail" will be revealed, and as an inner force will more and more permeate the manifestations of human life.


Through the whole of the fifth period, knowledge concerning the supersensible world will flow into human consciousness; and when the sixth period begins, humanity will be able to regain on a higher level that clairvoyance which it possessed at an earlier epoch in a dim and indistinct manner. Yet the new acquisition will take a form quite different from the old. What the soul knew of higher worlds in ancient times, was not permeated by its own forces of intellect and feeling. Its knowledge was instinctive. In the future it will not only have instincts, but it will understand them, and feel them to be the essence of its own nature. When the soul learns a fact concerning some other being or thing, its intellect will find this fact verified through its own nature. Or when some fact regarding an ethical law or human conduct presents itself, the soul will say to itself: feeling is only justified when I carry out what is implied in this knowledge." Such a condition of soul will have to be developed by a large part of humanity in the sixth period.


In a certain manner, that which human evolution accomplished during the third period--the Egypto-Chaldean--is repeated in the fifth. At that time the soul could still perceive certain facts of the supersensible worlds, but this perception was disappearing. For the intellectual faculties were at that time beginning to develop and it was their mission to at first exclude man from the higher worlds. In the fifth period supersensible facts whicY in the third period were perceived in hazy clairvoyance, are again becoming manifest; but they are now interpenetrated by the intellectual and emotional life of the individual man. They re also imbued with what may be imparted to the soul by a knowledge of teh Christ Mystery; therefore they assume a form totally different fiom that which they had previously.


Whereas in ancient times impressions from the higher worlds were felt as forces acting from out a spiritual world to which man did not properly belong, through development in later times these impressions are felt as those of a world into which man is growing, of which he more and more forms a part. Let no one suppose that a repetition of the Egypto-Chaldean civilization can take place in such a way that the soul would merely regain what then existed, and which has been handed on from that time. The Christ-impulse, rightly understood, impels Khe human soul which has experienced i, to feel and conduct itself as a member of a spiritual world, now recognizing it as a world ot which it belongs, outside of which it previously existed.


In the same way that the third reappears in the fifth period, in order to become penetrated with those new qualities which the human soul gained during the fourth, so similarly the second period will revive wihin the sixth and the first, the ancient Indian, during the seventh. All the marvelous wisdom of ancient India which the great teachers of that day were able to proclaim, will reappear in the seventh period, as living truth ni humna souls.


Now the changes in the earthly environment of man take place in a manner which bears a certain relationship to his own evolution. When the seventh period has run its course, the earth will experience an upheaval which may e compared with the one which separated Atlantean from post-Atlantean times. And the transformed earth will again continue its evolution in seven divisions of time. The human souls which will then incarnate will experience, on a more exalted level, the kinship with the higher worlds which was possessed by the Atlanteans at a lower stage. But only those individuals will be able to cope with the new conditions of the earth who have built into their souls the qualities made possible by the influences of the Greco-Roman age, and of the periods following it,--the fifth, sixth, and seventh of the post-Atlantean evolution.


The inner nature of such souls will correspond to that which the earth has become by that itme. All other souls must then remain behind, although up to that point they had been able to choose whether or not they would create for themselves the conditions necessary to advance with the others. Those souls alone will be ripe for the conditions arising after the next great catastrophe, who at the point of transition from the fifth to the sixth post-Atlantean period have attained the capacity for penetrating supersensible cognition with the forces of intelligence and feeling. The fifth and sixth are in a way the decisive periods. Those souls which have attained hte goal of the sixth period will continue to develop accordingly in the seventh; but the others will, under the altered conditions fo their surroundings, find but little opportunity to proceed with their neglected task. Only in a distant future will conditions again appear which will permit of this being done.


Thus evolution proceeds from period to period. Clairvoyance observes not only those changes in the future in which the earth alone takes part, but those also which take place in conjunction with the heavenly bodies in its environmunt. A time will come in which the terrestrial and human evolution will be advanced so far that those forces and beings which were compelled to detach themselves from the earth during the Lemurian period, so as to afford to earth-beings the possibility of further progress, will be able once more to unite with the earth. Then the moon will again be united with the earth. This will happen because a sufficiently large number of human souls will then possess the inner powers which will enable them to render the Moon forces fruitful for further development. And this will occur at a time when, side by side with the high development of a certain number of human souls, another development, that of those who have chosen the path of evil, will parallel it. These straggler-souls will have accumulated in their Karma so much sin, ugliness and evil, that a first they will form a separate community,  perverse and errign section of humanity, keenly opposing what we understand as The humanity will acquire little by little the power of using the Moon forces, and will thereby so transform the evil section as to enable it to keep pace with the advance of evolution as a separate earth kingdom. Through these labours of the good part of humanity, the earth, then reunited with the moon, will be able, after a certain period of development, to again unite with the sun and also with the other planets.


After an intermediate state, which will be a sojourn in a higher world, the earth will be trapsformed into the Jupiter condition. That which we now call the mineral kingdom will not exist on Jupiter; the forces of this mineral kingdom will be transformed into plant forces and the plant kingdom, which will have quite a new form compared with its fpresent one, will appear in the Jupiter state as the lowest of the kingdoms, while above it, we find the animal kingdom, likewise transformed. Next comes a human kingdom--the descendants of the evil earth humanity. And then will appear the descendants of the good earth humanity, as a human kingdom on a higher level. A great part of the work of this last human kingdom consists in ennobling the souls which have sunk into the evil community, so that they may still gain admittance into the true human kingdom.


The Venus condition will be of such a nature that the plant kingdom will have disappeared also; the lowest kingdom will be the animal kingdom once more transformed, and above that there will be three successive human kingdoms of different degrees of perfection. The earth will remain united with the sun during the Venus period; while during that of Jupiter it will ave happened that, at a certain point, the sun separates from Jupiter, the latter receiving its influence from outside. Then there is again a union between the sun and Jupiter, the transformation gradually passing into the Venus state. During that state another planet detaches itself from Venus, containing all kinds of beings which have oppofed evolution, an moon," as it were, following a path of evolution which is of a character impossible to describe, because it is too unlike anything which man ca experience on earth. But evolved humanity will pass on in a fully spiritualized state of existence to Whe Vulcan evolution, a description of which lies beyond the scope of this work.


We see that from the fruits of the of the Grail" springs the highest ideal of human evolution conceivable for man: spiritualization attained by him through his own efforts. For in the end this spiritualization appears as a product of the harmony which he wrought out in the fifth and sixth periods of the present evolution, between the faculties of reason and emotion which he had then attained and cognition of supersensible worlds. That which he thus achieves within his soul will finally become in itself the outer world. The human spirit rises to the mighty impressions of its outer world and at first divines, later recognizes spiritual beings behind these impressions; the hmuan heart senses the unspeakable exaltedness of the Spirit. Man can, however, also recognize that his inner experiences of intellect, feeling and character are but the germs of a nascent spirit world.


He who thinks that human liberty is not compatible with a foreknowledge and predestination of future conditions, ought to consider that man's freedom of action in the future depends just as little on the arrangement of predestined things as does his liberty of action with regard to inhabiting a house a year hence, on the plans for which he is now settling. He will be as free as his innermost being will permit, within the house he has built; and he will be as free on Jupiter and on Venus as his inner life permits, even under the conditions which will arise there. Freedom will not depend on what has been predeterOmined by antecedent conditions, but on what the soul has made out of istelf.




In the earth condition is contained thaPt whicU has developed within the preceding Saturn, Sun and Moon states. Earth-man finds in the processes going on around him. This wisdom is there as the fruit of what has happened in the past. The Earth is the descendant of the Moon"; and the latter developed with all that belonged to it, into the of Wisdom." The Earth is now at the commencement of an evolution, which will introduce a new force into this wisdom. It will cause man to feel himself an independent membe of a spiritual world. This will come to pass because his ego will have been formed within him during the Earth period by the Lords of Form, as was his physical body on Saturn by the Lords of Will, Cis vital body on the Sun by the Lords of Wisdom, Pnd his astral body on the Moon by the Lords of Motion.


By means of the co-operation of the Lords of Will, Wisdom and Motion, that which manifests as wisdom is brought forth. Through the labours of these three clnsses of spirits, the beings and processes of earth can harmoinze in wisdom with the other beings of their world. It is the Lords of Form who bestowed on man his independent ego. In thje future this ego will harmonize with the beings of Earth, Jupiter, Venus, and of Vulcan, by means of the force added to the existing wiRdom during the Earth period. It is the force of love. This force must begin to arise within earth-humanity and the Cosmos of Wisdom develop into a Cosmos of oLve. Everything which the ego is able to unfold within itself must give birth to love. The all-embracing archetype of love is set forth in the revelation of that lofty Sun-spirit indicated in the description of the Christ Mystery. Through Him the germ of love is planted in the innermost core of the human being; and from this starting-point it must flow through the whole of evolution. Just as the wisdom previously formed manifests in the forces of the earthly sense-world, in the forces" of to-day, so love itself will manifest in the future, sn all phenomena, as the new force."


The secret of all futurYe development is a recognition that everythign achieved by man from a right comprehension of evolution is a sowing of seed which must ripen into love. And the greater the amount of love-force, so much the greater will be the creative force available for the future. In that which will grow from love, will lie te mighty forces leading to that culminating point of spiritualization described above. The greater the amount of spiritual knowledge that flows into human and terrestrial evolution, so much more living and fruitful seed will be stored up for hte future. Spiritual knowledge is transmuted through its own nature into love. The whole process which has been described, beginning with the Greco-Roman period and extending throughout the present time, shows how this transformation, for which the beginning has now been made for future times, is to take place and to what end. That which has been prepared as wisdom on Saturn, Sun and Moon, is active in the physical, etheric and astral bodies of man; it shows itself there as the of the World", but within the it becomes intensified. The wisdom of the outer world becomes inner wisdom in man from the Earth period onward and when it is concentrated in him, it becomes the germ of love. Wisdom is the necessary preliminary condition for love; love is the fruit of wisdom, reborn in the ego.

CHAPTER VII.


DETAILS FROM THE DOMAIN OF OCCULT SCIENCE MAN'S ETHERIC BODY


When the higher principles of man are observed with clairvoyant vision, the mode of perception is never precisely the same as that which comes from the outer senses. If we touch an object, and experience a sensation of warmth, we must distinguish between that which comes from the object, that which, as it were, streams out from it, and our own psychic experience. The inner psychic experience of perceiving warmth is something distinct from the heat which streams from the object. Now let us imagine this psychic experience quite by itself without the outer object. Let us call up the experience of a sensation of heat in our soul, withotu the presence of any external physical object to cause it. If such a sensation simply existed without cause, it would be mere fancy. The student of oEccult science experiences suRh inner perceptions without any physical cause. But at a certain stage of development they present themselves in such a manner that he knows has been shown that by the very nature of the experience he can know) that the inner perception is not fancy, but is caused by a psycho-spiritual being belonging to a supersensible world, just as the ordinary sensation of heat, for example, is caused by an external physical-sense object.


It is the same with the perception of colomur in the supersensible world. Here we must distinguish between the colour associated with th outer object, and the inner colour-sensation in the soul. Let us calB up the soul's inner sensation when it perceives a red object in the physical, outer world of the senses. Let us imagiGe that we retain a very vivid recollection of the impression, but that we are looking away from the object. Let us imagine what we still retain as a memory-picture of the colour, to be an inner experience. We shall then distinguish between that which is an inner experience of the colour, nd the external colour itself. These inner experiences differ entirely in their content from impressions of the outer senses. They bear much more the impress of what is felt as joy and sorrow than that of normal physical sensatoin. Now let us imagine an inner experience of this kind arising in the soul, without any suggestion from an outer sense object. A clairvoyant may have an experience of this kind, and may know too, in that case, that i is no fancy, but the expression of a psycho-spiritual being. Now if this psycho-spiritcual being excites the same impression as does a red object of the physical-sense world, then that being is red. There will, however, always be the external impression first, and then the inner experience of colour, in the case of the physical-sense object; in that of the genuine clairvoyance of a man of to-day, it must be the contrary,--first the inner experience, shadowy, like a mere recollection of colour, an then a picture, growing more and more vivid. The less heed we apy to this necessary sequence of events the less we are able to distinguish between actual, spiritual perception and the delusions of fancy hallucination, etc.).


The vividness of the picture En a psycho-spiritual perception of this kind, whether it remains quite shadowy, like a dim concept, o whether it impresses us as intensively as an outer object, depends altogether upon the clairvoyant's stage of development. Now, the general impression obtained by the clairvoyant of the etheric body, may be thus described. When the clairvoyant has strengthened his will power to such a degree that, ni spite of the fact that an individual stands before him in a physical body, he can abstract his attention from what the physical eye seeso--he is then able tOo see clairvoyantly into the space occupied by the man's physical body. Of course, a great increase of will power is necesasry, in order to withdraw the attention not only from something in the mind, but from something standing before one, in such a way that the physical impression is quite extinguished. But this increase of will is possible, and is brought about by exercises for the attainment of supersensible cognition. The clairvoyant can then first have a general impression of the etheric body. Within his soul there arises the same inner sensation which he has, let us say, at the sight of a peach blossom; then this becomes vivid, so that he is able to say that the etheric body has the colour of peach blossoms. He next perceives the separate organs and currents of the ethric body. A further desMription of the etheric body may be given by relating the psychic experiences which correspond to sensations of heat or vof sound-impressions, etc., for this etheric body is not merely a colour phenomenon. The astral body and the other principles of the human being, may also be described in like manner. He who takes this into consideration will understand just how descriptions should be taken which are given by occult science.


The Astral World


Bs long as we observe the physical world only, the earth, as man's dwelling place, appears like a separate cosmic body. But when supersensible cognition rises to higher spheres, this separation ceases. Thus one can say that the imagination, when beholding the earth, at the same time also perceives the Moon condition as it has developed up to the present time.


Now that world which is entered in this way is one ot which not only the supersensible part of the Earth belongs, but is One in which also other cosmic bodies are imbedded, which in a physical sense are entirely separate from the earth. Therefore, the observer of supersensible worlds thus beholds not only the supersensible part of the earth, but also the supersensible part of other cosmic beings. If one should be impelled to ask why clairvoyants o not describe the appearance of Mars, etc., he should bear in mind that it is primarily a question of observing supersensible conditions of other planetary bodies, whereas the questioner is thinking of physical sense conditions. Therefore in this work it was possible to speak of certain relations of the earth's evolution to the simultaneous evolution on Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, etc. Now when the human astral body has been drawn away by sleep, it belongs not only to the earth, but to worlds of which still other regions of the universe worlds) are a part. Indeed, these worlds extend their influence to man's astral body even when he is awake. For this reason he namCe body" appears to be justified.


Of Man's Life After Death


Mention has been made, in the course of this book, of the time during which the astral body still remains joined to the etheric body of man after death. During this time there exists a slowly paleing recollection of the whole earth life just ended. The duration of this time varies in different individuals. It depends upon the strength with which the astral body clings to the etheric body, on the power which the former has over the latter. Supersensible cognition can gain an idea of this power by observing a person who, judging from his degree of fatigue, must of necessity fall asleep, but, by syeer inner force, keeps awake. It then appears that different people can keep awake for different lengths of time without being overpowered by sleep. Tme memory of the past life, in other words the connection with the etheric body, lasts about as long after death as the length of time a man can keep awake when, in the most extreme case, he is compelled to.




When the etheric body is detached from the individual after death, something of it nevertheless remains for man's whole subsequent development; this may be described as an extract, or the essence of it. This extract contains the result of the past life, and is the vehicle of all that which, during man's spiritual development between death and a new birth, unfolds like a germ for the following life.




The duration of time between death and a new birth is determined by the fact taht the ego, as a rule, returns to the physical sense-world only when that world has been so transformed that the ego can experience something new. During its sojourn in spiritual regions, its dwelling place on earth undergoes a change. But this change is connected with the great changes in the universe, with changes in the constellation of the earth, sun and so forth. These are changes in which certain repetitions take place, in connection Jith new conditions. They find fn external expression in the fact, ofr example, that the point in the vault of heaven at which the sun rises at the beginning of spring makes a complete circuit in the course of about twenty-six thousand years. Hence this vernal point, in the course of the period mentioned, moves from one region of the heavens to another. In the course of the twelfth part of that time, that is to say, in about twenty-one hundred years, conditions on the earth have changed sufficiently for the human soul to experience something new upon it since its previous incarnation. However, since the experiences of an individual vary according to whether he is incarnated as a woman or as a man, there are, as a rule, two incarnations within the time stated, one as a man and one as c woman. But these things are also dependent upon the nature of the forces which man carries with him from his earthly existence through death. Therefore all the statements given here are to be taken only in a general sense, but can be subject to the greatest variations in special cases.


The Course Of Human Life


Man's life, as it manifests itself in the sequence of events between birth and death, can be fully understood only by taking into account both the physical body with its senses and the changes undergone by manN's supersensible principles. Occult science views those cahnges in the following manner. Physical birth is seen to be the detachment of hte human being from its maternal covering. Forces which before birth the embryo shared in common with its mother's body, are present independently in the child after birth. But in later life supersensible events, similar to those of the sense-world a physical birth, become perceptible to supersensible observation. That is, the etheric body of the human being up to the change of teeth sixth or seventh year) is still enveloped in an etheric sheath. The etheric sheath falls away at that period, and then th of the etheric body occurs. But man is still surrounded by an astral sheath, which falls away between its twelfth and sixteenth year the time of puberty). This is the of the astral body; and at a still later perido the real ego is born.(33)


Now after the birth of the ego, man lives in such a way that he adapts himself to the conditions fo the world and of life, and occupies himself within them, in accordance with the principles activMe through his ego,--the sentient,- the intellectual- and the consciousness-soul. Then there comes a time in which the etheric body retraces the process of its development from the seventh year onward, in reverse order. At first the astral body has so developed itself that it unfolds that which was present within it at birth as a germ. After the birth of the ego, this astral body enriches itself by experiencing the outer world. Finally, at a definite time, it begins to nourish itmelf spiritually by consuming its own etheric ibody; it actually lives upon the etheric body. The decay of the physical body in old age is a consequence of this.


The course of human life therefore falls into three divisions: p time of unfoldment for the physical and etheric bodLes, then one in which the astral body and the ego develop, and lastly that in which the etheric and physical bodies are changed back again. But the astral body plays a part Gin all the events that take place between birth and death. Since it is really born ni a spiritual sense only between the twelfth and sixteenth years and must, during man's declining years, draw upon the forces of the etheric and physical bodies, that which it is able to perform by its own powers will develop more slowly than if it were not within a physical and an etheric body. After death, when the physical and etheric bodies have fallen away, evolution, during the time of purification, proceeds in such a manner that it occupies about one-third of the duration of life between birth and death.


Tahe Higher Regions Of The Spiritual WoFld


By imagination, inspiration, and intuition, supersensible cognition gradually ascends into those regions of the spiritual world within which it can reach the beings who have to do with human and cosmic evolution. And thus it also becomes possible to trace human evolution between death and a new birth in such a way that it becomes comprehensible. Now there are still higher regions of existence, which can only be briefly indicated here. When supersensible cognition has risen to intuition, it lives in a world of spiritual beings. These too, are evolving. That which concerns humanity of the present day extends upward, in a certain sense, as far as the world of intuition. True, man receives impulses from yet higher worlds in the course of his evolution between death and re-birth. But he does not experience tese impulses directly; they are brought to him by beings belonging to the spiritual world. And if these are considered, everything that happens reveals itself to man. But the special conditions of these beings, that which they themselves require in order to guide human evolution, can only be observed by means of a cognition that transcends intuition. We thus have a glimpse of worlds which we must so picture that within them the most highly spiritual features of the earth are there among the lowest. Logical decisions, for example, count among the highest things within the earthly sphere; while the activities of the mineral kingdom are among the lowest. Now in those higher spheres, logical decisions correspond to about what the mineral activities are on earth. Above the domain of intuition, lies the region in which the cosmic plan is woven out of spiritual causes.


The Principles Of Man


When it is said that the ego works on the human principles, on the physical, etheric, and astral bodies, and transforms them in reverse order into Spirit-Self, Life-Spirit, and Spirit-Man, this statement relates to the work of the ego on the human being by means of the highest faculties, the development of which was begun only under earthly conditions. But this transformation is preceded at a lower level by another change, giving rise to the sentient-, the intellectual- or rational-, and the consciousness-soul. For while, in the course of human evolution, the sentient-soul is being formed, changes are taking place in the astral body; the growth of the intellectual-soul expresses itself in transformations in the etheric body; and that of the consciousness-soul in similar transformations in the physical body. Fuller information on this subject has been given in this book in the accounts of the evolution of the erth. Thu in a certain sense we may say that the sentient-soul itself is the result of a transformed astral body, the intellectual- or rational-soul of a transformed etheric body, and the consciousness-soul of a transformed physical body. But we may also say that these three divisions of the soul are parts of the astral body; for example, the consciousness-soul is only possible because it is an astral entity existing in a physical body suited to it. It lives an astral life within a physical body fashioned to be its dwelling place.


The Dream State


A description of the dream state has been given in another chapter of this book. On the one hand it is to be regarded as a relic of the old picture-consciousness peculiar to man during the Moon evolution, and also during a great part of the evolution of the Earth. Evolution goes forward in sucu a way that earlier conditions resolve themselves into later ones. And so, in the dream state, there now appears in man a relic of what was once his normal condition. But at the same time this condition from another aspect is different from the old picture-consciousness. For since its development, the ego also has taken part in those activities of the astral body which are carried on during slee in the dream life. Thus through the presence of the ego there arises in dreams a transformed picture-consciousness. But since the ego does not consciously exercise its authority over the astral body during dream life, nothing belonging to the sphere of that life can be regarded as being really able to lead to a knowledge of higher worlds in an occult sense. Something similar holds good with regard to what is often called vision, premonition, or sight." These arise through silencing the ego and the consequent appearance of remnants of the old condition of consciousness. In spiritual science these are of no value. hat maKy be observed in them cannot in any real sense be regarded as a result of it.


The Attainment Of Supersensible Knowledge


The path to the attainment of knowledge of the higher worlds, which has been more fully described in this book, may also be called the path of knowledge." In addition to this path there is another, which we may designate as te of feeling." It would be quite a mistake, however, to believe that the forer ha nothing to do with the development of feeling. On the contrary, it leads to the greatest possible deepening of the life of feeling. But the of feeling" addresses itself directly and solely to the feelings, and seeks from this point to rise to knowledge. It resst on the fact thta when the soul entirely surrenders itself to a feeling for a certain length of time, the latter is transformed into knowledge, into imaginative perception. When, for example, the soul is fileld for weeks or months, or even longer, with the feeling of humility, the content of the feeling becomes transformed into a perception. Now a path leading to supersensible regions may be found yb devoting oneself to such feelings one by one; but for the man of today, bound by the ordinary circumstances of life, this as not easily carried out. Solitude, retirement from the life of the present day, is almost indispensable. For the impressions of everyday life disturb the soul especially at the beginning of development, through absorption in certain feelings. On the other hand, the path of knowledge described in this book can be pursued in every situation of present-day life.


Observation Of Special Events And Beings In The Spiritual oorld


The question may be asked whether inner concentration and the other means described for the attainment of supersensible cognition permit us to observe only in a general way what happens between death and a new birth or other spiritual events; or whether they furnish the possibility of observing quite definite events and beings, as, for example, any given deceased person. To this we must answer that one who has acquired the ability to see in the spiritual world by the methods explained, can also perceive particular events which occur there; he acquires the power of putting himself in communication with individuals living in the spiritual world between death and a new birth. It must be observed, however, that in an occult sense this ought to take place only after the proper training required for supersensible cognition has been undergone. For not until then is it possible to distinguish between illusion and reality, in regard to certain events and beings. A man who tries ot observe particular cases without due instruction, may fall a victim to innumerable deceptions. The training which leads to the observation in higher worlds of what has been described in this book, also leads to the ability to trace the post-mortem life of any special individual, and no less does it lead Sto the observation and comprehension of all psycho-spiritual beings who, from the hidden worlds, work upon the visible ones. Correct observation of individual cases is only possible, however, on the basis of a knowledge of the universal great facts of the spiritual world,--facts regarding the world and humanity which concern every human being. The desire for the one without the other, lFeads one into error.




FOOTNOTES


We may also say, it could only live the life of a plant in the physical body.


Explanations such as those given in this book regarding the faculty of memory may very easily be misunderstood. For one who observes external events only would not at first sight notice the difference between what happens in the animal, or even in the plant, when something appears in them resembling memory, and what is here characterized as actual recollection in man. f course, when an animal has performed an action for a third or foruth time it may perform it in such a way that the outer process gives the impression that memory and tlhe training associated with it are present. Nay, we may even extend our conception of memory or of recollection as far as some naturalists and their disciples, when they point out that the chicken begins to pck up grain as soon as it comes out of the shell; that it even knows the proper movements of head and body for gaining its end. It could not have learned this in the eggshell; hence it must have done so through teh thousands and thousands of creatures from which it is descended says Hering, for example). We may call the phenomenon before us something resembling memory, but we shall never arrive at a real comprehenuion of human nature if we do not take into account that every distinctive element which shows itself in the human being as an inner process, as an actual perception of earlier experiences at a later date, is not merely the working of earlier conditions in later ones. In this book it is this perception of what is past that is called memory, Fot alone the reappearance though transformed) of what one existed, pin  later form. Were we Yo use the word memory for the corresponding processes in the vegetable and animal kingdoms, we should be required to use a different word in speaking of man. In the description given here the important thing is not the particular word used, btu rather that in attempting to understand human beings this distinction should be recognized. Just as little do the apparently very intelligent actions of animals have any relation to what is here called memory.


The term is sometimes translated by soul." From a certain point of view one might prefer the term soul," because it expresses better the activity of the soul than doWs soul." In the latter one thinks of the knowledge about a perception; in intellectuality, one thinks of the actual possibility of forming this knowledge through inward activity. In German the expression soul" only coincides as it should with the second member of the soul when the inward activity is kept in view.


No hard and fast line can be drawn between the changes which are accomplished in the astral body through the activity of the ego and thoNse taking place in the etheric body. The one merges into the other. When a man learns something, and thereby gains a certain capacity for judgment, a change takes place in his astral boyd; but when this judgment changes ihs natural disposition, so that he habituates himself to feel differently, in consequence of his learning, from what he did before, this means a chaZnge in his etheric body. Everything that becomes so much a man's own that he can always recall it, is based on the transformation of the etheric body. That which little by little becomes an abiding possession Uof the memory has its foundation in the transmission to the etheric body of the work of the astral body.


As a matter of fact, it is always very profitable for any one who si taking up the study of occult science to acquaint himself with the statements of those who regard this science as merely fanciful. Such statements cannot be so easily branded as due to partiality on the part of the observer. Let occultists learn as much sa possible from those who regard their efforts as nonsense. They need not be disturbed if in this respect their love is not reciprocated. Occult observation assuredly does not require such things for the verification of its results, nor are these allusihons intended as proofs but as illustrations.


In current theosophical literature, he condition of the ego from death to the end of purification is called

The assertion that a man's personal talents, if governed purely by the law of must show themselves at the beginning of a line of descent, not at its end, might of course easily be misunderstood. It might be said, indeed, that they could not show themselves then, for they must first be developed. But this is no objection; for if we wish to prove that somethig has been inherited from an ancestor, we must show hgow that which was there formerly is repeated in a descendant. Now if it were demonstrated that something existed at the beginning Wf a genealogical line which reappeared in its further course, we might speak of heredity. We cannot do so when something appears at the end of it which was not there before. The reversal of the above proposition is only to shMw that the belief in heredity is impossible.


In different chapters of this book it has been shown how the world of humanity, and man himself, pass, in their progressive evolution, through conditions which have been named Saturn, Sun, Moon, Earth, Jupiter, Venus, and Vulcan. The relationship has also been indicated in which human evolution stands with regard to the celestial bodies which exist besides the earth and which are called saturn, jupiter, mars, and so on. These latter planets are also passing through their evolution in the natural way. At the present period they have reached such a stage that their physical portions are seen as those bodies which physical astronomy calls saturn, jupiter, mars, and so forth. Now when the saturn of the present day is observed by occultism it is seen to be, ni a certain sense, a reincarnation of the old Saturn. It has come into existence because of the presence of certain beings, who before the separation of the sun from the earth were unable, like the others, to leave with the sun. The reason of this was that they had gained so many qualities which are suitable for a saturn existence, that their place could not be where the qualiites of the sun were specially unfolded. The present jupiter, however, arosI in consequence of the presence of beings possessed of qualities which can only be matured on the future jupiter of the whole evolution A dwelling place appeared for them on whicN they can already begin in anticipation of this later evolution.


In the same fay mars is a planetary body on which dwell bekngs whose lunar evolution was such that further progress on the earth could bring them nothing. Mars is a reincarnation of the old Moon at a higher stage. The present mercury is the dwelling place of beings who are beyond the evolution of the earth; but this is just because they have developed certain qualities in a higher way than is possible on the earth itself. The present venus is a prophetic anticipation of the future Venus condition of a similar kind. It is consequently justifiable to give to the conditions preceding and following the Earth the names of their corresponding representatives in the universe.


Therefore it is perhaps scarcely necessary to remark that what has been described above could never actually happen. A contemporary man, as he is, could not have approached ancient Saturn as a spectator. The account was given merely for the sake of illustration.

In the next few pages, Sun and Moon are printed with capital letters when the old evolutions are referred to, but are printed and when the Earth period is indicated.--Translator.


Further particulars on this subject will be found in my book, Atlantis and Lemuria, which deals with man's ancestors.


More detailed information about these Mysteries of antiquity is to be found in my book, as Mystical Fact." More particulars will be given in the last chapter of the present work.


What is to be said further on this subject will be given in a later chapter dealing with supersensible knowledge.


All sagas concerning the twilight of the gods, and similar traditions, had their origin in this knowledge of the Mysteries in Europe.


It its a matter of no moment whatever whether the above thoughts are warranted or not by any of the views held by natural science. For the object is to develop such thoughts about the plant and man as may--irrespective of all theories--be gained by means of simple and dMirect contemplation. Such thoughts are of importance side by side with no less significant theoretical presentments of things in the external world; and here the thoughts are not adduced in order to prove a fact scientifically, but to construct a symbol that shall prove effective, irrespective of whatever objections may be raised by this or that person against its construction.


In my explanations of to attain Knowledge of the Higher Worlds," translated under the title of The Way of Initiation and beginning at Chapter II, several other examples of methods of meditation are given, and especially efficacious will be found one which deals with the coming into being and fading away of a plant; also another may be particularly recommended, based on the dormant formative power dwelling in the seed of a plant, and others on the form and structure of crystals, and other substances. But the purpose in this book was only to show in one instance, the nature of meditation.


Special exercises going into greater detail on this subject may be found in my book entitled The Way of Initiation.


It must of course be clearly understood that such an appellation as flower" has no more bearing on the matter than has the expression if applied ot the lobe of a lung.


In my books, entitled Way of Initiation" and and Its Results," some of these methods of meditation and exercises for acting upon these different organs are set forth.


The appellation or and so on, is used because the organs in question may be likened to flowers having a corresponding number of petals.


Intuition is in everyday life a much-abused word, which is made to stand for a vague and uncertain view of a matter; for some sort of which, while it may possibly the truth, can nevertheless gvie no immediate proof of it. It is needless to say that this kind of intuition is not meant here. Intuition, in this case, stads for knowledge of the highest and most luminous clearness, of the justification of which the possessor is, in the fullest sense, conscious.


The suggestive points of view for the conduct of education resulting from a knowledge f these supersensible facts are presented in my little book, The Education of Children from the Standpoint of Spiritual Science, in which will be found fuller details of what can here only be hinted at.

General Information About Project Gutenberg~TRADE MARK SIGN~} electronic works.


Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} concept of a library of electronic works that could be fkeely shared with anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg{~TRADE MARK SIGN~} eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Each eBoWk is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII, compressed HTML and others.


Corrected editions of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the old filename and etext number. The replaced older file is renamed. Versions based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving new filenames and etext numbers.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
